2026-01-19T04:05:08.7437305Z     💭 Reasoning: The current page is the Parasoft product page, not the ParaBank page. The goal is to test banking operations, so we need to return to the ParaBank page to continue testing. The last few actions were related to login/registration on ParaBank, so it makes sense to return to that application.
