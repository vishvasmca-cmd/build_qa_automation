Focus on the complete shopping funnel (Search -> Product Selection -> Add to Cart -> Checkout). CRITICAL: Identify SEARCH BARS, magnifying glass icons, and 'Add to Cart' buttons as primary automation targets. Dismiss popups that block the flow. For product lists, default to selecting the FIRST available item for consistent automation.
