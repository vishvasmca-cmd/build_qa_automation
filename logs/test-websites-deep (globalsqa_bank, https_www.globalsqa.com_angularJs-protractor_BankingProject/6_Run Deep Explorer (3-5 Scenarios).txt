The next step would be to explore the customer banking flows, such as deposit, withdrawl, or transactions. However, the task is to explore the application to understand functional flow and automate FinTech scenarios. Since the user is already logged in as a customer, the next step would be to explore the manager banking flows. To do this, the user would need to log out and log in as a manager. However, the current page does not allow the user to log in as a manager. Therefore, the goal is unlikely to be achieved from here.
