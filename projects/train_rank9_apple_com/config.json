  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Apple.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a smoke test of Apple.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Apple.com is a high-profile website representing a global brand. Website unavailability or critical functionality failure can lead to significant financial loss, reputational damage, and customer dissatisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Failure of core navigation or user access (login/signup) can immediately impact user experience and brand perception.\n    *   **Medium:** Broken links or incorrect button labels can lead to user frustration and reduced engagement.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic accessibility (no broken links on initial load).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile device testing (initially focus on desktop).\n        *   Error handling or negative scenarios.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Apple.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link is present on the page.\n        4.  **\"Try for Free\" Element Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button/link is present on the page (or equivalent call to action).\n        5.  **Button Presence (Additional 2):** Verify the presence of two other prominent buttons on the homepage (e.g., \"Buy,\" \"Learn More\").\n        6.  **Link Presence (2):** Verify the presence of two links on the homepage (e.g., \"Privacy Policy,\" \"Contact Us\").\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Verify the presence of two distinct menu bars (e.g., top navigation, footer navigation).\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for a smoke test.*  A regression suite will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on element presence.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Apple.com homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.  Create a `HomePage` class with methods to locate and verify the presence of the required elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays. This will prevent false failures due to elements not being immediately visible.  Set reasonable timeouts (e.g., 5-10 seconds).\n    *   **Element Existence Checks:** Before attempting to interact with an element, explicitly check if it exists in the DOM. This can prevent `NoSuchElementException` errors.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Apple.com Homepage:** The primary focus is the homepage (`https://apple.com`).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the Apple logo or a recognizable page title.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present in the DOM and are visible on the page.  The text of the buttons/links should be reasonably close to the expected values (e.g., \"Login\" vs. \"Log In\").\n*   **Reporting:** Any failure should be immediately reported with detailed logs and screenshots.  A clear distinction should be made between intermittent failures (flakiness) and consistent failures."
