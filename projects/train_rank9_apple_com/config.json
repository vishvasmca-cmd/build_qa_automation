  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Apple.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the smoke testing of Apple.com. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Apple.com is a high-profile website representing a global brand. Its availability and functionality are critical for maintaining brand reputation, driving sales, and providing customer support.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failure of core functionalities on Apple.com can lead to significant financial loss, damage brand reputation, and erode customer trust. Even brief outages can impact a large user base.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence, not functionality (no clicking).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Responsiveness testing across different devices/browsers (beyond basic rendering).\n        *   Accessibility testing (beyond basic rendering).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Negative testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Website Launch**: Navigate to `https://apple.com` and verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Login Element**: Verify the presence of a \"Login\" or equivalent button/link.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element**: Verify the presence of a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" or equivalent button/link.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element**: Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" or equivalent button/link.\n        5.  **Button 4**: Verify the presence of another prominent button (e.g., \"Buy,\" \"Learn More\").\n        6.  **Button 5**: Verify the presence of another prominent button (e.g., \"Support,\" \"Contact Us\").\n        7.  **Link 1**: Verify the presence of a prominent link (e.g., \"Privacy Policy,\" \"Terms of Use\").\n        8.  **Link 2**: Verify the presence of another prominent link (e.g., \"Accessibility,\" \"Site Map\").\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1**: Verify the presence of a main menu bar (e.g., \"Store,\" \"Mac,\" \"iPad\").\n        10. **Menu Bar 2**: Verify the presence of a secondary menu bar (e.g., \"Accessories,\" \"Entertainment\").\n*   **Regression Suite**: Not applicable for smoke testing.\n*   **Data Strategy**: No test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**: While a full Page Object Model (POM) might be overkill for this simple smoke test, a basic structure is still recommended for maintainability.  Create a `HomePage` class that encapsulates the locators for the elements being verified.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to allow elements to load asynchronously.  This helps avoid false failures due to timing issues.  Set a reasonable timeout (e.g., 5 seconds).\n    *   **Locator Strategy**: Prioritize robust locators (e.g., `id`, `data-testid`) over fragile locators (e.g., `xpath` based on text content).\n    *   **Self-Healing (Optional)**: For a more robust solution, consider implementing a basic self-healing mechanism that attempts to re-locate elements if the initial locator fails.  This could involve trying alternative locators or using visual validation techniques.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    *   **Primary Target**: `https://apple.com`\n    *   **Element Identification**: Focus on identifying the specified elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars) on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Success**:\n        *   The website loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        *   All specified elements are present on the page.\n    *   **Failure**:\n        *   The website fails to load (HTTP error).\n        *   Any of the specified elements are missing.\n*   **Reporting**:  Report any failures immediately.  Include screenshots and detailed error messages to aid in debugging."
