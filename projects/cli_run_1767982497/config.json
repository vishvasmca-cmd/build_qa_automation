This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n```markdown\n# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm\n**Business Domain:** General Banking Application\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nParaBank is a demonstration banking application. While not a real-world system, failures can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss (Simulated):** Incorrect transactions, inability to access funds.\n*   **Data Breach (Simulated):** Exposure of user account information.\n*   **Trust Loss (Simulated):** Damage to the perceived reliability of the application.\n\nGiven the nature of a banking application, even a demo, the core functionalities related to accounts, transactions, and user data are considered **P0 (Priority 0)**.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nThe primary risks associated with ParaBank are:\n\n*   **Incorrect Financial Calculations:** Errors in interest calculations, transaction amounts, or account balances.\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized users to access accounts or perform transactions.\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Corruption or loss of account data.\n*   **Functional Defects:** Bugs that prevent users from completing essential tasks.\n*   **Performance Issues:** Slow response times or application crashes that disrupt the user experience.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **User Registration:** Creating new user accounts.\n*   **Login/Logout:** Authenticating and de-authenticating users.\n*   **Account Management:** Opening new accounts (checking and savings), viewing account details, updating profile information.\n*   **Fund Transfers:** Transferring funds between accounts.\n*   **Bill Payment:** Paying bills to registered payees.\n*   **Transaction History:** Viewing account transaction history.\n*   **Customer Service:** Contacting customer service representatives.\n*   **All UI elements and their interactions.**\n*   **Error Handling and Validation Messages.**\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 basics).**\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Advanced Security Testing (Penetration Testing, Fuzzing):** While basic security checks are in scope, comprehensive security testing is not.\n*   **Performance Testing (Load, Stress, Endurance):** Focused on functional regression, not performance.\n*   **API Testing (Directly):** Primarily UI-driven testing.\n*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility (Beyond Major Browsers):** Focus on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.\n*   **Mobile Testing:** Testing on mobile devices is not explicitly in scope.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will consist of the following critical path tests:\n\n1.  **Login Success:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n2.  **Account Summary Load:** Verify the account summary page loads after login.\n3.  **Transfer Funds (Basic):** Verify a simple fund transfer between two existing accounts.\n\nThese tests must pass for a build to be considered stable enough for further testing.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will cover the following areas:\n\n*   **User Registration:**\n    *   Valid registration with all required fields.\n    *   Invalid registration with missing or incorrect data (e.g., invalid email format, weak password).\n    *   Duplicate username registration.\n*   **Login/Logout:**\n    *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n    *   Failed login with invalid credentials (e.g., incorrect username, incorrect password).\n    *   Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.\n    *   Logout functionality.\n*   **Account Management:**\n    *   Opening new checking and savings accounts.\n    *   Viewing account details (balance, transactions).\n    *   Updating profile information (address, phone number).\n    *   Closing accounts.\n*   **Fund Transfers:**\n    *   Transferring funds between accounts (checking to savings, savings to checking).\n    *   Transferring funds with insufficient balance.\n    *   Transferring funds with invalid account numbers.\n    *   Transferring zero or negative amounts.\n*   **Bill Payment:**\n    *   Adding new payees.\n    *   Paying bills to registered payees.\n    *   Paying bills with insufficient funds.\n    *   Paying bills with invalid payee information.\n*   **Transaction History:**\n    *   Viewing account transaction history for different time periods.\n    *   Filtering transactions by type (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, transfers).\n*   **Customer Service:**\n    *   Submitting inquiries through the customer service form.\n    *   Verifying that inquiries are received and processed.\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid inputs in all forms (e.g., special characters, SQL injection attempts).\n    *   Boundary values for numeric fields (e.g., minimum and maximum amounts).\n    *   Timeouts and network failures during transactions.\n    *   Empty states and error handling for missing data.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users accessing the same account simultaneously.\n    *   Large data sets: Testing with a large number of accounts and transactions.\n    *   Unexpected input: Handling unexpected characters or data formats.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks:\n        *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n        *   Password security (e.g., password strength requirements, hashing).\n        *   Session management (e.g., secure cookies, session timeout).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** A set of pre-defined user accounts and account data for basic scenarios.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generated data for scenarios requiring unique values (e.g., new user registrations, unique transaction amounts).\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   Test data will be stored in a secure and accessible location (e.g., CSV files, database).\n    *   A data generation script will be used to create dynamic test data.\n    *   Data cleanup procedures will be implemented to remove test data after test execution.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Language:** Java or Python are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n*   **Testing Framework:** JUnit or pytest.\n*   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ or Hamcrest.\n*   **Reporting:** Allure or Extent Reports.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with a test.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically recover from common test failures (e.g., element not found, network timeout). This could involve retrying actions or re-locating elements.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for flaky tests caused by network issues or server instability.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages and flows first:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify basic elements and links.\n2.  **Registration Page:** Explore all input fields and validation messages.\n3.  **Login Page:** Test valid and invalid login attempts.\n4.  **Account Summary Page:** Verify account details and transaction history.\n5.  **Transfer Funds Page:** Test fund transfers between accounts.\n6.  **Bill Payment Page:** Test bill payments to registered payees.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all requests return a 200 OK status code for successful operations.\n*   **UI Element Verification:** Verify that all UI elements are displayed correctly and have the expected attributes (e.g., text, labels, values).\n*   **Validation Messages:** Verify that appropriate validation messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n*   **Data Integrity:** Verify that data is stored and retrieved correctly (e.g., account balances, transaction history).\n*   **Functional Correctness:** Verify that all functional requirements are met (e.g., fund transfers are processed correctly, bills are paid on time).\n*   **Security Checks:** Verify that basic security checks are in place (e.g., input validation, password security).\n\n**Success Definition:**\n\n*   All critical functionalities are working as expected.\n*   No high-priority defects are found.\n*   The application is stable and reliable.\n*   The test suite provides adequate coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n```\n"
