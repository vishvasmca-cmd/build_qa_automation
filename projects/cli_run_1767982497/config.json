  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. I need to create a Master Test Strategy document for ParaBank, focusing on regression testing and covering the user's goal of registration, login, opening a savings account, and transferring funds. Here's the plan:\n\n```markdown\n# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm\n**Business Domain:** Banking (Simulated)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nParaBank, while a demo application, simulates a real banking system.  The core functionalities revolve around user accounts, transactions, and financial data.  Therefore, data integrity and security are paramount.  Critical functionalities, ranked by priority (P0 being highest), are:\n\n*   **P0:** Login, Fund Transfer, Account Creation\n*   **P1:** Registration, Balance Inquiry, Transaction History\n*   **P2:** Profile Update, Bill Pay (if implemented)\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure in ParaBank can lead to:\n\n*   **Data Corruption:** Incorrect balances, lost transactions.\n*   **Security Breaches:** Unauthorized access to accounts, data leaks.\n*   **Functional Errors:** Inability to perform core banking operations.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of user trust (even in a demo context).\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user registration, login, account creation (checking and savings), fund transfer, balance inquiry, and transaction history.\n*   Negative testing for all input fields (e.g., invalid usernames, passwords, amounts).\n*   Boundary value testing for numerical fields (e.g., minimum/maximum transfer amounts).\n*   Security testing for common vulnerabilities (see Regression Suite below).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   Accessibility testing (basic checks for screen reader compatibility).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n*   Mobile testing (unless specifically requested).\n*   Bill Pay (unless implemented and explicitly included).\n*   API testing (unless APIs are exposed and documented).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure the core system is functional.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Verify the ParaBank homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    2.  Verify a user can successfully log in with valid credentials.\n    3.  Verify a logged-in user can view their account summary page.\n\n*   **Environment:** Staging environment.\n*   **Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass. Failure of any test case indicates a critical issue and should block further testing.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Functional Testing:**\n    *   **Registration:**\n        *   Valid registration with all required fields.\n        *   Invalid registration with missing fields.\n        *   Registration with existing username.\n        *   Registration with invalid email format.\n    *   **Login:**\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Failed login with invalid username.\n        *   Failed login with invalid password.\n        *   Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.\n    *   **Account Creation:**\n        *   Create a new checking account.\n        *   Create a new savings account.\n        *   Verify initial deposit is correctly reflected.\n    *   **Fund Transfer:**\n        *   Transfer funds between accounts.\n        *   Transfer funds with insufficient balance.\n        *   Transfer zero amount.\n        *   Transfer a negative amount.\n        *   Transfer to a non-existent account.\n    *   **Balance Inquiry:**\n        *   Verify account balance is displayed correctly.\n    *   **Transaction History:**\n        *   Verify transaction history is displayed correctly.\n        *   Verify transaction details are displayed correctly.\n        *   Filter transaction history by date range.\n        *   Filter transaction history by transaction type.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid input for all text fields (special characters, SQL injection attempts).\n    *   Boundary value testing for numerical fields (minimum/maximum values).\n    *   Attempt to access restricted pages without authentication.\n    *   Simulate network errors (timeouts, connection resets).\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users performing transactions simultaneously.\n    *   Large data sets: Test with a large number of accounts and transactions.\n    *   Empty states: Verify appropriate messages are displayed when no data is available.\n\n*   **Security Testing:**\n    *   **OWASP Top 10 Basics:**\n        *   **SQL Injection:** Attempt to inject SQL code into input fields.\n        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attempt to inject malicious scripts into input fields.\n        *   **Broken Authentication:** Test for weak password policies and session management vulnerabilities.\n        *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Verify sensitive data (e.g., passwords, account numbers) is not exposed in transit or at rest.\n        *   **Security Misconfiguration:** Check for default passwords and insecure configurations.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:** A set of pre-defined user accounts with varying balances and transaction histories.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generated data for registration and transaction testing (e.g., random usernames, amounts).\n    *   **Data Management:** Test data will be managed in a separate database or CSV files.  Scripts will be used to populate the database with test data before each test run.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a separate class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   **Language:** Java or Python are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n    *   **Testing Framework:** JUnit (Java) or pytest (Python) for test execution and reporting.\n    *   **Web Driver:** Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met. This will help to reduce flakiness caused by asynchronous operations.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement a mechanism to automatically recover from common errors, such as element not found exceptions.  This could involve retrying the operation or navigating to a different page.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed test cases. This will help to reduce flakiness caused by intermittent network issues or server errors.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Priority Order):**\n    1.  **Registration Page:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/register.htm\n    2.  **Login Page:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm\n    3.  **Account Summary Page:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/summary.htm\n    4.  **Open New Account Page:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/openaccount.htm\n    5.  **Transfer Funds Page:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/transfer.htm\n    6.  **Account Activity Page:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/activity.htm\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all pages return a 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Verify that all required elements are present on the page (e.g., input fields, buttons, labels).\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that the correct text is displayed on the page (e.g., welcome message, account balance).\n    *   **Data Integrity:** Verify that data is correctly stored and retrieved from the database.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input.\n    *   **Security:** Verify that the application is protected against common security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing ParaBank. It will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it remains relevant and effective.\n```\n"
