While not a real-world financial institution, failures can simulate real-world banking errors. The core functionalities are:\n\n*   **User Registration:** Allows new users to create accounts.\n*   **Login:** Grants access to existing user accounts.\n*   **Account Management:** Opening new accounts, viewing balances, and transaction history.\n*   **Funds Transfer:** Moving money between accounts.\n\n**Business Criticality:**\n\n*   **P0 (Critical):** Login, Funds Transfer. Failure in these areas directly impacts the user's ability to access and manage their funds.\n*   **P1 (High):** User Registration, Opening New Accounts. These are essential for onboarding new customers and expanding the bank's user base.\n*   **P2 (Medium):** Account Details, Transaction History. Important for user experience and transparency.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nSystem failures in ParaBank can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss (Simulated):** Incorrect fund transfers or account balances.\n*   **Data Breach (Simulated):** Exposure of user credentials or account information.\n*   **Trust Loss:** Users losing confidence in the application's reliability.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to User Registration, Login, Account Management, and Funds Transfer.\n*   Positive and negative test scenarios for all input fields.\n*   Boundary value testing for account balances and transfer amounts.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions).\n*   Basic security testing (OWASP Top 10 - input validation).\n*   Performance testing (response times for key transactions).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance - basic checks).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n*   Mobile application testing (if applicable).\n*   Integration with external systems (if any).\n*   Detailed accessibility testing beyond basic checks.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionalities are working.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n    *   Verify the main account overview page loads successfully after login.\n    *   Verify a successful funds transfer between two existing accounts.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All smoke tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of all functionalities.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts with incorrect credentials.\n    *   Attempting to transfer funds with insufficient balance.\n    *   Submitting registration forms with missing or invalid data.\n    *   Inputting special characters in username and password fields.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrent user logins.\n    *   Network failures during fund transfers.\n    *   Empty account states.\n    *   Large transfer amounts.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n    *   Password complexity requirements.\n    *   Session management and timeout.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data Generation:** Use a test data generation library (e.g., Faker) to create realistic and varied test data for user registration, account details, and transfer amounts. This ensures that the tests are not dependent on static data and can cover a wider range of scenarios.\n    *   **Data Masking:** Ensure that any sensitive data used in testing is masked or anonymized to protect user privacy.\n    *   **Database Management:** Implement a strategy for managing the test database, including regular backups and restores to ensure data integrity.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a separate class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Programming Language:** Java or Python are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n*   **Testing Framework:** JUnit or TestNG (Java), pytest (Python).\n*   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ (Java), Pytest Assertions (Python).\n*   **Reporting:** Allure or Extent Reports for detailed and visually appealing test reports.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Awaitility in Java) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically recover from common test failures, such as element not found errors. This can involve retrying the action or re-locating the element.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement retry logic for flaky tests, with a maximum number of retries and a delay between retries.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Registration Page:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/register.htm\n2.  **Login Page:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm\n3.  **Account Overview Page:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/overview.htm\n4.  **Transfer Funds Page:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/transfer.htm\n5.  **Open New Account Page:** https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/openaccount.htm\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Page Load:** HTTP 200 status code and relevant page content (e.g., \"Welcome\" text on the account overview page).\n*   **Successful Login:** User is redirected to the account overview page.\n*   **Successful Registration:** User is redirected to the account overview page and a new account is created.\n*   **Successful Funds Transfer:** The balance of the source account is decreased, and the balance of the destination account is increased by the transfer amount. A confirmation message is displayed.\n*   **Error Handling:** Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or failed operations.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing ParaBank. It will be regularly reviewed and updated as the application evolves.\n```\n"
