  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the SauceDemo application (https://www.saucedemo.com/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSauceDemo is a demonstration e-commerce application. While not a real-world revenue-generating system, it simulates critical e-commerce functionalities. The most critical areas, from a testing perspective, are:\n\n*   **Login/Authentication:** Secure access to the application.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Display and filtering of products.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and modifying items.\n*   **Checkout Process:** Entering shipping information, payment details, and order confirmation.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the SauceDemo application, while not directly impacting revenue, can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Confidence:** If the application is used for training or demonstration purposes, failures can erode confidence in the underlying technology or processes.\n*   **Misleading Results:** Inaccurate or unreliable behavior can lead to incorrect conclusions during testing or experimentation.\n*   **Delayed Learning:** Bugs and defects can hinder the learning process for new users or engineers.\n\nTherefore, a robust testing strategy is crucial to ensure the application's reliability and accuracy.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user login, product browsing, adding items to the cart, checkout process, and order confirmation.\n*   Positive and negative test scenarios for all input fields and user interactions.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Basic security testing (input validation, XSS prevention).\n*   Performance testing (page load times, response times).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed performance testing under heavy load.\n*   Advanced security penetration testing.\n*   Integration with external systems (e.g., payment gateways).\n*   Mobile application testing (if applicable).\n*   Localization testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with a valid `standard_user` account.\n    *   Verify the product catalog page loads successfully and displays products.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect username/password).\n    *   Invalid input in shipping/billing address fields (e.g., special characters, exceeding maximum length).\n    *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart.\n    *   Submitting the checkout form with missing required fields.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Adding a large number of items to the cart.\n    *   Simultaneous access by multiple users (concurrency).\n    *   Simulating network failures during checkout.\n    *   Handling empty states (e.g., empty cart, no search results).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent XSS attacks.\n    *   Checking for SQL injection vulnerabilities in input fields.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Test Data:** Use a set of predefined usernames, passwords, product names, and addresses for basic testing.\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data Generation:** Generate random data for input fields to cover a wider range of scenarios.  Consider using libraries like Faker.js or similar.\n    *   **Data Management:** Store test data in a centralized location (e.g., JSON files, database) for easy access and maintenance.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a separate class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n*   **Language:**  Recommend using a popular language like JavaScript (with frameworks like Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium WebDriver) or Python (with Selenium WebDriver).\n*   **Assertion Library:** Use a robust assertion library like Chai (JavaScript) or Pytest (Python) for verifying expected results.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met (e.g., element to be visible, clickable) before proceeding with the test.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common issues, such as element locators changing.  This could involve using multiple locators for the same element and trying them in sequence.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for flaky tests caused by network issues or environment instability.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Focus on different login credentials (valid, invalid, locked out).\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html` - Explore product filtering, sorting, and individual product details.\n3.  **Shopping Cart:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html` - Test adding, removing, and modifying items.\n4.  **Checkout Pages:**\n    *   `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-one.html` - Input shipping information.\n    *   `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html` - Review order details.\n    *   `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-complete.html` - Order confirmation.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Page Load:** Verify that each page loads successfully with an HTTP 200 status code.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Ensure that key elements on each page are visible and interactable (e.g., login button, product images, add to cart button).\n*   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text elements are displayed correctly (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product names, order confirmation message).\n*   **Functional Verification:** Ensure that core functionalities are working as expected (e.g., adding items to the cart, submitting the checkout form).\n*   **Error Handling:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input or unexpected conditions.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the SauceDemo application. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the application's reliability, accuracy, and overall quality.\n"
