  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the SauceDemo application (https://www.saucedemo.com/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSauceDemo is a demonstration e-commerce application. While not a real-world business, it simulates typical e-commerce functionalities. The most critical areas, from a testing perspective, are:\n\n*   **Login:** Authentication is the gateway to the application.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying and filtering products.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and modifying items.\n*   **Checkout:** Completing the purchase process.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the SauceDemo application, while not causing direct financial loss, can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Confidence:** If the application is used for training or demonstration purposes, failures can erode trust in the underlying technology or processes.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** If used in public demos, failures can negatively impact the perceived quality of the software or organization.\n*   **Blocked Learning:** If used for learning, failures can block the learning process.\n\nTherefore, a robust testing strategy is crucial to ensure the application's reliability and stability.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user authentication (login/logout).\n*   Product catalog browsing and filtering.\n*   Adding products to the cart.\n*   Modifying and removing products from the cart.\n*   Checkout process (including information entry and order confirmation).\n*   Error handling and validation messages.\n*   Basic UI elements and their responsiveness.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, etc.).\n*   Detailed security penetration testing (beyond basic input validation).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   API testing (unless explicitly required for core functionality).\n*   Mobile testing (unless explicitly required).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Verify successful login with a valid `standard_user` account.\n    2.  Verify that the product catalog page loads successfully after login.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** If any test fails, the build is rejected.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect username/password).\n    *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart.\n    *   Entering invalid data during checkout (e.g., incorrect postal code format).\n    *   Submitting empty forms.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Adding a large number of items to the cart.\n    *   Simultaneous user logins (concurrency).\n    *   Handling network connectivity issues during checkout.\n    *   Testing with different browser window sizes (responsiveness).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks (e.g., special characters in login fields, address fields).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:** Predefined usernames and passwords for different user roles (e.g., `standard_user`, `locked_out_user`, `problem_user`, `performance_glitch_user`).\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generated product names, addresses, and other data to ensure test data uniqueness and avoid conflicts.\n    *   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a separate configuration file or database.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should have a corresponding Page Object class that encapsulates the page's elements and actions.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures (e.g., retrying failed assertions, refreshing the page).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. The retry mechanism should be configurable and allow for a certain number of retries with a specified delay between each retry.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Integrate with a reporting tool (e.g., Allure, Extent Reports) to generate detailed test reports with screenshots and logs.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page:** Focus on different login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials, locked-out user).\n    2.  **Product Catalog Page:** Explore product filtering options (price, name).\n    3.  **Product Details Page:** Verify product information and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n    4.  **Shopping Cart Page:** Test adding, removing, and modifying items.\n    5.  **Checkout Pages:** Thoroughly test the checkout process with different data inputs.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all requests return a 200 OK status code (except for expected error scenarios).\n    *   **Text Visibility:** Verify that expected text elements are visible on the page (e.g., \"Welcome, [Username]\", product names, prices).\n    *   **Element Attributes:** Verify that elements have the correct attributes (e.g., correct image source, correct link URLs).\n    *   **Form Submission:** Verify that form submissions are successful and redirect to the correct page.\n    *   **Error Messages:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n*   **Test Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize tests based on risk and business impact. Focus on testing the most critical functionalities first.\n    *   Use a risk-based testing approach to allocate testing resources effectively.\n*   **Environment Management:**\n    *   Ensure that the test environment is properly configured and maintained.\n    *   Use a dedicated test environment to avoid conflicts with other development activities.\n"
