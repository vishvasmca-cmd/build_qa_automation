My mandate is to create a comprehensive Master Test Strategy for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing and the user goal of logging in as a standard user and verifying products. Here's the Markdown report:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com Regression Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nSaucedemo.com is a demonstration e-commerce website. While not a real e-commerce platform, it simulates typical e-commerce functionality. Key areas include:\n\n*   **Login:** Authentication and access control.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Display and filtering of products.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and managing items.\n*   **Checkout:** Order placement and payment simulation.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure of Saucedemo.com, while not causing direct financial loss, can impact:\n\n*   **Reputation:** If used for training or demonstration purposes, failures can reflect poorly on the organization.\n*   **Learning:** Bugs can hinder the learning process if the platform is used for training.\n*   **Confidence:** Unreliable demos can erode confidence in testing tools and methodologies.\n\nTherefore, while the business impact is low, a robust testing strategy is still crucial for maintaining a reliable and effective demonstration platform.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user login (positive and negative scenarios).\n*   Product catalog display, filtering, and sorting.\n*   Adding products to the shopping cart.\n*   Shopping cart management (quantity updates, removal of items).\n*   Checkout process (simulated).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge).\n*   Basic security checks (input validation).\n*   Responsive design testing (mobile and desktop).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n*   Integration with external systems (payment gateways, shipping providers).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - *Consider adding this in the future*.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will verify the core functionality of the application after each build.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with `standard_user` credentials.\n    *   Verify that the product catalog page loads successfully after login.\n    *   Verify that at least one product can be added to the cart.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Login:**\n    *   **Positive:** Login with valid credentials (`standard_user`, `locked_out_user`, `problem_user`, `performance_glitch_user`).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Invalid username.\n        *   Invalid password.\n        *   Locked-out user.\n        *   SQL Injection attempts in username and password fields.\n*   **Product Catalog:**\n    *   Verify product display (name, description, price, image).\n    *   Verify product filtering (by price, name).\n    *   Verify product sorting (by price, name).\n    *   Verify \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n*   **Shopping Cart:**\n    *   Verify adding multiple products.\n    *   Verify updating product quantities.\n    *   Verify removing products.\n    *   Verify correct subtotal calculation.\n    *   Verify navigation to the checkout page.\n*   **Checkout:**\n    *   Verify checkout with valid shipping information.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Checkout with missing shipping information.\n        *   Checkout with invalid shipping information (e.g., special characters in name).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrent user logins.\n    *   Network failures during checkout (simulated).\n    *   Empty shopping cart scenarios.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent XSS and SQL injection.\n    *   Check for sensitive data exposure in browser console.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static:** Predefined user credentials (e.g., `standard_user`, `locked_out_user`).\n    *   **Dynamic:** Dynamically generated shipping information (e.g., using Faker library).\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a separate configuration file or database.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to improve code maintainability and reusability. Each page of the application should have a corresponding Page Object class.\n*   **Language:** Python with Pytest or Javascript with Mocha/Chai/Cypress.\n*   **Reporting:** Allure or similar reporting framework for detailed test execution reports.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_until` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and element loading.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed test cases due to temporary network issues or server instability.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing capabilities of testing tools to automatically recover from minor UI changes.\n*   **Environment Stability:**\n    *   Ensure a stable and consistent test environment.\n    *   Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to create reproducible test environments.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** Focus on all possible login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials, locked-out user).\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:** Explore product display, filtering, and sorting functionalities.\n3.  **Shopping Cart Page:** Explore adding, removing, and updating products in the cart.\n4.  **Checkout Page:** Explore the checkout process with valid and invalid shipping information.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected elements are visible on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product names and prices on the product catalog page).\n    *   Form submissions are successful (e.g., successful login, product added to cart).\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Incorrect data display.\n    *   Broken links.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing Saucedemo.com. It will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the application.\n```\n"
