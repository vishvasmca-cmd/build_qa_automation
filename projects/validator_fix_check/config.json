  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. My mandate is to create a comprehensive Master Test Strategy for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing and the specific user goal of logging in as `standard_user` and verifying the products page. Here's the breakdown:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com Regression Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://www.saucedemo.com/\n**Business Domain:** General E-commerce (Demo)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n**User Goal:** Login as `standard_user` and verify products\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nSaucedemo.com, while a demo application, simulates a typical e-commerce platform. Key functionalities include:\n\n*   **Authentication:** User login and logout.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying and filtering products.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and modifying items.\n*   **Checkout:** Completing the purchase process.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nAlthough a demo site, failures can impact perceived reliability and trust in the underlying testing framework/tooling. Specific risks include:\n\n*   **Authentication Failure:** Inability to log in prevents access to core functionality.\n*   **Product Display Issues:** Incorrect product information or inability to view products impacts user experience.\n*   **Checkout Errors:** Failure to complete the checkout process represents a critical business failure (simulated).\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** While a demo, exposing vulnerabilities could be exploited.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user login, product browsing, adding items to the cart, and simulating the checkout process.\n*   Positive and negative login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials).\n*   Product filtering and sorting.\n*   Cart management (add, remove, update quantities).\n*   Basic checkout flow simulation (entering shipping information, payment details - no actual payment processing).\n*   UI validation (elements present, correct labels, etc.).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   Basic security checks (input validation).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Payment gateway integration (as it's a demo).\n*   Detailed performance testing (load, stress).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n*   Mobile testing (unless specifically requested).\n*   API testing (unless explicitly required for specific features).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will be executed after each build to ensure core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.saucedemo.com/`.\n    2.  Verify the login page is displayed.\n    3.  Login with `standard_user` and `secret_sauce`.\n    4.  Verify successful login and redirection to the products page.\n    5.  Verify at least one product is displayed on the products page.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Authentication:**\n    *   Valid login with `standard_user`.\n    *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect username, password, locked out user).\n    *   Logout functionality.\n*   **Product Catalog:**\n    *   Verify product names, descriptions, and prices are displayed correctly.\n    *   Verify product images are loaded.\n    *   Filtering products by price (low to high, high to low).\n    *   Sorting products by name (A to Z, Z to A).\n*   **Shopping Cart:**\n    *   Add products to the cart.\n    *   Remove products from the cart.\n    *   Update product quantities in the cart.\n    *   Verify the cart total is calculated correctly.\n    *   Verify the cart icon displays the correct number of items.\n*   **Checkout:**\n    *   Enter valid shipping information.\n    *   Enter valid payment information (dummy data).\n    *   Complete the checkout process (simulation).\n    *   Verify the order confirmation page is displayed.\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Attempt to add more items to the cart than available in stock (if applicable).\n    *   Enter invalid characters in input fields (e.g., special characters in name fields).\n    *   Attempt to proceed to checkout with an empty cart.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Test with different browser window sizes (responsive design).\n    *   Simulate network latency (slow connections).\n    *   Test with large numbers of products in the cart.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent XSS and SQL injection (e.g., try injecting `<script>` tags or SQL commands into input fields).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** Primarily static data will be used for login credentials (`standard_user`, `secret_sauce`).\n*   **Dynamic Data:** For checkout information (name, address, etc.), use a combination of static and dynamically generated data (e.g., using Faker libraries).  This will help avoid issues with duplicate data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should be represented by a Page Object class, encapsulating the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable. This helps mitigate flakiness caused by timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits for specific elements to load.\n*   **Self-Healing (Consider):** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI-powered element locators) to automatically adapt to UI changes.  This is a more advanced technique and should be evaluated based on the frequency of UI changes.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for those that are known to be flaky.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Focus on different login attempts (valid, invalid).\n2.  **Products Page:** `/inventory.html` (after successful login) - Focus on product display, filtering, and sorting.\n3.  **Product Details Page:** (Clicking on a product) - Focus on product information and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n4.  **Shopping Cart Page:** `/cart.html` - Focus on adding, removing, and updating items.\n5.  **Checkout Pages:** `/checkout-step-one.html`, `/checkout-step-two.html`, `/checkout-complete.html` - Focus on entering information and completing the checkout process.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Login:** HTTP 200 status code AND the presence of the `/inventory.html` URL AND the presence of at least one product element on the page.\n*   **Product Display:** HTTP 200 status code AND the presence of product name, description, and price elements for each product.\n*   **Add to Cart:** HTTP 200 status code AND the cart icon displays the correct number of items.\n*   **Checkout Completion:** HTTP 200 status code AND the presence of the \"Thank you for your order!\" message on the `/checkout-complete.html` page.\n*   **Error Messages:** Verify the presence and correctness of error messages for invalid input (e.g., invalid login credentials, missing checkout information).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for regression testing Saucedemo.com. It should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the application and evolving testing needs.\n```\n"
