  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the SauceDemo application (https://www.saucedemo.com/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSauceDemo is a demonstration e-commerce application. While not a real-world business, it simulates typical e-commerce functionalities. The most critical functionality, for demonstration purposes, is the ability to successfully log in, view products, and add them to the cart.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the SauceDemo application, while not causing direct financial loss, can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Trust:** If the application is used for demonstrations or training, failures can erode confidence in the underlying technology or processes.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Public failures can negatively impact the perception of the software or the organization using it.\n*   **Delayed Demonstrations/Training:** Bugs can disrupt planned demonstrations or training sessions, leading to wasted time and resources.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities accessible through the user interface (UI).\n*   Login and authentication processes.\n*   Product catalog browsing and filtering.\n*   Adding products to the cart.\n*   Checkout process (simulated).\n*   Error handling and validation messages.\n*   Basic security checks (input validation).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).\n*   Responsive design (desktop and mobile).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   API testing (unless explicitly required for UI functionality).\n*   Database testing (direct database access).\n*   Detailed security penetration testing.\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Localization testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with `standard_user` credentials.\n    *   Verify the product catalog page loads successfully after login.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All smoke tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect username/password).\n    *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart (if applicable).\n    *   Invalid input in checkout forms (e.g., missing required fields, invalid postal code).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Adding a large number of items to the cart.\n    *   Simultaneous user logins (concurrency).\n    *   Simulating network failures during checkout (e.g., slow connection).\n    *   Empty cart scenarios.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities (e.g., special characters in login fields, product search).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Test Data:** Use predefined usernames and passwords (e.g., `standard_user`, `locked_out_user`, `problem_user`, `performance_glitch_user`).\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data:** Generate random data for checkout forms (e.g., first name, last name, postal code).  This can be achieved using libraries like Faker.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should have a corresponding Page Object class that encapsulates the elements and actions on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures (e.g., retrying failed assertions, re-locating elements).\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits and use explicit waits to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them. This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  Focus on different login scenarios (valid, invalid, locked-out user).\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:** Explore product filtering, sorting, and individual product details.\n3.  **Cart Page:**  Test adding, removing, and modifying items in the cart.\n4.  **Checkout Flow:**  Test the entire checkout process, including filling out forms and submitting the order.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Login:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Products\" text visible on the product catalog page.\n*   **Product Added to Cart:** HTTP 200 status code AND the cart icon displays the correct number of items.\n*   **Checkout Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Thank you for your order!\" text visible on the confirmation page.\n*   **Error Messages:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs (e.g., invalid login credentials, missing required fields).\n"
