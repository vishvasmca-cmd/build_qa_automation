  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Smoke Testing for spo-msedge.net\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the website spo-msedge.net. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The target URL appears to be a general web application, potentially related to Microsoft Edge or SharePoint Online (SPO). The business criticality depends on the application's purpose. If it's a core service, failures can impact user productivity and access to critical resources.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities like website launch, login, or signup can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of User Access:** Inability to access the application.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user experience and loss of trust.\n    *   **Potential Revenue Loss:** If the application is tied to paid services.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of Login functionality.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of Signup/Get Started/Try for Free (or similar) functionalities.\n        *   Presence of 5 key buttons on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of 2 key links on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of Login/Signup processes (e.g., password validation, account creation).\n        *   Clicking and navigating through the menu bars.\n        *   Clicking any of the buttons or links.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid credentials).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome or Edge).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic accessibility and presence of key elements on the website.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully.\n    2.  **Login Presence:** Verify the Login button/link is present and visible.\n    3.  **Signup/Get Started Presence:** Verify a Signup/Get Started/Try for Free (or similar) button/link is present and visible.\n    4.  **Button Count:** Verify at least 5 buttons are present on the homepage.\n    5.  **Link Count:** Verify at least 2 links are present on the homepage.\n    6.  **Menu Bar Count:** Verify at least 2 menu bars are present on the homepage.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (N/A - Smoke Test Only):** Since this is a smoke test, a full regression suite is not applicable. Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it primarily focuses on the presence of elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** A lightweight framework is sufficient for this smoke test. Consider using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   **Page Objects:** Create a `HomePage` object containing locators for the Login button, Signup button, and other key elements.\n    *   **Test Cases:** Write test cases that use the `HomePage` object to verify the presence of these elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** The primary target is the homepage (`https://spo-msedge.net`).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code AND the page title contains a relevant keyword (e.g., \"Microsoft\", \"SharePoint\", \"Edge\").\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the page. Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify these elements.\n    *   **No Exceptions:** No JavaScript errors or unhandled exceptions occur during page load.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the spo-msedge.net website. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the application's core functionality is working as expected, reducing the risk of critical failures."
