  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Smoke Testing for spo-msedge.net\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the website spo-msedge.net. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The website appears to be a general web application, potentially related to Microsoft Edge or SharePoint Online (SPO). The business criticality depends on the specific purpose of the site (e.g., marketing, documentation, service portal).\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or core functionalities to work can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception of Microsoft Edge or SharePoint Online.\n    *   **Lost Opportunities:** Inability for users to access information or services.\n    *   **Reduced User Adoption:** Frustration leading to users abandoning the platform.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar) buttons.\n        *   Identification of 2 links.\n        *   Identification of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Detailed functionality of any linked pages.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid credentials).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Accessibility testing (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health and accessibility of the spo-msedge.net website.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Launch and Element Identification**\n        *   **Description:** Verify the website loads successfully and key elements are present.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to `https://spo-msedge.net`.\n            2.  Verify the page loads without errors (HTTP 200 OK).\n            3.  Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons (e.g., Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free).\n            4.  Verify the presence of at least 2 links.\n            5.  Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on the presence and accessibility of elements, not their functionality.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\nThis section provides guidance for the Test Architect on building a robust and maintainable test automation framework.\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the website's pages and their elements. This will improve code reusability and maintainability.\n        *   Create a base `Page` class with common functionalities (e.g., navigation, element identification).\n        *   Create specific page classes for each page on the website (e.g., `HomePage`, `LoginPage`).\n        *   Each page class should contain elements (e.g., buttons, links, menu bars) as properties.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential loading delays. This will prevent false failures due to elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\nThis section provides instructions for the Senior QA on executing the smoke tests and identifying potential issues.\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage:** Focus on the initial landing page (`https://spo-msedge.net`) as the primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 OK status code for the website.\n        *   Presence of at least 5 buttons (with relevant text like \"Login\", \"Signup\", \"Get Started\", \"Try for Free\").\n        *   Presence of at least 2 links (any links on the page).\n        *   Presence of at least 2 menu bars (any menu bars on the page).\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   Website fails to load (HTTP error codes).\n        *   Any of the required elements are missing or not identifiable.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Report any failures immediately to the development team.\n    *   Provide detailed information about the failure, including screenshots and error messages.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the spo-msedge.net website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the application's core functionality is working as expected."
