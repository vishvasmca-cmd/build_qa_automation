  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Smoke Testing for Azurewebsites.net\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Azurewebsites.net application. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The application is a general web application. While the specific business purpose is unknown, a failed launch or inability to access core features can lead to a negative user experience and potential loss of trust.\n*   **Risk Profile:** The primary risks associated with a failed launch include:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the organization.\n    *   **Lost Opportunities:** Potential users may be unable to access the application and its features.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Presence and basic functionality of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of buttons, links, and menu bars (e.g., clicking and navigating).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health and accessibility of the Azurewebsites.net application.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully without errors.\n    2.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of the following elements on the homepage:\n        *   Login button/link\n        *   Signup/GetStarted button/link\n        *   Try for Free button/link\n        *   Two additional buttons/links (any)\n        *   Two menu bars\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on UI element presence.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended. This will allow for easy maintenance and scalability as the testing scope expands.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java` (or equivalent): Contains locators and methods for interacting with elements on the homepage.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with a reasonable timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) to handle potential delays in element loading. This will reduce flakiness caused by timing issues.\n    *   **Example (Conceptual):**\n        ```java\n        // Pseudo-code\n        waitForElementToBeVisible(loginButtonLocator, 5);\n        assertTrue(isElementPresent(loginButtonLocator));\n        ```\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** The primary focus is the homepage of the Azurewebsites.net application.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200 (OK).\n        *   No critical JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n    *   **Element Presence:**\n        *   The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page.\n        *   Elements are visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS or other means).\n        *   Elements are enabled (i.e., not disabled).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   A clear pass/fail report should be generated after each smoke test run.\n    *   Any failures should be investigated and resolved promptly.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the Azurewebsites.net application. It will be reviewed and updated as the application evolves and the testing scope expands."
