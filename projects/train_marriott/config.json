Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agent on which elements and pages to prioritize for deeper analysis and potential test case generation beyond the smoke tests.\n\n**3.1. Prioritized Elements for Mining:**\n\n*   **Search Form (Find & Reserve):**  Extract all input fields (destination, dates, guests), labels, placeholders, and validation rules. Pay special attention to the datepicker element.\n*   **Hotel Cards/Listings:**  When search results are displayed, mine all data points from hotel cards (hotel name, star rating, price, amenities, location).\n*   **Filters/Sorting:**  Analyze available filters (price range, amenities, hotel brands) and sorting options.\n*   **Property Details Page:**  Scrape all available data: description, images, amenities list, room types, policies, reviews, map integration.\n*   **Marriott Bonvoy Section:**  If the agent can identify a \"Sign In\" or \"Join Now\" button, mine the associated forms and links.\n*   **Footer Links:** Mine all URLs and text of the footer links.\n\n**3.2. Prioritized Pages for Mining:**\n\n*   **Homepage:** Focus on hero section, promotional banners, and featured destinations.\n*   **Search Results Page:**  Essential for understanding how hotels are presented and filtered.\n*   **Hotel Details Page:** The core of the booking process.\n*   **Deals Page (if any):** Analyze how promotions are displayed and applied.\n*   **Bonvoy Enrollment/Login Pages:**  If accessible.\n\n**3.3. Mining Strategy:**\n\n*   **Data Extraction:**  Focus on extracting *structured* data (e.g., hotel name, price, dates).\n*   **Element Identification:** Use a combination of:\n    *   **Semantic HTML:**  Prioritize elements with meaningful tags (e.g., `<input>`, `<button>`, `<article>`).\n    *   **CSS Selectors:**  Use specific CSS selectors to target elements with consistent styling.\n    *   **ARIA Attributes:**  Leverage ARIA attributes for accessibility to identify interactive elements.\n*   **Pattern Recognition:**  Look for repeating patterns in the HTML structure, especially in search results and hotel listings.\n\n**3.4. Data Storage:**\n\n*   The agent should store the mined data in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV) for later analysis and test case generation. Include the element's tag name, attributes (including classes), text content, and URL.\n\n## 4. Success Criteria\n\n*   The smoke tests should pass consistently, indicating that the core website functionality is operational.\n*   The strategic mining process should successfully extract a significant amount of structured data from the prioritized elements and pages.\n*   The mined data should be well-organized and readily usable for test case generation.\n\n## 5. Reporting\n\n*   **Smoke Test Results:**  Detailed report of pass/fail status for each test case, including error messages and screenshots (if any).\n*   **Mining Report:**  Summary of the data extracted, including the number of elements and pages mined, data formats used, and any challenges encountered.\n*   **Test Plan Updates:** This document will be updated based on the results of the smoke tests and mining activities.\n\n```\n\n**Explanation and Key Improvements:**\n\n*   **Detailed Domain Analysis:**  Provides context for the agent, helping it understand the business purpose of Marriott.com.\n*   **Clear Smoke Test Definitions:**  Provides precise steps and expected results for each test case.  Includes HTTP status code check, which is crucial for availability testing.\n*   **Strategic Mining Instructions:** This is the most important part.\n    *   **Prioritized Elements and Pages:**  Focuses the agent's efforts on the most critical areas.\n    *   **Mining Strategy:**  Provides specific guidance on how to identify and extract data, including the use of semantic HTML, CSS selectors, and ARIA attributes. This makes the mining process more robust and accurate.\n    *   **Data Storage:**  Specifies the desired format for storing the mined data.\n*   **Success Criteria:**  Defines what constitutes a successful execution of the test plan.\n*   **Reporting:**  Outlines the required reports for the smoke tests and mining activities.\n*   **Test Environment:**  Important to specify which browsers and devices to test against.\n*   **Focus on *Structured* Data:**  Emphasizes the importance of extracting data that can be easily used for test case generation.\n*   **Actionable Instructions:** The instructions are written in a way that an autonomous agent can easily understand and execute.\n\nThis plan provides a solid foundation for smoke testing Marriott.com and gathering the data needed for future test case development.  The agent can now proceed with executing the smoke tests and strategically mining the website based on these instructions.  Good luck!"
