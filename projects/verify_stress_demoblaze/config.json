  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: DemoBlaze E-Commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the comprehensive test strategy for the DemoBlaze e-commerce application, ensuring the delivery of a high-quality and reliable user experience. This strategy serves as the blueprint for all testing activities, including manual and automated testing.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n**Analyze the Domain:**\n\nDemoBlaze is an e-commerce platform, where the core business revolves around enabling users to browse, purchase, and manage orders. Key functionalities include user authentication, product catalog management, shopping cart operations, and checkout processes.  A failure in any of these areas can directly impact revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n**Determine Risk Profile:**\n\nSystem failures in DemoBlaze can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Loss of sales due to checkout errors, inaccurate pricing, or payment processing issues.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative customer reviews and loss of trust due to a poor user experience, security vulnerabilities, or unreliable functionality.\n*   **Operational Disruptions:** Inability to process orders, manage inventory, or fulfill customer requests.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised user data (personal information, payment details) due to security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Define Testing Scope:**\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   User Registration, Login, and Logout\n    *   Product Catalog Browsing and Searching\n    *   Shopping Cart Functionality (Add, Update, Remove Items)\n    *   Checkout Process (Address Input, Payment Processing, Order Confirmation)\n    *   Basic Security Checks (Input Validation)\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Detailed performance testing (load, stress) - unless specifically identified as high-risk.\n    *   Integration with external services beyond basic payment gateway simulation.\n    *   Comprehensive security penetration testing.\n    *   Detailed cross-browser and cross-device compatibility beyond major browser families.\n    *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - initial focus on core functionality.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n**Overall Approach:** A risk-based testing approach will be adopted, prioritizing testing efforts based on the criticality of the functionality and the potential impact of failures. A combination of smoke and regression testing will be employed.\n\n**Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n*   **Purpose:**  To quickly verify the basic functionality of the application after a build or deployment.\n*   **Frequency:** Run after every build.  A failed smoke test indicates a critical problem that blocks further testing.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   Verify User Login (Valid Credentials)\n    *   Verify Homepage Loads Correctly with Product Listings\n    *   Verify Adding a Product to Cart\n\n**Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To ensure that new changes have not introduced defects into existing functionality.\n*   **Frequency:** Run after each significant code change or feature implementation.\n*   **Examples (Building on User Goal + Domain Playbook):**\n    *   **Authentication:**\n        *   Login with Invalid Password\n        *   Login with Locked Account\n        *   Password Reset Flow\n        *   Registration with Existing Email\n    *   **Product Catalog:**\n        *   Filter products by Price/Category\n        *   Sort products (Price Low-High)\n        *   Search for non-existent product\n        *   Verify Pagination\n    *   **Shopping Cart:**\n        *   Update Quantity in Cart\n        *   Remove Item from Cart\n        *   Add Out-of-Stock Item (Verify Error)\n        *   Cart Persistence (Refresh Page)\n    *   **Checkout & Payments:**\n        *   Checkout with formatted Address\n        *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code\n        *   Payment Decline Simulation\n        *   Calculate Tax/Shipping correctly\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid input in Name field (special characters, very long string) during checkout.\n        *   Invalid Credit Card number format.\n        *   Attempt to add more items to the cart than available in inventory.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Checkout with multiple items in the cart.\n        *   Concurrent user access to the same product during checkout (race condition).\n        *   Network interruption during payment processing.\n        *   Empty search results page handling.\n    *   **Security (Basic OWASP Checks):**\n        *   Input validation to prevent basic SQL injection attempts in search fields, login, and registration.\n        *   Input validation to prevent basic Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attempts in product reviews or user profile fields.\n\n**Data Strategy:**\n\n*   **Approach:** A hybrid approach will be used:\n    *   **Static Test Data:** Pre-defined, consistent data sets for core functionalities like login and product catalog browsing. These will be stored in configuration files or database tables.\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data Generation:** Using code to generate unique and varied test data for scenarios like user registration, order placement, and data input fields.  This reduces data dependencies and improves test coverage.  Libraries like Faker will be leveraged if appropriate.\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   Sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) will be masked or encrypted in test environments.\n    *   Test data will be regularly refreshed to maintain consistency.\n    *   A data dictionary will be maintained to document the purpose and structure of test data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n**Framework Recommendation:**\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  A modular approach where each page of the application is represented by a class. This improves code maintainability, reduces code duplication, and simplifies test creation.  All tests will follow POM.\n\n**Resilience Strategy:**\n\n*   **Flakiness Mitigation:**\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading.\n    *   **Polling Assertions:**  Implement retry mechanisms for assertions that may occasionally fail due to timing issues.  Example: Retry an assertion for up to 5 seconds with a 500ms delay.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common failures, such as re-locating elements or retrying failed actions. (e.g. if an element isn't immediately found, re-try finding it).\n*   **Error Handling:**\n    *   Implement robust error handling to catch and log exceptions during test execution.\n    *   Provide informative error messages to facilitate debugging.\n    *   Capture screenshots or videos of failed tests for analysis.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n**Mining Targets:**\n\nBased on the user goal and business priorities, the autonomous agent should prioritize the following areas for exploration:\n\n1.  **Homepage Product Listings:** Verify product display, navigation, and search functionality.\n2.  **Product Detail Pages:**  Validate product information, pricing, and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n3.  **Shopping Cart:** Test adding, updating, and removing items from the cart.\n4.  **Checkout Process:**  Focus on address input, payment processing, and order confirmation.\n5.  **User Registration and Login:** Explore different registration scenarios and login attempts.\n6.  **\"Laptops\" Category:** Specifically explore products within the \"Laptops\" category.\n7.  **\"Monitors\" Category:** Specifically explore products within the \"Monitors\" category.\n\n**Verification Criteria:**\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP Status Codes: 200 OK for successful page loads and API requests.\n    *   Element Presence: Verify the presence of key elements on each page (e.g., product title, price, \"Add to Cart\" button).\n    *   Text Verification: Validate specific text on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, order confirmation message).\n    *   Database Integrity: For critical operations (e.g., order placement), verify data consistency in the database.\n    *   No JavaScript Errors: Monitor browser console for JavaScript errors.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP Status Codes: 4xx or 5xx errors indicate client-side or server-side issues.\n    *   Missing Elements: Key elements are not displayed on the page.\n    *   Incorrect Text: Incorrect information is displayed.\n    *   JavaScript Errors: JavaScript errors in the console.\n    *   Data Inconsistencies: Discrepancies between the UI and the database."
