Introduction\n\nThis Master Test Plan outlines the smoke testing strategy for [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io).  The plan focuses on verifying the core functionality and availability of the website.  This plan will guide the autonomous agents to perform targeted exploration, identify critical elements, and create a robust smoke test suite.\n\n## 2. Domain Analysis\n\n*   **Domain:** Web Application Testing Framework\n*   **URL:** [https://www.cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io)\n*   **Business Goal:**  To promote and sell the Cypress testing framework, encouraging users to adopt it for their web application testing needs.  Success is measured by user engagement, downloads, and conversions to paid subscriptions.\n*   **Target Audience:**  Web developers, QA engineers, and SDETs.\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   Homepage showcasing the benefits of Cypress.\n    *   Documentation for using the framework.\n    *   Pricing and subscription information.\n    *   Blog and resources for the testing community.\n    *   User Dashboard.\n\n## 3. Smoke Test Suite Definition\n\nThe Smoke Test Suite aims to quickly verify the stability and core functionality of the Cypress.io website after deployment or updates.  It focuses on critical \"happy path\" scenarios.\n\n### 3.1. Scope\n\nThe following tests will be included in the smoke test suite:\n\n*   Website Availability\n*   Core Navigation\n*   Key User Flow: Navigate to Cypress homepage, verify the hero headline, find and click the 'Get Started' button, and assert new page load.\n\n### 3.2. Test Cases\n\n| Test Case ID | Description                                                                              | Priority | Steps                                                                                                                                    | Expected Result                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SMOKE-001    | Verify Website Availability                                                               | High     | 1. Navigate to [https://www.cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io)                                                                       | The website should load successfully without any errors (e.g., 404, 500).                                                                                                                                               |\n| SMOKE-002    | Verify Core Navigation                                                                   | High     | 1. Navigate to [https://www.cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io) 2. Verify all main navigation links are present and clickable.       | All main navigation links (e.g., \"Why Cypress?\", \"Pricing\", \"Docs\", \"Company\") should be visible and lead to the correct corresponding pages without errors.                                                     |\n| SMOKE-003    | Verify Hero Headline Text                                                                  | High     | 1. Navigate to [https://www.cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io) 2. Locate the main hero headline on the homepage.                          | The hero headline should contain the exact text: \"Fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser.\"                                                                                               |\n| SMOKE-004    | Verify \"Get Started\" Button Functionality                                                | High     | 1. Navigate to [https://www.cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io) 2. Locate the \"Get Started\" button on the homepage. 3. Click the button. | Clicking the \"Get Started\" button should navigate the user to the documentation page (https://docs.cypress.io/), and the page title should contain \"Introduction\".                                                         |\n\n## 4. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agents on prioritizing elements and pages during exploration to maximize test coverage and efficiency.\n\n*   **Prioritize Homepage Analysis:** The homepage is the most critical page.  Focus on identifying and extracting:\n    *   All headings (especially the hero headline).\n    *   All links (navigation, call-to-action buttons, footer links).\n    *   Images (especially those with alt text).\n    *   Forms (if any)\n*   **Navigation Menu Mining:** Extract all links and their target URLs from the main navigation menu.  This will be used to verify navigation functionality.\n*   **\"Get Started\" Button Identification:**  Specifically target the \"Get Started\" button on the homepage and extract its attributes (text, link URL, CSS selectors). This element is crucial for a key user flow.\n*   **Documentation Page Mining:**  After clicking \"Get Started\", analyze the target documentation page and identify key elements such as headings, links to sub-sections, and any interactive elements. This verifies successful navigation and content loading.\n*   **Dynamic Content Areas:** If any carousels or dynamically changing content areas exist on the homepage, flag them for further investigation and potential testing of different states.\n\n## 5. Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:**  Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n\n## 6. Test Data\n\n*   No specific test data is required for the smoke tests defined in this plan. The tests primarily focus on verifying the functionality of existing elements and navigation.\n\n## 7. Success/Failure Criteria\n\n*   **Success:** All smoke test cases pass. This indicates that the core functionality of the website is working as expected.\n*   **Failure:** One or more smoke test cases fail. This indicates a potential issue that needs to be investigated and resolved before proceeding with further testing or deployment.\n\n## 8. Reporting\n\n*   Test results will be reported in a clear and concise manner, including:\n    *   Test case ID and description\n    *   Status (Pass/Fail)\n    *   Detailed error messages (if applicable)\n    *   Screenshots (if applicable)\n```"
