  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: WordPress.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis:\n\nWordPress.com is a website creation and hosting platform. Its core business functions revolve around enabling users to create, manage, and publish websites. The platform offers various features, including website templates, content management tools, hosting services, and domain registration.\n\n**Business Criticality:** While not a direct e-commerce platform, WordPress.com's availability and functionality are crucial for its users' online presence. Outages or critical bugs can lead to significant disruption for users, impacting their businesses and reputations.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Downtime can lead to lost revenue for users who rely on WordPress.com for their online businesses.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** System failures can damage WordPress.com's reputation and erode user trust.\n*   **Data Integrity:** Although this smoke test doesn't focus on data manipulation, any underlying issues that could potentially lead to data corruption are a concern.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** While not the primary focus of this smoke test, identifying critical security vulnerabilities during the initial health check is essential.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope:\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Verification of website availability and basic functionality.\n*   Successful loading of the homepage and key landing pages.\n*   Identification and verification of the presence of critical UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   Basic navigation to key areas of the site (e.g., Login, Signup/Get Started, Pricing).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed functional testing of all features.\n*   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing (beyond basic availability).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (beyond a single, primary browser).\n*   Mobile testing.\n*   Database integrity checks.\n*   API testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity):\n\nThe smoke suite will focus on verifying the core functionality and availability of WordPress.com.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the WordPress.com homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **Login Page Load:** Verify the Login page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    3.  **Signup/Get Started Page Load:** Verify the Signup/Get Started page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    4.  **\"Try for Free\" Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button is present on the homepage.\n    5.  **Button Presence (Generic):** Verify the presence of 4 other buttons (any button).\n    6.  **Link Presence (Generic):** Verify the presence of 2 links (any link).\n    7.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of 2 menu bars.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite:\n\n*   **Note:** This is a smoke test strategy. A full regression strategy will be defined separately. However, the following points are important to consider for future regression testing:\n    *   **Functional Testing:** Comprehensive testing of all features, including website creation, content management, and hosting services.\n    *   **Negative Testing:** Testing error handling and input validation.\n    *   **Performance Testing:** Load testing and stress testing to ensure the platform can handle peak traffic.\n    *   **Security Testing:** Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to identify and address security risks.\n    *   **Cross-Browser and Device Compatibility:** Testing across different browsers, operating systems, and devices.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy:\n\n*   For the smoke test, static data is sufficient. No dynamic data generation is required.\n*   For future regression testing, a combination of static and dynamic data will be necessary. Consider using a test data management tool to generate and manage test data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation:\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommend using the Page Object Model design pattern. This will improve code maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the WordPress.com website should be represented as a Page Object, encapsulating the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically recover from common test failures, such as element locators that have changed.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets:\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage (https://wordpress.com):** Focus on identifying buttons, links, and menu bars.\n2.  **Login Page (https://wordpress.com/log-in/):** Verify page load and presence of login form elements.\n3.  **Signup/Get Started Page (Likely a subpage, e.g., https://wordpress.com/start/):** Verify page load and presence of signup form elements.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria:\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP status code 200 OK for all page loads.\n    *   Presence of the specified UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars) on the target pages.\n    *   No critical JavaScript errors on the console.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP status code other than 200 OK.\n    *   Missing UI elements.\n    *   Critical JavaScript errors on the console.\n    *   Exceptions during page load."
