  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document for CareerRaah.com, tailored for your specific requirements. This document provides a comprehensive plan to ensure the quality and reliability of the application, focusing on a risk-based approach, a solid testing strategy, architectural guidance, and clear execution instructions.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: CareerRaah.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://www.careerraah.com/\n**Business Domain:** Education\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nCareerRaah.com operates in the education domain, providing career counseling and program exploration services. The core business functions revolve around:\n\n*   **User Acquisition:** Attracting potential students/clients to the platform.\n*   **Information Delivery:** Providing accurate and relevant information about careers and programs.\n*   **Lead Generation:** Converting website visitors into leads for career counseling services.\n*   **Service Delivery:** Providing career counseling services.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nSystem failures on CareerRaah.com can lead to the following risks:\n\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative impact on brand image and user trust due to website unavailability or incorrect information.\n*   **Loss of Potential Leads:** Inability to capture leads for career counseling services, resulting in revenue loss.\n*   **Incorrect Information Dissemination:** Providing inaccurate or outdated career information, leading to poor decision-making by users.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Exposure of user data, leading to privacy breaches and legal liabilities.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Smoke Tests:** Verification of core website functionality and availability, including:\n    *   Homepage loading and content display.\n    *   Navigation to key sections (Career Counseling, Explore Programs).\n*   **Functional Tests:** Testing the functionality of website elements.\n*   **UI Tests:** Ensuring the UI elements are properly displayed.\n\n**Out of Scope (For this initial Smoke Test Strategy):**\n\n*   Detailed form submissions and data processing.\n*   Payment gateway integrations.\n*   User account management and personalization features.\n*   Third-party integrations.\n*   Performance and security testing (addressed in later phases).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will serve as the initial \"health check\" to ensure the website is operational and core features are accessible.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the CareerRaah.com homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 status) and displays the main heading.\n    2.  **Navigation - Career Counseling (If Available):**  Verify the \"Career Counseling\" link (if present) is clickable and navigates to the corresponding page.\n    3.  **Navigation - Explore Programs (If Available):**  Verify the \"Explore Programs\" link (if present) is clickable and navigates to the corresponding page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Future Phases)\n\nThis section outlines the plan for the Regression Suite, which will be implemented in later phases.  It involves more thorough testing and more complex test cases.\n\n*   **Focus Areas:**\n    *   All functionalities and components outlined in the functional requirements document.\n    *   End-to-end user flows, such as lead generation and inquiry submission.\n    *   Integration points with third-party systems.\n    *   Data validation and integrity checks.\n*   **Test Case Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize test cases based on risk and business impact.\n    *   Focus on critical functionalities and high-traffic areas.\n*   **Types of Regression Tests:**\n    *   **Functional Regression:** Validating that existing functionality continues to work as expected after changes.\n    *   **Integration Regression:** Ensuring that integrations with external systems remain functional.\n    *   **UI Regression:** Verifying that UI elements and layouts are consistent and visually appealing.\n    *   **Data Regression:** Ensuring that data is stored, retrieved, and processed correctly.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:**  Initially, the smoke tests will use static data (e.g., verifying text visibility).  As the Regression Suite matures, we'll transition to a hybrid approach:\n    *   **Static Data:** For simple validations and UI checks.\n    *   **Dynamic Data Generation:**  Using libraries like Faker to generate realistic data for form submissions and data-driven testing.  This reduces test data maintenance overhead.\n*   **Data Storage:** Test data will be stored in CSV files or a dedicated database for easy management and updates.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability. Each web page will be represented as a class, with its elements and actions defined as methods.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Mitigation:**\n    *   **Explicit Waits:**  Use `WebDriverWait` with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous loading of elements.\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Implement retry mechanisms with short intervals to verify conditions that may take time to become true.  (e.g., checking for an element to become visible after a JavaScript animation).\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques where the test framework can automatically locate elements even if their locators change slightly. (This will require a more advanced framework and is not recommended for the initial smoke tests).\n*   **Test Environment Stability:**\n    *   Ensure a stable test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.\n    *   Establish clear procedures for environment setup and maintenance.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (For the Autonomous Agent / Initial Exploration)\n\nGiven the initial scope, the autonomous agent should prioritize the following:\n\n1.  **Homepage:**  Start with the root URL (https://www.careerraah.com/).\n2.  **\"Career Counseling\" Link (If Present):** Locate and click this link.\n3.  **\"Explore Programs\" Link (If Present):** Locate and click this link.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Criteria (Homepage):**\n    *   HTTP Response Code: 200 OK.\n    *   Main Heading Visibility:  The primary heading element (e.g., `<h1>` or `<h2>` containing the website's name or a welcome message) is visible on the page.\n*   **Success Criteria (Navigation Links):**\n    *   Clickability: The \"Career Counseling\" and \"Explore Programs\" links are clickable without errors.\n    *   Page Load: Clicking the links navigates to a new page with a valid HTTP 200 OK response.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing CareerRaah.com. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the quality, reliability, and security of the application."
