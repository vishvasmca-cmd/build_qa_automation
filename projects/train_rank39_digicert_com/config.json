It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the website.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** DigiCert.com is a website for a Certificate Authority (CA). Its business criticality stems from providing secure digital certificates for online security and trust. Failure to access the website or key features can lead to significant business disruption for DigiCert and its customers.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Inability to access the website or core features (Login, Signup) results in immediate loss of potential business, damage to reputation, and potential security vulnerabilities.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Verification of element presence (not functionality).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Detailed functionality of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing beyond basic accessibility.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the DigiCert.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   Login button/link\n            *   Signup/GetStarted button/link (or similar)\n            *   \"Try for Free\" button/link (or similar)\n            *   5 additional buttons (any buttons on the homepage)\n            *   2 links (any links on the homepage)\n            *   2 menu bars (navigation menus)\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for Smoke Testing. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** While this is a smoke test, implementing a basic POM structure will provide a foundation for future, more comprehensive testing. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators for the elements being verified.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible()`) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for initial page load failures.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to capture and report any exceptions during test execution.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://digicert.com):** This is the primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 (OK)\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"DigiCert\" (or a relevant keyword)\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   Element Presence: Each specified element (Login, Signup, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) is present on the page.\n        *   Element Visibility: Each element is visible on the page (not hidden by CSS or other means).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for Smoke Testing DigiCert.com. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the website's core functionality is verified effectively and efficiently."
