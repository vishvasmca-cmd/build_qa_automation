  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: DomainControl.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing DomainControl.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the website.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** DomainControl.com is a website focused on domain registration and management. Its business criticality lies in ensuring users can access the site, navigate to key areas, and initiate account creation or login processes. Failure to do so impacts user acquisition and revenue generation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core navigation and access features can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Potential Customers:** Users unable to access the site or find key actions (login, signup) will likely abandon the platform.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the brand and erodes user trust.\n    *   **Reduced Revenue:** Inability to acquire new customers directly impacts revenue streams.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Basic page load and element rendering.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of each button/link (e.g., actual login process, signup form submission).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the DomainControl.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar account creation button is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Additional 2):** Verify the presence and visibility of two other prominent buttons on the homepage (e.g., \"Search Domains,\" \"Learn More\").\n        6.  **Link Presence (2):** Verify the presence and visibility of two links on the homepage (e.g., \"Help,\" \"Contact Us\").\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Verify the presence and visibility of two menu bars on the homepage (e.g., \"Products,\" \"Resources\").\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for smoke testing.*  A regression suite will be defined later, focusing on deeper functionality and edge cases.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** While a full Page Object Model (POM) might be overkill for a simple smoke test, consider a lightweight POM approach. Create page objects for the homepage, encapsulating locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars. This will improve maintainability as the application evolves.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., waiting for an element to be visible) to handle potential timing issues during page load. This prevents false failures due to elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial website launch test. If the site fails to load on the first attempt, retry a few times before failing the test. This can mitigate transient network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and successful rendering of the homepage content.\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** Each button, link, and menu bar must be visible on the page.  Visibility can be verified using appropriate Selenium methods (e.g., `isDisplayed()`).\n    *   **Text Verification (Optional):** While not strictly required for smoke, verifying the text content of the buttons/links adds an extra layer of confidence (e.g., verifying the \"Login\" button actually says \"Login\").\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for smoke testing DomainControl.com. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure a robust and reliable testing process, minimizing the risk of critical issues impacting users."
