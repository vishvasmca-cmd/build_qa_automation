  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: GitHub (Smoke Test)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for the GitHub website, specifically focusing on a smoke test suite. The purpose of this plan is to provide clear instructions to autonomous agents regarding site mining, verification points, and structural guidelines for the automated test suite.\n\n**Target URL:** https://github.com\n**Business Domain:** SaaS\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n**User Goal:** Navigate to GitHub homepage. Verify the hero headline contains 'Build, ship, and maintain software'. Find and click the 'Sign Up' button.\n\n## 2. Domain Information\n\nGitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration. It is primarily used for software development, offering features such as:\n\n*   **Version Control:** Git repository hosting.\n*   **Collaboration:** Issue tracking, pull requests, code review.\n*   **Project Management:** Kanban boards, milestones.\n*   **Community:** Open-source project hosting, developer profiles.\n\n**Based on the domain, the agent should understand:**\n\n*   Critical functionality revolves around user authentication, repository management, and collaborative coding workflows.\n*   Performance and reliability are paramount, as developers rely on the platform for their daily work.\n*   UI stability is also essential for efficient navigation and interaction.\n\n## 3. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe Smoke Suite is designed to quickly verify the essential functionality of GitHub. It focuses on core navigation, basic site availability, and a single \"happy path\" user flow.\n\n### 3.1. Test Suite Objectives\n\n*   Verify the GitHub website is accessible and responsive.\n*   Ensure core navigation elements are functional.\n*   Validate the primary user goal of reaching the GitHub homepage, verifying key text, and initiating the sign-up process.\n\n### 3.2. Test Cases\n\n1.  **Site Availability:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the GitHub homepage loads successfully with a 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://github.com\n        2.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200.\n        3.  Verify the page title contains \"GitHub\".\n    *   **Expected Result:** The GitHub homepage loads successfully, returning a 200 OK status code and the correct title.\n\n2.  **Core Navigation:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the main navigation links are present and functional.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://github.com\n        2.  Identify the main navigation menu (e.g., using `nav` element with a specific class or ID).\n        3.  Verify that the following links are present and point to valid URLs (check for 200 status when following):\n            *   \"Product\"\n            *   \"Solutions\"\n            *   \"Open Source\"\n            *   \"Pricing\"\n    *   **Expected Result:** All specified navigation links are present and lead to functional pages.\n\n3.  **Happy Path: Homepage Headline & Sign Up Button:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the hero headline text and the functionality of the 'Sign Up' button on the homepage.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://github.com\n        2.  Locate the main headline element (e.g., using an `h1` tag with a specific class or ID).\n        3.  Verify the headline text contains \"Build, ship, and maintain software\".\n        4.  Locate the \"Sign Up\" button (e.g., using an `a` or `button` element with text \"Sign up\" or a relevant class/ID).\n        5.  Click the \"Sign Up\" button.\n        6.  Verify that clicking the button navigates to the sign-up page (URL contains \"/signup\").\n    *   **Expected Result:** The headline text is correct, the \"Sign Up\" button is clickable, and clicking it leads to the sign-up page.\n\n## 4. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nTo optimize the autonomous agent's mining and testing efforts, prioritize the following:\n\n*   **Homepage Structure:** Focus on mining the structure of the homepage, specifically the header (navigation), the main content area (hero section), and footer.\n*   **Navigation Elements:**  Specifically look for `<nav>` elements with `id` or `class` attributes like \"main-nav\", \"header-nav\", etc. Extract all `<a>` tags within these elements, focusing on the `href` attribute.\n*   **Headline Element:** Identify the main headline using tags like `<h1>`, `<h2>` and look for unique attributes. Check the text content of the element.\n*   **Button Elements:** Scan for `<button>` or `<a>` elements with text content containing \"Sign Up\", \"Register\", or similar terms related to account creation.  Also, look for common button classes like \"btn\", \"button\", \"primary-button\". Extract their `href` attributes or click event handlers.\n*   **Prioritize HTML Elements with Semantic Meaning:**  Give preference to elements with semantic HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` to better understand the site's structure.\n*   **CSS Selectors:** Use CSS selectors (e.g., `h1.hero-title`, `a.btn.btn-primary`) to precisely locate elements, particularly for headline and button identification.\n\n## 5. Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:** Platform-independent (should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n## 6. Reporting\n\nThe autonomous agent should generate a clear and concise report, including:\n\n*   Test case execution status (Pass/Fail)\n*   Error messages (if any)\n*   Screenshots of failed test cases\n*   Execution time for each test case\n\n## 7. Success Criteria\n\nThe Smoke Suite is considered successful if all test cases pass, indicating that the core functionality of GitHub is operational."
