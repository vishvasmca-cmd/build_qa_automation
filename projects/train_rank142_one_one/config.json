  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: One.One Website - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the One.One website (https://one.one). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The One.One website falls under the \"general_web\" domain. While the specific business model is unknown, we can assume it's a standard web application aiming to provide information or services to users.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or core elements to function can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of potential users/customers:** If the site is down or key features are broken, users will likely go elsewhere.\n    *   **Damage to brand reputation:** A buggy or unreliable website can negatively impact the perception of the company.\n    *   **Loss of revenue (if applicable):** If the website is used for sales or lead generation, downtime directly impacts revenue.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page loading.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar) buttons.\n        *   Identification of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed functionality of any specific feature.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Mobile device testing (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):** This suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure the website is fundamentally operational.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website (https://one.one) loads successfully and returns an HTTP 200 status code.\n        2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements on the homepage:\n            *   At least one button with text containing \"Login\" (or similar).\n            *   At least one button with text containing \"Signup\", \"Get Started\", or similar onboarding phrases.\n            *   At least one button with text containing \"Try for Free\" (or similar).\n            *   At least 2 distinct links (identified by `<a>` tags with `href` attributes).\n            *   At least 2 distinct menu bars (identified by common menu HTML structures like `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`).\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for smoke testing.* A regression suite will be defined later to cover deeper functionality and edge cases.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** While a full Page Object Model (POM) might be overkill for this simple smoke test, consider creating a basic `HomePage` class to encapsulate the element locators. This will make the tests more maintainable as the website evolves.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to check for element presence. This helps avoid false failures due to slow page load times.  Example:  \"Wait up to 5 seconds for the 'Login' button to appear.\"\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire smoke test suite. If the suite fails on the first run, retry it once or twice before failing the build. This can help mitigate transient network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage (https://one.one):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code is returned.\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   The specified buttons and links are present on the page.\n        *   The text content of the buttons matches the expected values (e.g., \"Login\", \"Signup\").\n        *   The links have valid `href` attributes.\n        *   The menu bars are present and appear to be correctly structured.\n*   **Reporting:**  Clearly report any failures, including the specific element that could not be found or the HTTP status code received.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the One.One website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure that the website is fundamentally operational and ready for further testing and development."
