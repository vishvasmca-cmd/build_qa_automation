  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. I need to craft a Master Test Strategy for the login functionality of \"https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login\". This strategy will guide the entire engineering team, focusing on regression testing and setting the stage for future automation efforts.\n\nHere's the Master Test Strategy document:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Login Functionality - the-internet.herokuapp.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login\n**Business Domain:** General Web Application (Login Functionality)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe target application provides a simple login page. While seemingly basic, login functionality is a critical entry point for any application. Failure here prevents access to all subsequent features.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Impact of Failure:** Inability to access the application, potentially blocking users from intended tasks. While this is a demo site, the principles apply to real-world scenarios where login failures can lead to lost productivity, revenue, or even security breaches.\n*   **Risk Areas:**\n    *   Authentication failures (incorrect credentials).\n    *   Authorization issues (accessing unauthorized areas after login).\n    *   Security vulnerabilities (e.g., brute-force attacks, credential stuffing).\n    *   Session management problems (e.g., session timeouts, hijacking).\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Positive login scenarios (valid credentials).\n    *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials, missing fields).\n    *   Error message validation.\n    *   Session management (timeout, logout).\n    *   Basic security checks (input validation).\n    *   Accessibility (basic checks).\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Performance testing (load, stress).\n    *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n    *   Integration with other systems (as this is a standalone login page).\n    *   Detailed accessibility compliance (WCAG).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will verify the most basic functionality to ensure the login page is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to the login page.\n    2.  Enter valid username (\"tomsmith\") and password (\"SuperSecretPassword!\").\n    3.  Click the \"Login\" button.\n    4.  Verify successful login (e.g., presence of a \"Welcome\" message or a specific element on the next page).\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will cover a wider range of scenarios to ensure existing functionality remains intact after changes.\n\n*   **Positive Testing:**\n    1.  Login with valid credentials (tomsmith/SuperSecretPassword!).\n    2.  Verify successful login and redirection to the expected page.\n    3.  Verify session persistence (stay logged in for a reasonable time).\n    4.  Logout successfully.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    1.  Login with invalid username.\n    2.  Login with invalid password.\n    3.  Login with empty username.\n    4.  Login with empty password.\n    5.  Login with special characters in username/password (e.g., SQL injection attempts).\n    6.  Login with leading/trailing spaces in username/password.\n    7.  Attempt to access a protected page without logging in (verify redirection to login).\n    8.  Attempt to login with a locked-out account (if applicable).\n    9.  Attempt to login with expired password (if applicable).\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    1.  Simultaneous login attempts from multiple browsers/devices.\n    2.  Login after a long period of inactivity.\n    3.  Login with extremely long username/password (boundary testing).\n    4.  Login with different browser versions/types.\n    5.  Login with Javascript disabled (if applicable).\n\n*   **Security Testing (Basic):**\n    1.  Inspect network traffic for sensitive data transmitted in plain text (HTTPS is expected).\n    2.  Check for basic input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Static Data:** For basic positive and negative tests, use hardcoded values (e.g., \"tomsmith\", \"SuperSecretPassword!\").\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** For boundary testing (e.g., long usernames/passwords), generate data programmatically.\n    *   **Data Storage:** Store credentials securely (e.g., in environment variables or a dedicated configuration file).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM). This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   Create a `LoginPage` class with methods for entering username, password, clicking the login button, and retrieving error messages.\n    *   Create a `SecureAreaPage` class to represent the page after successful login.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with explicit waits) to handle asynchronous operations and potential delays in UI updates.  Avoid hardcoded waits.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically locate elements even if their locators change slightly (e.g., using relative locators or multiple locator strategies).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement retry logic for flaky tests (e.g., network issues).  Limit the number of retries to avoid masking genuine failures.\n    *   **Centralized Configuration:** Store locators and other configuration data in a central location (e.g., a configuration file) to facilitate easy updates.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  `/login` page: Focus on all input fields (username, password) and the login button.\n    2.  The page displayed after successful login (to verify successful redirection).\n    3.  Error messages displayed after failed login attempts.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Successful Login:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code after submitting the form.\n        *   Redirection to the expected page (e.g., `/secure`).\n        *   Presence of a \"Welcome\" message or a specific element on the target page.\n    *   **Failed Login:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code (the page should reload).\n        *   Display of an appropriate error message (e.g., \"Invalid username/password\").\n        *   The user remains on the `/login` page.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   All communication over HTTPS.\n        *   No sensitive data transmitted in plain text.\n        *   Input validation prevents basic SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the login functionality of the target application. It emphasizes risk assessment, a well-defined testing scope, and clear guidance for the test architecture and execution. This document will be a living document and will be updated as needed.\n```\n"
