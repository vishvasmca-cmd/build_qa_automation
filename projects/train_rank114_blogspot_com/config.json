  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Blogspot.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing Blogspot.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Blogspot.com is a blogging platform. While not directly transactional (e.g., e-commerce), its availability and core features are crucial for user engagement and content creation. Failure can lead to user frustration, content loss, and damage to the platform's reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **Medium Risk:** System failures can lead to user dissatisfaction and potential loss of content.\n    *   **Impact:** Primarily affects user experience and platform reputation.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of login, signup, or other features.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid credentials).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited to a primary browser).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and the essential UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to `https://blogspot.com` and verify the page loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is visible on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar button is visible on the page.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar button is visible on the page.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Additional 2):** Identify and verify the presence of two more distinct buttons on the page.\n        6.  **Link Presence (2):** Identify and verify the presence of two distinct links on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Identify and verify the presence of two distinct menu bars on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke testing. A simple Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended for maintainability.\n    *   **Page Objects:** Create a `HomePage` object containing locators for the target UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for element to be visible) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Timeout:** Implement reasonable timeouts for element visibility checks.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://blogspot.com`):** Focus on the initial page load and identifying the target UI elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code and page title contains \"Blogger\".\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are visible on the page within a reasonable timeout (e.g., 10 seconds).\n    *   **Success:** All verification criteria are met.\n    *   **Failure:** Any verification criteria are not met.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing Blogspot.com. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality of the application is verified effectively and efficiently."
