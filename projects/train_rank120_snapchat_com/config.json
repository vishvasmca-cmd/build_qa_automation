  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Snapchat Website Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSnapchat is a social media platform. Website availability and basic functionality are crucial for user acquisition and brand reputation. Failure in these areas can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Potential Users:** Inability to sign up or access the website directly impacts user growth.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Website outages or critical errors erode user trust and brand image.\n*   **Reduced Engagement:** Difficulty in accessing key features can decrease user engagement.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nThe primary risks associated with the Snapchat website include:\n\n*   **Availability:** Website is down or inaccessible.\n*   **Critical Functionality Failure:** Key elements like login, signup, and navigation are broken.\n*   **UI Rendering Issues:** Elements are not displayed correctly, impacting user experience.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Website launch and accessibility.\n*   Identification of key UI elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, \"Try for Free\" (or similar call-to-action), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n*   Verification of element presence and basic attributes (e.g., text, visibility).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed functionality of each button, link, or menu item.\n*   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n*   Performance testing (e.g., page load times).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited to a single, primary browser - e.g., Chrome).\n*   Mobile device testing.\n*   API testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThis suite focuses on verifying the core health of the Snapchat website.\n\n**Test Cases:**\n\n1.  **Website Launch:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the Snapchat website loads successfully.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://snapchat.com`.\n        2.  Verify the page loads without errors.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Website loads successfully with a 200 HTTP status code.\n\n2.  **Login Button Presence:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://snapchat.com`.\n        2.  Locate the \"Login\" button.\n    *   **Expected Result:** \"Login\" button is present and visible on the page.\n\n3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button (or equivalent) is present and visible.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://snapchat.com`.\n        2.  Locate the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button.\n    *   **Expected Result:** \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible on the page.\n\n4.  **\"Try for Free\" (or equivalent) Button Presence:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar call-to-action button is present and visible.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://snapchat.com`.\n        2.  Locate the \"Try for Free\" button.\n    *   **Expected Result:** \"Try for Free\" button is present and visible on the page.\n\n5.  **Additional Buttons Presence (3 more):**\n    *   **Description:** Verify 3 other buttons are present and visible.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://snapchat.com`.\n        2.  Locate 3 other buttons.\n    *   **Expected Result:** 3 other buttons are present and visible on the page.\n\n6.  **Link Presence (2):**\n    *   **Description:** Verify 2 links are present and visible.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://snapchat.com`.\n        2.  Locate 2 links.\n    *   **Expected Result:** 2 links are present and visible on the page.\n\n7.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):**\n    *   **Description:** Verify 2 menu bars are present and visible.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://snapchat.com`.\n        2.  Locate 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Expected Result:** 2 menu bars are present and visible on the page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*N/A - This is a smoke test strategy.*\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create page objects for the main Snapchat website page. This will encapsulate the locators and actions related to the UI elements.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for elements to load.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test failures due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).  Limit retries to a maximum of 2-3.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should focus on the following areas *first*:\n\n*   **Homepage (`https://snapchat.com`):** This is the primary target for identifying the required UI elements.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   Website loads with an HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   All specified UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, \"Try for Free\", 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present and visible on the page.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   Website fails to load (HTTP status code other than 200).\n    *   Any of the specified UI elements are missing or not visible."
