  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Snapchat Website - Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Snapchat.com serves as the primary marketing and informational website for the Snapchat application. While not directly revenue-generating, it's crucial for user acquisition, brand reputation, and providing essential information.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failure of the website can lead to:\n    *   **Reduced User Acquisition**: Potential users unable to find information or sign up.\n    *   **Brand Damage**: A non-functional website reflects poorly on the Snapchat brand.\n    *   **Increased Support Costs**: Users may contact support for information readily available on the website.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website availability and basic functionality.\n        *   Loading of key pages (Homepage).\n        *   Presence and visibility of critical elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, key links, menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed functionality of the Snapchat application itself.\n        *   In-depth testing of every link and button.\n        *   Performance testing (beyond basic load time).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (separate testing phase).\n        *   Error handling and negative scenarios.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the website is up and running, and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Homepage Load**: Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Element Visibility**: Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   Login button\n            *   Signup/Get Started button\n            *   \"Try for Free\" (or similar call-to-action) button\n            *   Two additional buttons (any prominent buttons on the homepage)\n            *   Two key links (e.g., \"Privacy Policy\", \"Terms of Service\")\n            *   Two menu bars (verify they are present and visible)\n    *   **Data Strategy**:\n        *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test. We are primarily verifying the presence of elements, not their functionality.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent the Snapchat homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   `HomePage`: Page object representing the Snapchat homepage. Contains methods to:\n            *   Verify page load success.\n            *   Check for the presence of specific buttons and links.\n            *   Interact with menu bars (if needed in future tests).\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions to check for the presence of elements. This allows for slight delays in element loading, reducing flakiness.  Example: Instead of `Assert.IsTrue(loginButton.Displayed)`, use `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).Until(ExpectedConditions.ElementIsVisible(By.Id(\"loginButtonId\")))`.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Snapchat Homepage (https://snapchat.com)**: This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Homepage Load Success**: HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence**: Each specified button, link, and menu bar must be present and visible on the page.  Visibility is defined as being rendered in the DOM and not hidden by CSS (e.g., `display: none`).\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   A clear \"Pass/Fail\" status for each test case.\n    *   Screenshots of the homepage in case of failure.\n    *   Detailed error messages if elements are not found."
