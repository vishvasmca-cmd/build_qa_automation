  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Ad Traffic Quality Website - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Ad Traffic Quality website (https://adtrafficquality.google). This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable automated testing framework.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The Ad Traffic Quality website likely provides information and services related to ad traffic quality measurement and improvement. Failure of this website could lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** If users cannot access information or services, it reflects poorly on Google.\n    *   **Loss of Trust:** Inaccurate or unavailable information could erode user trust in Google's ad traffic quality solutions.\n    *   **Missed Opportunities:** Potential customers may be unable to learn about and adopt Google's solutions.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Medium. While not directly revenue-generating, the website plays a crucial role in educating and attracting customers.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence and basic functionality (page loading) of these elements.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of any buttons, links, or menu items (no clicking).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To ensure the website is up and running and that key elements are present and accessible.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar button is present.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar button is present.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Additional 2):** Identify and verify the presence of two more prominent buttons on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Presence (2):** Identify and verify the presence of two prominent links on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Identify and verify the presence of two menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for initial smoke testing. Regression tests will be defined after the initial smoke tests are stable and the application evolves.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for the initial smoke tests, as we are only verifying the presence of elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the website as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   **Technology Stack:** Recommend using a robust and widely adopted technology stack such as:\n        *   **Language:** Python or Java\n        *   **Testing Framework:** Pytest or JUnit\n        *   **Browser Automation:** Selenium WebDriver or Playwright\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_until_element_is_present`) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future):** Explore self-healing capabilities in the future to automatically recover from minor UI changes.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://adtrafficquality.google):** Focus on identifying the required buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page and visible in the DOM.\n    *   **No Exceptions:** The test execution should not throw any exceptions (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for smoke testing the Ad Traffic Quality website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the website is stable and accessible, providing a solid foundation for future development and testing efforts."
