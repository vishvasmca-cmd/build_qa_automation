  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Ad Traffic Quality Website - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the Ad Traffic Quality website (https://adtrafficquality.google) smoke testing. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The Ad Traffic Quality website likely provides information and services related to ad traffic quality measurement and improvement. Its business criticality is moderate, as failures could impact user trust and potentially lead to inaccurate ad traffic analysis.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website's core functionality (e.g., inability to access the site, login issues) can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Users may lose trust in the accuracy and reliability of Google's ad traffic quality services.\n    *   **Lost Opportunities:** Potential customers may be unable to learn about and utilize the services offered.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Detailed functionality of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n        2.  **Login Element:** Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Element:** Verify the \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar call-to-action button/link is present.\n        4.  **Button Verification (5):** Verify the presence of 5 distinct buttons on the page.\n        5.  **Link Verification (2):** Verify the presence of 2 distinct links on the page.\n        6.  **Menu Bar Verification (2):** Verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bars on the page.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on element presence rather than data input.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the website as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java` (contains elements and methods related to the homepage)\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential loading delays. This will prevent false failures due to elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Example:** Wait for the Login button to be present before asserting its existence.\n    *   **Element Existence Check:** Before interacting with an element, explicitly check if it exists on the page to avoid `NoSuchElementException`.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** The primary focus should be on the homepage (https://adtrafficquality.google) to identify the required elements.\n    2.  **Header/Footer:** Inspect the header and footer sections for login/signup links, menu bars, and other buttons/links.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present on the page.\n    *   **Success:** All verification criteria are met. If any criterion fails, the smoke test fails, and the build should be rejected.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Ad Traffic Quality website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality is verified effectively, minimizing the risk of critical failures in production."
