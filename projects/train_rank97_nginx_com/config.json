  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Nginx.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for smoke testing the Nginx.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the site.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Nginx.com is a website for a company providing web server, reverse proxy, load balancing, and media streaming solutions. Its business criticality lies in providing information about its products and services, enabling user acquisition (sign-ups, free trials), and maintaining brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of potential customers:** Inability to access information or sign up for services.\n    *   **Damage to brand reputation:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the company's technical capabilities.\n    *   **Reduced user engagement:** Frustration and abandonment of the site.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Existence and visibility of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Basic page load functionality (HTTP 200 OK).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the buttons, links, and menu bars (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially, focus on desktop).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Launch & Basic Elements**\n        *   **Description:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to `https://nginx.com`.\n            2.  Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n            3.  Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n            4.  Verify the presence of a \"Signup/Get Started\" button/link (or similar).\n            5.  Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" button/link (or similar).\n            6.  Verify the presence of 5 distinct buttons.\n            7.  Verify the presence of 2 distinct links.\n            8.  Verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bars.\n        *   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully, and all specified elements are present and visible.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing. Smoke tests are designed to be fast and minimal.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on element presence and basic page load.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** While this is a smoke test and doesn't require a full-fledged framework, using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended for maintainability, even at this early stage.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` class that encapsulates the locators for the \"Login\", \"Signup\", \"Try for Free\" buttons/links, other buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** If elements are slow to load, use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be present for a maximum of 5 seconds).  This helps avoid false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire test case in case of temporary network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://nginx.com`):** This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200 OK is returned when accessing the homepage.\n        *   All specified elements (\"Login\", \"Signup/Get Started\", \"Try for Free\", 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present and visible on the page.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   HTTP status code other than 200 OK.\n        *   Any of the specified elements are missing or not visible."
