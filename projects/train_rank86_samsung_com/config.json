  "master_plan": "# Samsung.com - Master Test Strategy (Smoke Testing)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the Samsung.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Samsung.com is a high-traffic e-commerce and informational website. Failure can result in lost sales, brand damage, and customer frustration.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. Website unavailability or critical functionality failure directly impacts revenue and brand reputation.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature.\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Samsung.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements on the homepage:\n            *   Login button/link.\n            *   Signup/Get Started button/link.\n            *   At least 5 distinct buttons (excluding Login/Signup).\n            *   At least 2 distinct links (excluding Login/Signup).\n            *   At least 2 distinct menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability and scalability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` Page Object containing locators for all target elements (Login, Signup, buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays. This prevents false failures due to elements not being immediately visible.\n    *   **Locator Strategy:** Prioritize robust locators (e.g., using IDs or unique attributes) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 (OK)\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"Samsung\"\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   Element Presence: Each specified element (Login, Signup, buttons, links, menu bars) must be present on the page.  Use `driver.findElement()` or equivalent to confirm existence.\n        *   Element Visibility: Each element must be visible on the page (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()`).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for any failures, including screenshots and relevant log information."
