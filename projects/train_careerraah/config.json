  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan designed to guide autonomous agents in smoke testing Careerraah.com.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Careerraah.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://www.careerraah.com/\n**Business Domain:** Education\n**Testing Type:** Smoke Test\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the master test plan for performing a smoke test on Careerraah.com. The primary goals of this smoke test are to verify the website's basic availability, core functionality, and perform a preliminary security audit.  This plan will guide the autonomous agents in mining information, verifying key elements, and structuring the test suite.\n\n## 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\nCareerraah.com is an educational platform, presumably offering career guidance, resources, and potentially training or courses.  Based on the domain name, we can infer the following:\n\n*   **Target Audience:** Students, recent graduates, and professionals seeking career advancement.\n*   **Key Features (Hypothesized):**\n    *   Career assessment tools/quizzes\n    *   Job search or listing functionality\n    *   Educational resources (articles, guides, videos)\n    *   Course listings or training programs\n    *   User accounts/profiles\n    *   Blog or news section related to career advice\n    *   Contact/support features\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nThis smoke test will cover the following:\n\n*   Website availability and basic performance.\n*   Core navigation and menu links.\n*   A single, representative \"happy path\" user flow.\n*   Initial security header verification.\n\nOut-of-scope items for this initial smoke test include:\n\n*   In-depth testing of all features.\n*   Performance testing beyond basic load times.\n*   Detailed functional testing of specific modules.\n*   Full security penetration testing.\n\n## 4. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the following test cases:\n\n### 4.1. Website Availability\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** S001\n*   **Description:** Verify that the website is accessible and returns a 200 OK HTTP status code.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.careerraah.com/\n    2.  Verify that the page loads successfully.\n    3.  Verify HTTP status code is 200.\n*   **Expected Result:** The website should load within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., < 5 seconds) and return a 200 OK status.\n\n### 4.2. Core Navigation\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** S002\n*   **Description:** Verify that the main menu links are functional and navigate to the correct pages.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.careerraah.com/\n    2.  Identify the main menu items (e.g., \"About Us,\" \"Courses,\" \"Blog,\" \"Contact\").  *Autonomous agent should identify these dynamically*.\n    3.  Click each menu item.\n    4.  Verify that the corresponding page loads successfully.\n    5.  Verify that the URL changes to reflect the selected menu item.\n*   **Expected Result:** Each menu link should navigate to a relevant page without errors.\n\n### 4.3. Core Flow: Contact Form Submission (Happy Path)\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** S003\n*   **Description:** Verify the ability to submit a contact form.\n*   **Pre-requisites**: Must find a contact form available without login.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to the \"Contact\" page (Agent must find this link).\n    2.  Fill in all required fields in the contact form (e.g., name, email, message). Use valid, but generic data (e.g., \"Test User\", \"test@example.com\", \"This is a test message.\").\n    3.  Submit the form.\n    4.  Verify that a success message is displayed (e.g., \"Your message has been sent!\").\n*   **Expected Result:** The form should submit successfully, and a confirmation message should be displayed.\n\n## 5. Security Audit (Initial)\n\nThis section defines the initial security checks to be performed as part of the smoke test.\n\n### 5.1. Security Headers\n\n*   **Objective:** Verify the presence of critical security headers.\n*   **Headers to Check:**\n    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    *   **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):** Enforces HTTPS connections.\n    *   **X-Frame-Options:**  Protects against clickjacking attacks.\n    *   **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevents MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities.\n    *   **Referrer-Policy:** Controls how much referrer information is sent with requests.\n    *   **Permissions-Policy:** (Replaces Feature-Policy) Controls browser features.\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SEC001\n*   **Description:** Verify the presence and basic configuration of security headers.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to the homepage (https://www.careerraah.com/).\n    2.  Inspect the HTTP response headers. *The agent should automatically extract these.*\n    3.  Verify that the specified security headers are present.\n    4.  Report the value of each header.  (Further analysis of header values is beyond the scope of this *smoke* test but should be flagged for later, deeper analysis).\n*   **Expected Result:** All specified security headers should be present with reasonable values (e.g., HSTS with a sufficiently long `max-age`).\n\n### 5.2. SSL/TLS Configuration\n\n*   **Objective:** Verify that the website uses HTTPS and has a valid SSL/TLS certificate.\n*   **Test Case ID:** SEC002\n*   **Description:** Verify SSL/TLS configuration.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.careerraah.com/.\n    2.  Verify that the connection is secure (e.g., padlock icon in the browser).\n    3.  Inspect the SSL/TLS certificate. *Agent to use built-in tools to extract certificate information*.\n    4.  Verify that the certificate is valid and not expired.\n    5.  Verify the certificate is issued to Careerraah.com (or a wildcard covering the domain).\n*   **Expected Result:** The website should use a valid SSL/TLS certificate issued to the correct domain.\n\n### 5.3. Input Field Prioritization for Security Probing (Future Testing)\n\nBased on the domain and likely functionality, the following input fields should be prioritized for future security testing (e.g., fuzzing, input validation testing):\n\n*   **Contact Form Fields:** (Name, Email, Message) -  Especially the message field, as it could be vulnerable to XSS.\n*   **Search Fields:**  Any search functionality should be tested for SQL injection or XSS.\n*   **Login/Registration Forms:** (Username, Password, Email) - Standard security concerns apply (e.g., password complexity, account lockout).  *These are outside the scope of the initial smoke test if they require an account.*\n*   **Course Enrollment Forms:**  Any forms that collect payment information or sensitive personal data.  *Likely out of scope for a SMOKE test.*\n\n## 6. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize mining the following elements and pages:\n\n*   **Main Menu:** Extract all links in the main navigation menu.  Use semantic HTML (e.g., `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>`) to reliably identify the menu.\n*   **Footer:**  Extract links in the footer, as these often contain important information like \"About Us,\" \"Privacy Policy,\" and \"Terms of Service.\"\n*   **Contact Page:** Locate the contact form and identify all input fields (name, email, message, etc.) and the submit button.  Look for labels associated with the input fields.\n*   **Homepage Content:**  Extract the main heading (<h1>) and any prominent calls to action (e.g., buttons, links).\n*   **Sitemap (if available):** If a sitemap (e.g., `/sitemap.xml`) exists, use it to guide the agent in discovering more pages.\n\n## 7. Test Environment\n\n*   The tests should be executed in a clean environment (e.g., a Docker container or virtual machine) to ensure consistent results.\n*   The agent should use a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) with JavaScript enabled.\n\n## 8. Reporting\n\nThe autonomous agent should generate a detailed report including:\n\n*   Test case results (Pass/Fail).\n*   HTTP status codes for each page.\n*   Extracted security header values.\n*   SSL/TLS certificate information.\n*   Screenshots of any errors or failures.\n*   Execution time for each test case and the overall suite.\n\n## 9. Success Criteria\n\nThe smoke test is considered successful if:\n\n*   The website is accessible and returns a 200 OK status.\n*   All core navigation links function correctly.\n*   The contact form can be submitted successfully.\n*   All specified security headers are present.\n*   The website uses a valid SSL/TLS certificate.\n\n## 10. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the test suite to cover more features and user flows.\n*   Implement performance testing to measure website speed and scalability.\n*   Conduct thorough security penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.\n*   Add tests to verify accessibility (WCAG compliance)."
