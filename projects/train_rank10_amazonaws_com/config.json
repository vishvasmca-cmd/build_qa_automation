  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document for Amazon AWS website, focusing on the specified smoke test requirements.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Amazon AWS Website Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://amazonaws.com\n**Business Domain:** General Web (Cloud Services Platform)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nAmazon AWS is a critical cloud services platform. Website availability and accessibility are paramount for:\n\n*   **Customer Acquisition:** New users need to easily explore services and sign up.\n*   **Customer Retention:** Existing users need to access the console and documentation.\n*   **Brand Reputation:** A functional website builds trust and credibility.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the AWS website can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Potential Customers:** Inability to sign up or explore services.\n*   **Customer Frustration:** Difficulty accessing the console or documentation.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Perception of unreliability.\n*   **Financial Impact:** Reduced adoption of AWS services.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Website launch and basic page load.\n*   Identification of key elements on the homepage: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n*   Verification of the presence and visibility of these elements.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Clicking any buttons, links, or menu items.\n*   Form submission or data input.\n*   Detailed functionality of any AWS services.\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n*   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n*   Error handling (e.g., 404 pages).\n*   Security testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the following tests:\n\n1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the AWS homepage loads successfully.\n2.  **Login Element Check:** Verify the presence and visibility of a \"Login\" button or link.\n3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Check:** Verify the presence and visibility of a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button or link.\n4.  **Try for Free Element Check:** Verify the presence and visibility of a \"Try for Free\" button or link (or similar call to action).\n5.  **Button Count Check:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons on the homepage.\n6.  **Link Count Check:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n7.  **Menu Bar Count Check:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined separately.*\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** While this is a smoke test, using POM from the start will facilitate future expansion into regression testing. Create a `HomePage` object with methods to identify and verify the presence of the required elements.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to check for element visibility. This helps mitigate timing issues and ensures elements are fully loaded before verification.  Example:  Wait up to 5 seconds for the Login button to be visible.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire smoke test suite. If the suite fails, retry it once or twice before failing the build. This can help mitigate transient network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should focus on the following areas:\n\n*   **Homepage (https://amazonaws.com):** This is the primary target.\n*   **Header:** Inspect the header section for menu bars, login/signup links.\n*   **Body:** Scan the main body of the page for buttons and links related to getting started or trying AWS services.\n*   **Footer:** Check the footer for additional links and menu items.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Website Launch Success:** HTTP response code 200 (OK) and the presence of the `<title>` tag.\n*   **Element Presence:** The specified elements (Login, Signup, Try for Free, buttons, links, menu bars) must be present in the DOM and visible on the page. Visibility can be determined by checking CSS properties like `display` and `visibility`.\n*   **Count Verification:** The number of buttons, links, and menu bars must meet the minimum requirements (5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the smoke testing of the Amazon AWS website. It prioritizes critical functionality and sets the foundation for a robust testing framework."
