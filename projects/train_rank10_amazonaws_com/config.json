  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Amazon AWS Website (Smoke Testing)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Amazon AWS website (https://amazonaws.com). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The Amazon AWS website is a critical platform for cloud services, impacting a wide range of businesses and individuals. Availability and core functionality are paramount.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the AWS website can lead to significant financial losses for Amazon and its customers, damage to brand reputation, and potential disruption of critical services.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key elements on the homepage (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, etc.).\n        *   Identification of key links on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual AWS services.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic availability).\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Navigation beyond the homepage.\n        *   Negative testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially, focus on desktop).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the AWS website (https://amazonaws.com) loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\", \"Get Started\", or similar button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Additional 2):** Identify and verify the presence of two more distinct buttons on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Presence (2):** Identify and verify the presence of two distinct links on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Identify and verify the presence of two distinct menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for Smoke Testing)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Smoke Tests:** No specific test data is required for smoke tests, as we are only verifying the presence of elements.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n\n    *   Utilize a lightweight framework suitable for simple element verification. Consider Playwright or Selenium with a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars. This promotes maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions with reasonable timeouts to handle potential loading delays. For example, wait for an element to be visible before asserting its presence.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for website launch to handle transient network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n\n    1.  **Homepage (https://amazonaws.com):** Focus all exploration on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Element is visible and enabled (if applicable).\n    *   **No Exceptions:** No unhandled exceptions or errors during test execution.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed test cases.\n*   **Automation Priority:**\n    *   Automate the smoke test suite immediately. This will be the first line of defense for build verification.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Amazon AWS website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance."
