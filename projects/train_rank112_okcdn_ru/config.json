  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: okcdn.ru - Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** okcdn.ru appears to be a general web application. Without further context, we assume standard web application risks apply.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure to load the website or critical elements (login, signup) results in immediate user frustration and potential loss of new user acquisition. The risk is moderate, impacting initial user experience and brand perception.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website accessibility and load time.\n        *   Presence and visibility of specified UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Basic rendering of the page layout.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu items (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed UI element styling (fonts, colors, exact positioning).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing beyond initial load time.\n        *   Error handling (e.g., 404 pages).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Load & Basic Elements**\n        *   Navigate to `https://okcdn.ru`.\n        *   Verify the page loads within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        *   Verify the presence of the Login button/link.\n        *   Verify the presence of the Signup/GetStarted button/link (or equivalent).\n        *   Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" button/link (or equivalent).\n        *   Verify the presence of 5 distinct buttons.\n        *   Verify the presence of 2 distinct links.\n        *   Verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* This strategy focuses solely on the initial health check.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on UI element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** A lightweight framework is sufficient for this smoke test. Consider using Playwright, Selenium, or Cypress. A basic Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended, even for this simple test, to promote maintainability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` object containing locators for the Login, Signup, Try for Free buttons/links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitForElementToBeVisible`) to handle potential timing issues during page load. This prevents false failures due to elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial page load to handle transient network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** The homepage (`https://okcdn.ru`).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   The website loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n        *   The Login button/link is present and visible.\n        *   The Signup/GetStarted button/link (or equivalent) is present and visible.\n        *   The \"Try for Free\" button/link (or equivalent) is present and visible.\n        *   5 distinct buttons are present and visible.\n        *   2 distinct links are present and visible.\n        *   2 distinct menu bars are present and visible.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   The website fails to load (HTTP error code other than 200).\n        *   Any of the required UI elements are missing or not visible.\n*   **Reporting:** Any failure should be immediately reported and investigated. The build should be rejected if the smoke test fails."
