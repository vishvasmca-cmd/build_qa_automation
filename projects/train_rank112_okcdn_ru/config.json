  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: okcdn.ru - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the initial smoke testing phase of the okcdn.ru website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** okcdn.ru is categorized as a \"general_web\" domain. Without further information, we assume it's a content delivery network (CDN) or related service. The business criticality is moderate, as website availability and basic functionality are essential for user engagement and potential revenue generation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or critical elements to function can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Users may perceive the service as unreliable.\n    *   **Loss of Potential Customers:** If signup or trial options are broken, new user acquisition is hindered.\n    *   **Reduced User Engagement:** If core navigation is broken, existing users may be unable to access content or services.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website homepage load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar 5 buttons), 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Basic visual verification of these elements (e.g., they are visible and not obviously broken).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the buttons and links (i.e., clicking them).\n        *   Detailed visual testing (e.g., pixel-perfect comparisons).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited to the primary browser used for development).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the fundamental health of the okcdn.ru website.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the website homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar button is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar button is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify another button is present and visible.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify another button is present and visible.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a link is present and visible.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify a link is present and visible.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present and visible.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present and visible.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The tests primarily focus on element presence.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the homepage. Each key element (buttons, links, menu bars) should be represented as a property within the page object. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to check for the presence of elements. This accounts for potential loading delays. Example: `waitForElementVisible(loginButton, timeout=5)`\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions during element identification. Log errors with sufficient detail for debugging.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage Load:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the page.  Visibility should be determined by checking the element's `isDisplayed()` property.\n    *   **No Critical Errors:** No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   A clear pass/fail report should be generated after each smoke test execution.\n    *   Failed tests should include detailed error messages and screenshots.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for the smoke testing phase of okcdn.ru. It will be reviewed and updated as needed based on testing results and evolving requirements."
