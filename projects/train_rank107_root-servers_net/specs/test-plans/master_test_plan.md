# Test Plan: train_rank107_root-servers_net

## 1. Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the train_rank107_root-servers_net project. The primary goal is to ensure the basic functionality of the website, focusing on identifying key elements like buttons, links, and menu bars.

## 2. Scope

The testing will cover the following areas:

*   Website navigation
*   Identification of buttons
*   Identification of links

## 3. Testing Strategy

We will employ a combination of smoke and regression testing strategies.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite will focus on verifying the core functionality of the website. The following checklist will be applied:

1.  **Critical Paths:** Verify basic website navigation.
2.  **Core Business Logic:** N/A (No specific business logic identified in the trace).
3.  **Positive Testing:** Focus on successful identification of elements.
4.  **No Negative Testing:** No negative scenarios will be included in the smoke suite.
5.  **No Complex Edge Cases:** No complex scenarios will be included.
6.  **Minimal Test Data:** No test data is required for this smoke test.
7.  **Fast Execution:** The smoke suite should execute quickly.
8.  **Build Acceptance:** Passing the smoke suite is required for build acceptance.

### Regression Suite Strategy

The regression suite will cover a broader range of scenarios, including alternative flows, negative scenarios, and edge cases. (Not applicable based on the provided trace).

## 4. Test Environment

The tests will be executed in a standard web browser environment (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## 5. Test Deliverables

*   Test Plan
*   Gherkin feature files
*   Test execution reports

## 6. Test Schedule

The testing will be conducted according to the project schedule.
