  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Root Servers Website (Smoke Testing)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Root Servers website (https://root-servers.net). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The Root Servers website provides information about the DNS root name servers. While not a direct revenue-generating application, its availability and accuracy are crucial for the stability of the internet infrastructure. Failure can lead to widespread DNS resolution issues.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failure can result in:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust in the organization maintaining the root servers.\n    *   **Service Disruption:** Potential impact on DNS resolution, affecting internet accessibility.\n    *   **Informational Integrity:** Incorrect or outdated information can lead to misconfiguration and DNS problems.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic functionality.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual pages or features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Error handling and negative scenarios.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is up and running, and key navigation elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\", \"Get Started\", or similar button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Generic #4):** Verify any other button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        6.  **Button Presence (Generic #5):** Verify any other button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        7.  **Link Presence (Generic #1):** Verify any link is present and visible on the homepage.\n        8.  **Link Presence (Generic #2):** Verify any other link is present and visible on the homepage.\n        9.  **Menu Bar Presence (Generic #1):** Verify a menu bar is present and visible on the homepage.\n        10. **Menu Bar Presence (Generic #2):** Verify another menu bar is present and visible on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.*  Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for the smoke tests. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the website's pages and elements. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class containing locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Example:** `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.LINK_TEXT, \"Login\")))`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage (https://root-servers.net):** Focus the autonomous agent on the homepage to identify the required buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Availability:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the page.  Visibility means the element is rendered and not hidden by CSS or other means.\n    *   **No Exceptions:** The test execution should not encounter any unhandled exceptions (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clearly report any failed tests with detailed error messages and screenshots.\n    *   Provide a summary of the test execution results, including the number of tests passed and failed.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Root Servers website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the website's critical functions are validated effectively and efficiently."
