  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Root-Servers.net Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nRoot-Servers.net provides information about the DNS root name servers. While not a direct revenue-generating application, its availability and correct information are crucial for the internet's infrastructure. Failure can lead to widespread DNS resolution issues, impacting countless users and services.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **High Impact:** Failure to load the website or critical elements (like links to root server information) can disrupt access to essential DNS information.\n*   **Reputational Risk:** Website unavailability damages the credibility of the organization maintaining the root servers.\n*   **Data Integrity Risk:** Incorrect information displayed on the website can lead to misconfiguration and potential DNS resolution problems.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Website availability (HTTP 200 OK).\n*   Loading of critical page elements (text, images, links).\n*   Presence of specified buttons (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, etc.).\n*   Presence of specified links.\n*   Presence of specified menu bars.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Functionality of buttons and links (no clicking).\n*   Detailed content verification (beyond presence).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing.\n*   Error handling (e.g., 404 pages).\n*   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThis smoke suite focuses on verifying the basic health and availability of the Root-Servers.net website.\n\n**Test Cases:**\n\n1.  **Website Availability:**\n    *   Objective: Verify the website loads successfully.\n    *   Steps: Navigate to `https://root-servers.net`.\n    *   Expected Result: HTTP status code 200 OK is returned.\n2.  **Critical Element Loading:**\n    *   Objective: Verify critical elements are present on the homepage.\n    *   Steps: Navigate to `https://root-servers.net`.\n    *   Expected Result:\n        *   At least 5 of the following buttons are present: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, or any other relevant buttons.\n        *   At least 2 links are present.\n        *   At least 2 menu bars are present.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*Not applicable for Smoke Testing. This section would be populated for a full regression test strategy.*\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** For this smoke test, no specific test data is required beyond the target URL.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** While this is a smoke test, adopting a POM structure from the outset will facilitate future expansion into regression testing. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the elements and locators for the homepage.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential timing issues when verifying element presence. This allows the test to wait for an element to appear before failing, mitigating flakiness.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire test suite. If the smoke test fails due to transient network issues, retry the entire suite once or twice before reporting a failure.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should focus on the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage (`https://root-servers.net`):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP status code 200 OK for the homepage.\n    *   Presence of the required buttons, links, and menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   Any HTTP status code other than 200 OK.\n    *   Absence of any of the required buttons, links, or menu bars.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing the smoke test for Root-Servers.net. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical aspects of the website's functionality. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the website's basic health and availability, minimizing the risk of disruptions to DNS resolution."
