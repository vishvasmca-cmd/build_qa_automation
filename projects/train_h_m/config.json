Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for smoke testing the H&M e-commerce website (https://www2.hm.com). It serves as a blueprint for automated testing agents, providing detailed instructions on domain analysis, smoke suite definition, and strategic mining priorities. This plan ensures the autonomous agents efficiently verify critical functionalities and establish a robust foundation for further testing.\n\n## 2. Domain Information\n\n**Target URL:** https://www2.hm.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce (Fashion Retail)\n**Business Goal:** Provide an online platform for customers to browse, select, and purchase clothing, accessories, and home goods. Drive sales and brand engagement through a user-friendly and visually appealing online experience.\n\n**Domain Analysis:**\n\n*   **Target Audience:** Broad demographic, targeting fashion-conscious individuals of all ages and genders.\n*   **Key Functionality:** Product browsing, search, filtering, shopping cart, checkout, account management, order tracking.\n*   **Critical Pages:** Homepage, Category pages, Product Detail Pages (PDPs), Shopping Cart, Checkout pages, Account Dashboard.\n*   **Technology Stack (Inferred):** Likely built on a robust e-commerce platform (e.g., Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Magento, or custom solution), incorporating JavaScript frameworks for dynamic UI and API integrations for backend services.\n*   **Potential Risks:** Website downtime, payment processing errors, broken links, inaccurate product information, slow loading times, security vulnerabilities.\n\n## 3. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe Smoke Suite focuses on verifying the website's core functionality and ensuring a basic level of operational readiness.\n\n### 3.1. Test Suite: Website Availability & Core Navigation\n\n**Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and that core navigation elements are functioning correctly.\n\n**Test Cases:**\n\n1.  **Website Availability:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the H&M homepage (https://www2.hm.com) loads successfully and returns a 200 OK HTTP status code.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www2.hm.com.\n        2.  Verify the page loads completely within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        3.  Verify HTTP status code is 200.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully and returns a 200 OK status code.\n\n2.  **Core Menu Links Functionality:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the main menu links navigate to the correct pages.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www2.hm.com.\n        2.  Locate the main navigation menu (e.g., using CSS selector `#main-menu` or similar).\n        3.  Identify the top-level menu items (e.g., \"Women,\" \"Men,\" \"Divided,\" \"Baby,\" \"Kids,\" \"H&M HOME\").\n        4.  For each menu item:\n            *   Click the menu item.\n            *   Verify the URL changes to the expected URL (e.g., clicking \"Women\" should navigate to `/en_us/women.html` or similar).\n            *   Verify the page content corresponds to the selected menu item.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Each menu link navigates to the correct page with the expected content.\n\n### 3.2. Test Suite: Core Flow (Homepage Hero Verification and Shop Now Button)\n\n**Objective:** Verify a critical user flow starting from the homepage.\n\n**Test Cases:**\n\n1.  **Homepage Hero Headline Verification:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the hero headline on the H&M homepage contains the expected text.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www2.hm.com.\n        2.  Locate the hero section headline (e.g., using CSS selector `.hero__headline` or similar - inspect element on the page).\n        3.  Verify the headline text contains the string \"Fashion and quality at the best price\".\n    *   **Expected Result:** The hero headline contains the expected text.\n\n2.  **\"Shop Now\" Button Functionality:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the \"Shop Now\" button within the hero section navigates to a relevant category page.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www2.hm.com.\n        2.  Locate the \"Shop Now\" button within the hero section (e.g., using CSS selector `.hero__button` or similar - inspect element on the page).\n        3.  Click the \"Shop Now\" button.\n        4.  Verify the URL changes to a relevant category page (e.g., `/en_us/women.html` or `/en_us/new-arrivals.html`).  Acceptable URLs depend on the site's current configuration.\n        5.  Verify the page content corresponds to a product listing or category page.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Clicking the \"Shop Now\" button navigates to a relevant category page.\n\n## 4. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agents on prioritizing element discovery and analysis.\n\n*   **Prioritize Homepage Elements:**  The homepage is the entry point for most users.  Focus on identifying and analyzing all interactive elements, including:\n    *   Hero section elements (headline, buttons, images).\n    *   Navigation menu links (top-level and sub-menu items).\n    *   Featured product carousels.\n    *   Promotional banners.\n    *   Footer links (customer service, about us, etc.).\n*   **Category Pages:** After the homepage, prioritize category pages (e.g., \"Women,\" \"Men,\" \"Kids\").\n    *   Mine product listings.\n    *   Mine filter options (size, color, price).\n    *   Mine pagination elements.\n*   **Product Detail Pages (PDPs):**  Focus on extracting:\n    *   Product name and description.\n    *   Price and available sizes.\n    *   \"Add to Cart\" button.\n    *   Image carousel.\n    *   Related product recommendations.\n*   **Dynamic Content:** Pay close attention to elements that load dynamically (e.g., using AJAX) and may require specific handling (e.g., waiting for elements to appear).\n*   **Accessibility Attributes:**  When mining elements, always collect accessibility attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `alt` text) for future accessibility testing.\n*   **Mobile vs. Desktop:** Identify elements that differ between mobile and desktop versions of the site. Prioritize mining the desktop version first, then compare to the mobile version.\n\n## 5. Reporting\n\nThe automated test execution should generate clear and concise reports, including:\n\n*   Test case pass/fail status.\n*   Error messages and screenshots for failed tests.\n*   Execution time for each test case.\n*   Overall test suite execution time.\n*   Detailed logs for debugging purposes.\n\n## 6. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the smoke suite to cover more critical flows, such as account creation, login, and checkout.\n*   Implement data-driven testing to verify functionality with different input values.\n*   Integrate accessibility testing into the suite.\n*   Monitor website performance metrics (e.g., page load time) as part of the testing process.\n```"
