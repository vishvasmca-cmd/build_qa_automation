Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the master test plan for a smoke test of the Airbnb website (https://www.airbnb.com). This plan is designed to verify the core functionality and stability of the platform, ensuring it is in a usable state for further testing and user access. The plan will provide clear instructions on critical flows and element mining to optimize autonomous agent efficiency.\n\n**2. Domain Information & Analysis**\n\n*   **Domain:** Airbnb.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Online Marketplace / Hospitality / Travel / E-commerce\n*   **Primary Goal:** Connect travelers with hosts offering accommodations, experiences, and related services worldwide. Facilitate booking and payment transactions between users. Drive user acquisition and engagement.\n*   **Key Areas of Functionality:**\n    *   **Search & Discovery:** Allowing users to search for accommodations and experiences based on location, dates, price, amenities, and other criteria.\n    *   **Booking & Payment:** Securely processing booking requests and payments between guests and hosts.\n    *   **User Accounts & Profiles:** Managing user profiles, booking history, messaging, and reviews.\n    *   **Host Management:** Enabling hosts to list their properties or experiences, manage bookings, and communicate with guests.\n    *   **Customer Support:** Providing resources and assistance to users experiencing issues.\n    *   **Mobile Accessibility:** Ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.\n    *   **Map Integration:** Offering users a visual representation of properties or experiences via interactive maps.\n\n**3. Scope**\n\nThis smoke test focuses on verifying the most critical functionalities of the Airbnb website. It is *not* intended to be a comprehensive test but rather a quick check to ensure the site is operational and core features are working.\n\n**4. Test Objectives**\n\n*   Verify that the Airbnb website is accessible and loading correctly.\n*   Ensure core navigation links are functional.\n*   Validate that the primary user flow of searching, selecting, and initiating a booking is operational.\n\n**5. Smoke Test Suite Definition**\n\nThis section details the specific test cases included in the smoke test suite.\n\n**Test Suite Name:** Airbnb Smoke Test\n\n**Test Environment:** Production (https://www.airbnb.com)\n\n**Test Cases:**\n\n*   **TC_01: Website Availability**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the Airbnb homepage loads successfully.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.airbnb.com.\n        2.  Verify that the page loads within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        3.  Verify HTTP status code is 200.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The Airbnb homepage loads completely without errors. The HTTP status code is 200.\n\n*   **TC_02: Core Navigation Links**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the main navigation links are functional.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.airbnb.com.\n        2.  Locate the main navigation menu (typically in the header).\n        3.  Click each primary link (e.g., \"Stays,\" \"Experiences,\" \"Online Experiences\").\n        4.  Verify that each link navigates to the expected page.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Each navigation link successfully redirects to the corresponding page without errors.\n\n*   **TC_03: Hero Section Verification**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the Airbnb Hero headline text.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.airbnb.com.\n        2.  Locate the main hero section.\n        3.  Verify the headline contains the text \"Book unique homes and experiences\".\n    *   **Expected Result:** The headline in the hero section contains the correct text.\n\n*   **TC_04: \"Start Your Search\" Button Functionality**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the \"Start Your Search\" button is present and functional.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.airbnb.com.\n        2.  Locate the \"Start Your Search\" button.\n        3.  Click the \"Start Your Search\" button.\n        4.  Verify that clicking the button navigates to the search page.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Clicking the \"Start Your Search\" button successfully redirects to the search page.\n\n**6. Strategic Mining Instructions**\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agent on which elements and pages to prioritize for mining, ensuring efficient test execution.\n\n*   **Prioritized Elements:**\n    *   **Header Navigation:** Specifically, the `<a>` tags within the main navigation menu (identified by common CSS selectors like `#header`, `.nav`, or specific Airbnb-defined classes).\n    *   **Hero Section:** The main section of the homepage. Prioritize mining the `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags for verification of headlines.\n    *   **\"Start Your Search\" Button:**  Focus on `<button>` elements with text content or accessible names containing \"Start Your Search\" or similar variations.  Also mine for `aria-label`.\n*   **Prioritized Pages:**\n    *   **Homepage (/)**: Critical for overall site availability and initial user experience.\n    *   **Search Page (/s/{location}/homes)**:  Mine elements related to search filters (dates, guests, price range).  (Note: \"{location}\" is a placeholder; the agent should identify a valid location to test).\n\n**7. Test Data**\n\n*   This smoke test does not require specific test data. It focuses on verifying the functionality of the website with default settings.\n\n**8. Automation Considerations**\n\n*   The smoke test suite is highly suitable for automation.\n*   Use reliable element locators (e.g., IDs, data attributes) to ensure test stability.\n*   Implement explicit waits to handle dynamic content loading.\n*   Consider using a headless browser for faster execution.\n\n**9. Reporting**\n\n*   Test results should be clearly reported, indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n*   Include screenshots or video recordings of any failures to aid in debugging.\n*   Generate a summary report with overall test execution statistics.\n\n**10. Success/Failure Criteria**\n\n*   **Success:** All test cases in the smoke test suite pass.\n*   **Failure:** Any test case in the smoke test suite fails.  A failure indicates a critical issue that requires immediate attention.\n\n**11. Exit Criteria**\n\n*   The smoke test is considered complete when all test cases have been executed and the results have been reported.\n*   If any test cases fail, the issues must be resolved and the smoke test re-executed until all tests pass.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a clear framework for conducting a smoke test of the Airbnb website. By following these guidelines, the autonomous agent can efficiently verify the core functionality and stability of the platform, ensuring a positive user experience."
