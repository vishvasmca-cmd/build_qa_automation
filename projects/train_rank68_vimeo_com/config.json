  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Vimeo.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the smoke testing of Vimeo.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Vimeo is a video-sharing platform. Core functionality includes website launch, user authentication (login/signup), and navigation. Failure in these areas directly impacts user access and engagement.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionality (login, signup, navigation) leads to:\n    *   **Loss of User Access:** Users cannot access their accounts or content.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user experience and potential churn.\n    *   **Loss of Potential Revenue:** Inability for new users to sign up for paid services.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Verification of the presence and basic functionality (existence) of these elements.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual features.\n        *   Video playback or upload.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n        *   Error handling and negative testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to `https://vimeo.com`. Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Element Verification:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Verification:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element Verification:** Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" (or similar) button/link.\n        5.  **Button Verification:** Verify the presence of 5 distinct buttons on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Verification:** Verify the presence of 2 distinct links on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Verification:** Verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Vimeo homepage. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class with methods to identify and verify the presence of the required elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for element to be present) to handle potential loading delays.  This helps avoid false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for element identification in case of intermittent loading issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://vimeo.com`):** Focus on the main landing page for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Verification:**\n        *   Elements (buttons, links, menu bars) are present on the page (using appropriate locators - e.g., XPath, CSS selectors).\n        *   Elements are visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS).\n    *   **Success:** All verification criteria are met. If any verification fails, the smoke test fails."
