  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Trafficmanager.net - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Trafficmanager.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Trafficmanager.net appears to be a general web application, potentially offering traffic management or related services. The website's availability and core functionality are critical for user acquisition and engagement.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities (website launch, navigation, key button/link visibility) can lead to immediate user attrition, damage to brand reputation, and loss of potential customers. This is considered a high-risk scenario.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Identification and verification of the presence of specified UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Basic visual verification of UI elements (e.g., buttons and links are visible and not broken).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons and links (no clicking or navigation).\n        *   Detailed visual testing (e.g., pixel-perfect comparisons).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website (https://trafficmanager.net) loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"GetStarted\" button is present on the page.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button is present on the page.\n        5.  **Button Count:** Verify at least 5 buttons are present on the page.\n        6.  **Link Count:** Verify at least 2 links are present on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Count:** Verify at least 2 menu bars are present on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:**  (Not applicable for Smoke Testing.  This section is included for future expansion.)\n    *   N/A - Smoke tests are not intended to be comprehensive regression tests.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for smoke tests, as we are only verifying the presence of UI elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the website's pages and UI elements. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a base `Page` class with common functionalities (e.g., `isElementPresent`, `getPageTitle`).\n        *   Create specific page classes (e.g., `HomePage`) that inherit from the `Page` class and define locators and methods for elements on that page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with a reasonable timeout to handle potential loading delays. This will prevent false failures due to elements not being immediately available.  For example, wait up to 5 seconds for an element to be present before failing the test.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for specific elements to be present or visible before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://trafficmanager.net):** Focus on identifying and verifying the presence of the specified UI elements on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code and page title is present.\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page (verified using element locators).  The elements should be visible (e.g., not hidden by CSS).\n    *   **Element Count:** The number of buttons, links, and menu bars meet the specified criteria."
