  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Computer Database Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://computer-database.gatling.io/computers\n**Business Domain:** Generic (Computer Database Management)\n\nThis document outlines the comprehensive test strategy for the computer database application, ensuring its reliability, stability, and performance. This strategy will guide the testing efforts of the entire engineering team, including Senior QAs, Test Architects, and SDETs.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n**1.1 Domain Analysis:**\n\nThe application allows users to manage a database of computers, including adding, editing, searching, and deleting entries. While the domain is generic, data integrity and operational stability are critical. A failure in these areas can lead to inaccurate data, system downtime, and ultimately, loss of user trust.\n\n**1.2 Risk Profile:**\n\nThe application's risk profile is moderate. Potential risks include:\n\n*   **Data Corruption:** Bugs during create, update, or delete operations could lead to corrupted or lost data.\n*   **Functional Failures:** Inability to add, edit, or delete computers.\n*   **Performance Degradation:** Slow response times could frustrate users.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Although not explicitly stated, input validation failures can lead to injection attacks.\n\n**1.3 Testing Scope:**\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   All functionalities related to computer management (add, edit, delete, search, filter).\n    *   Data validation (input types, required fields, and data formats).\n    *   UI/UX (consistency, usability).\n    *   Basic security checks (input sanitization).\n    *   Performance testing (response times under load).\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Extensive performance testing (beyond basic load testing).\n    *   Detailed security penetration testing.\n    *   Integration with external systems (if any).\n    *   Mobile testing (unless specifically required).\n    *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n**2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\nThe smoke suite focuses on the application's core functionality to ensure basic operability after each build.\n\n*   **Tests:**\n    1.  Verify the application homepage loads successfully.\n    2.  Verify the 'Add a new computer' page loads successfully.\n    3.  Add a new computer with minimal required fields and verify successful creation.\n    4.  Search for the created computer and verify it appears in the search results.\n    5.  Delete the created computer and verify successful deletion.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All tests in the smoke suite must pass for the build to be considered stable and promoted to further testing phases.\n\n**2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n\nThe regression suite provides a comprehensive assessment of the application's functionality and stability.\n\n*   **Tests:**\n\n    *   **Positive Testing:**\n        1.  Create a computer with all fields populated (including optional ones).\n        2.  Edit all fields of an existing computer.\n        3.  Search for a computer using different search criteria (name, company).\n        4.  Filter computers by company.\n        5.  Delete a computer.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        1.  Attempt to create a computer with invalid data (e.g., incorrect date format, special characters in name, blank fields). Verify appropriate error messages are displayed.\n        2.  Attempt to create a computer with a name that already exists (if uniqueness is enforced).\n        3.  Attempt to edit a computer with invalid data.\n        4.  Attempt to delete a computer that doesn't exist.\n        5.  Test search functionality with invalid search terms (e.g., SQL injection attempts).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        1.  Create a large number of computers (e.g., 1000) and verify performance.\n        2.  Test with very long computer names and descriptions.\n        3.  Test with boundary values for date fields (earliest and latest possible dates).\n        4.  Test with empty company selection (if allowed).\n    *   **Security Testing (Basic OWASP Top 10):**\n        1.  Input validation on all fields to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. Sanitize all input before processing.\n        2.  Error message handling: Avoid displaying sensitive information in error messages.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data should be used.\n        *   **Static Data:**  Predefined sets of computer names, company names, and dates should be maintained for consistent testing.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:**  Unique computer names should be generated using a timestamp or UUID to avoid naming conflicts.\n        *   **Data Management:**  A dedicated data management strategy should be implemented to manage and maintain test data. Tools like Faker or custom data generators can be used.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n**3.1 Framework Recommendation:**\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to abstract UI elements and interactions. This will improve code maintainability and reduce test duplication.  Each page of the application (e.g., ComputerListPage, AddComputerPage, EditComputerPage) should have its own page object.\n\n**3.2 Resilience Strategy:**\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous operations and element availability.  Instead of failing immediately when an element is not found, retry the assertion for a specified duration.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific elements to be in a desired state (e.g., visible, clickable).\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms.  For example, if an element is not found, try refreshing the page or retrying the action.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests. This can help mitigate flaky tests caused by temporary network issues or server instability.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n**4.1 Mining Targets:**\n\nBased on the user goal, the autonomous agent should prioritize the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Computer Listing Page:** `https://computer-database.gatling.io/computers` (Entry Point and Filter/Search target)\n2.  **Add New Computer Page:** accessed by clicking 'Add a new computer'. (Create functionality)\n3.  **Edit Computer Page:** accessed by clicking on a computer entry in the listing. (Update/Delete functionality)\n\n**4.2 Verification Criteria:**\n\n*   **Successful Page Load:** HTTP 200 status code and the presence of key UI elements (e.g., page title, buttons, input fields).\n*   **Successful Computer Creation:** After submitting the \"Add a new computer\" form, verify:\n    *   A success message is displayed.\n    *   The computer appears in the computer listing page.\n*   **Successful Computer Update:** After submitting the \"Edit Computer\" form, verify:\n    *   A success message is displayed.\n    *   The computer details are updated in the computer listing page.\n*   **Successful Computer Deletion:** After clicking the \"Delete\" button, verify:\n    *   A success message is displayed.\n    *   The computer is no longer present in the computer listing page.\n*   **Error Message Validation:** When negative tests are performed, verify that appropriate error messages are displayed and are user-friendly.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for ensuring the quality and reliability of the computer database application.  It will be reviewed and updated as needed to adapt to changing requirements and application updates."
