  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: trbcdn.net - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the trbcdn.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** trbcdn.net appears to be a general web application. Without further context, we assume a moderate business criticality. Failure to load the website or critical elements could lead to user frustration and potential loss of engagement.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A failure of the website to load or a broken login/signup process could result in a loss of potential users and damage to the brand's reputation.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, and 3 other buttons.\n        *   Presence of 2 links.\n        *   Presence of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Load:**\n        *   Navigate to `https://trbcdn.net`.\n        *   Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status).\n        *   Verify the presence of a basic page title.\n    *   **Test Case 2: Key Element Presence:**\n        *   Verify the presence of \"Login\" button/link.\n        *   Verify the presence of \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link.\n        *   Verify the presence of 3 other distinct buttons.\n        *   Verify the presence of 2 distinct links.\n        *   Verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite (N/A - Smoke Test Only):**  Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No test data is required for this smoke test, as it only verifies the presence of elements.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   While this is a smoke test and doesn't require extensive automation, using a lightweight framework with basic element identification capabilities is recommended for maintainability.  Consider Playwright, Selenium, or Cypress.\n    *   Implement a basic Page Object Model (POM) structure, even for the smoke tests. This will make the tests more maintainable as the application evolves. Create a `HomePage` object with locators for the elements being verified.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitForElementToBePresent()`) to handle potential loading delays.  Set a reasonable timeout (e.g., 5 seconds).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire test case in case of intermittent network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://trbcdn.net`):** Focus on identifying the Login, Signup/Get Started buttons/links, other buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200.\n        *   Page title is present (even if the exact title is unknown).\n    *   **Key Element Presence:**\n        *   Elements are present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n        *   Elements are visible on the page.\n        *   Text of \"Login\" and \"Signup/Get Started\" elements is reasonably close to the expected text (e.g., case-insensitive match).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the trbcdn.net website. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure a robust and reliable testing process."
