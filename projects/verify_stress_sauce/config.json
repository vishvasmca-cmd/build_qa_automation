  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com E-commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the Saucedemo.com e-commerce application. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, encompassing risk assessment, testing approach, architectural guidelines, and execution instructions. This strategy prioritizes ensuring the reliability and stability of critical business functionalities.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: The target application is an e-commerce platform. A failure in core functionalities (e.g., checkout, payments, inventory) can lead to direct financial loss and erosion of customer trust.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**: High. Failures can result in lost revenue, customer dissatisfaction, and potential damage to brand reputation. A data breach, while less likely in this demo app, would be catastrophic.\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Authentication (Login/Logout)\n        *   Product Catalog (Viewing, Searching, Sorting)\n        *   Shopping Cart (Adding, Removing, Modifying Items)\n        *   Checkout Process (Information Input, Payment Simulation, Order Confirmation)\n        *   Navigation between pages and modules\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed performance testing (load, stress, etc.) - unless specific performance issues are identified.\n        *   Complex security penetration testing. (However, basic OWASP Top 10 input validation is IN SCOPE).\n        *   3rd party API integrations (beyond basic success/failure simulation).\n        *   Detailed error reporting outside UI and network level checks.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nWe will employ a tiered testing approach using Smoke and Regression suites, focusing on the areas highlighted by the User Goal.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**: This suite provides a rapid health check after each build or deployment.\n    *   Login with valid credentials (`standard_user`/`secret_sauce`).\n    *   Verify successful navigation to the inventory page.\n    *   Add one item to the cart.\n    *   Navigate to the cart page.\n    *   Navigate to the Checkout page.\n    *   Fill in Checkout Information (Name/Lastname/ZIP)\n    *   Complete the checkout process\n    *   Logout\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**: This comprehensive suite verifies that new changes haven't introduced regressions and thoroughly tests existing functionality. It encompasses:\n\n    *   **Authentication**:\n        *   Login with locked-out user.\n        *   Login with invalid password.\n    *   **Product Catalog**:\n        *   Sort products Z-A (as per the User Goal).\n        *   View product details for 'Sauce Labs Onesie'.\n        *   Handle empty search results.\n    *   **Shopping Cart**:\n        *   Add \"Sauce Labs Bike Light\" to the cart (as per User Goal).\n        *   Remove items from the cart.\n        *   Update item quantities.\n        *   Attempt to add an out-of-stock item (verify appropriate error message).\n        *   Verify cart persistence across page refreshes.\n    *   **Checkout & Payments**:\n        *   Successful checkout with valid information.\n        *   Checkout with incomplete/invalid information (e.g., missing zip code, invalid characters in name).\n        *   Simulate payment failure.\n    *   **Negative Testing**:\n        *   Invalid inputs in all forms (e.g., special characters, SQL injection attempts in name fields - basic OWASP check).\n        *   Boundary values (e.g., extremely long names/addresses).\n        *   Simulating network timeouts during critical operations (e.g., checkout).\n    *   **Edge Cases**:\n        *   Concurrency (multiple users adding/removing items simultaneously - *if applicable to the architecture*).\n        *   Handling empty states (e.g., empty search results, empty cart).\n    *   **Security**:\n        *   Basic input validation to prevent common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS). This is not a full security audit, but a preventative measure.\n\n*   **Data Strategy**: We will utilize a combination of:\n\n    *   **Static Test Data**: For core scenarios (e.g., valid login credentials: `standard_user`/`secret_sauce`).  This data is known and consistent.\n    *   **Dynamic Generation**: For data that needs to be unique or randomized (e.g., generating unique email addresses for registration, random names/addresses for checkout).  Faker libraries are recommended.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**: **Page Object Model (POM)** with clear separation of concerns. Each page in the application should be represented by a Page Object, encapsulating the elements and actions available on that page.\n    *   Example: `LoginPage`, `InventoryPage`, `CartPage`, `CheckoutPage`.\n*   **Technology Stack**: Selenium WebDriver, Cypress, or Playwright are all suitable choices. The selection should be based on team familiarity and project requirements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**: To mitigate test flakiness:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use explicit waits and polling mechanisms to wait for elements to appear/be interactable before performing actions or assertions.\n        *   Example: Instead of `Assert.IsTrue(element.Displayed)`, use `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).Until(ExpectedConditions.ElementIsVisible(element))`\n    *   **Implement Self-Healing**: If an element is not found, attempt to locate it using alternative locators (e.g., fallback to XPath if ID is not available).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a mechanism to retry failed tests a limited number of times. This is especially useful for handling transient network issues.\n    *   **Environment Isolation**: Ensure tests are run in a consistent and isolated environment to minimize external factors affecting test results.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**: Focus the initial autonomous exploration on the following pages/flows:\n    *   **Login Page**: Explore different login attempts (valid/invalid credentials).\n    *   **Inventory Page**: Focus on the sorting functionality (Z-A as requested), add items to cart\n    *   **Product Details Page**: Inspect 'Sauce Labs Onesie' and return to inventory.\n    *   **Cart Page**: Verify items added and checkout process.\n    *   **Checkout Pages**: Verify functionality of all pages (information, overview, confirmation).\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n\n    *   **Successful HTTP Response Codes**: Verify that all requests return a 200 OK status (or appropriate status code for errors).\n    *   **Expected Element Visibility**: Verify that key elements are displayed on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product names on the inventory page, cart total on the cart page, \"Thank You\" message on the confirmation page).\n    *   **Data Integrity**: Verify that data is correctly displayed and persisted across pages (e.g., item quantities in the cart, shipping address during checkout).\n    *   **Functional Correctness**: Verify that the application behaves as expected according to the defined requirements (e.g., sorting works correctly, items are added to the cart successfully, checkout process completes without errors).\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   Detailed test reports that clearly indicate passed, failed, and skipped tests.\n    *   Failure analysis to identify the root cause of failures.\n    *   Regular communication with the development team to address identified issues.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated as needed to adapt to evolving requirements and changes in the application."
