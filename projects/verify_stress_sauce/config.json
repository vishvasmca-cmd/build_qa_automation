  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com E-Commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Saucedemo.com e-commerce application. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding test automation and execution efforts.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business functions revolve around product browsing, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure in critical areas like authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders results in lost revenue.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Poor user experience due to bugs can erode customer trust.\n    *   **Operational Inefficiency:** Support costs increase when users encounter issues.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:** All functionalities related to user authentication, product catalog browsing, shopping cart management, checkout process, and order confirmation. Specifically, the user goal provided will be a key test case.\n    *   **Out of Scope:** Third-party integrations (payment gateways, shipping providers) will be tested at a high level but are primarily the responsibility of those vendors. Performance testing and load testing are out of scope for this initial regression strategy.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on both Smoke and Regression testing to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core functionality of the application after each build.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        *   Successful User Login with valid credentials ('standard_user'/'secret\\_sauce').\n        *   Product Catalog Page Loads Successfully.\n        *   Add one item to cart.\n        *   Navigate to the checkout page.\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After every build deployment.\n    *   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** If any smoke test fails, the build is rejected.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To ensure that new changes haven't introduced regressions in existing functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        *   **Based on User Goal:**\n            *   Login with 'standard\\_user'/'secret\\_sauce'.\n            *   Sort products Z-A.\n            *   Add 'Test.allTheThings() T-Shirt' to cart.\n            *   Go to item details 'Sauce Labs Onesie'.\n            *   Go back to product listing.\n            *   Add 'Sauce Labs Bike Light' to cart.\n            *   Go to Cart.\n            *   Checkout.\n            *   Enter info 'Jane' 'Doe' '12345'.\n            *   Finish checkout.\n            *   Back Home.\n            *   Logout.\n        *   **Negative Testing:**\n            *   Invalid Login attempts (incorrect username/password).\n            *   Checkout with missing required fields.\n            *   Attempt to add more items to the cart than available in stock.\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n            *   Network failures during checkout (simulate network drops).\n            *   Empty cart scenarios.\n        *   **Security:**\n            *   Basic input validation to prevent XSS attacks (e.g., try to enter `<script>` tags in input fields).\n            *   Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities (e.g., try to enter SQL commands in input fields).\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment and before major releases.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:** User credentials ('standard\\_user'/'secret\\_sauce'), product names, and other fixed values will be stored in configuration files.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** User information (first name, last name, zip code) will be dynamically generated using libraries or APIs to ensure uniqueness and avoid conflicts.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should have a corresponding page object that encapsulates the elements and actions on that page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) to handle asynchronous operations and avoid false failures due to timing issues.\n        *   **Self-Healing:** Implement self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors, such as stale element references.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for those that are prone to flakiness.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Prioritize the User Goal flow:** Login -> Sort -> Add Items -> View Details -> Back -> Add Item -> Cart -> Checkout -> Info -> Finish -> Home -> Logout.\n    *   **Authentication Page:** Focus on login and logout functionality.\n    *   **Product Catalog Page:** Explore product listing, sorting, and filtering options.\n    *   **Product Details Page:** Verify product information and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n    *   **Shopping Cart Page:** Test adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.\n    *   **Checkout Page:** Focus on entering shipping information and completing the order.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Successful Login:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Products\" text visible on the page.\n    *   **Product Added to Cart:** HTTP 200 status code AND Cart icon displays the correct number of items.\n    *   **Checkout Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Thank you for your order!\" text visible on the page.\n    *   **Logout Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND Login page is displayed.\n    *   **General:** Verify that all UI elements are displayed correctly and that there are no JavaScript errors in the console.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing the Saucedemo.com e-commerce application. It will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the business."
