  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Google Syndication Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Google Syndication is a platform for publishers to monetize their content through advertising. Failure can lead to lost revenue for publishers and advertisers, impacting Google's reputation and financial performance.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. System downtime or critical functionality failure directly impacts revenue generation and partner relationships. Data breaches or security vulnerabilities could have severe legal and reputational consequences.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic accessibility (no broken links).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any UI elements (buttons, links, menu items).\n        *   Form submission or data input.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of advertising serving or reporting.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing beyond basic HTTPS verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited to a single, primary browser - e.g., Chrome).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the website is accessible and the core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar call-to-action button is present.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar button is present.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify the presence of a fourth button (e.g., \"Contact Us,\" \"Learn More\").\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify the presence of a fifth button.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify the presence of a link (e.g., \"Privacy Policy,\" \"Terms of Service\").\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify the presence of a second link.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify the presence of a main menu bar.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify the presence of a second menu bar (e.g., a footer menu).\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this \"smoke\" testing mandate.\n*   **Data Strategy:** No test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or processing.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability and scalability, even for this simple smoke test. Create Page Objects for the homepage and any relevant sections containing the target UI elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be present with a timeout) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Element Location Retries:** Implement retry logic for element location in case of minor UI changes or temporary inconsistencies.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Consider implementing basic self-healing capabilities to automatically adjust element locators based on minor UI changes (e.g., using relative locators).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage (/)**: Primary target for all UI element identification.\n    *   **Header Section**: Focus on the header for Login, Signup, and menu bars.\n    *   **Footer Section**: Focus on the footer for links and potentially additional menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP 200 OK:** The website must return an HTTP 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Each target UI element (buttons, links, menu bars) must be present on the page and visible.\n    *   **No Broken Links:** The identified links should not be broken (HTTP 404 or other error codes). This can be a simple check without clicking the link.\n    *   **Error Handling:** If any element is not found, the test should fail with a clear error message indicating the missing element."
