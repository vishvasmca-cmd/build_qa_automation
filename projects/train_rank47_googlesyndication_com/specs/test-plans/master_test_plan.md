# Test Plan: train_rank47_googlesyndication_com

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the train_rank47_googlesyndication_com project, focusing on verifying the presence and accessibility of key elements on the landing page, specifically buttons and links.

## 2. Scope

The testing will cover the identification of 5 buttons and 2 links on the googlesyndication.com website without interacting with them. The primary focus is on ensuring these elements are present and detectable.

## 3. Test Strategy

We will employ a two-pronged testing strategy:

*   **Smoke Testing:**  A high-level verification of the presence of critical UI elements (buttons and links).
*   **Regression Testing:** (Out of scope for this trace, but included for completeness) A more in-depth analysis of the functionality and behavior of these elements, including their interaction and response to different user actions.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The Smoke Suite will adhere to the following 8-point checklist:

1.  **Critical Path Focus:** Tests the most essential functionality (presence of key UI elements).
2.  **Positive Testing:** Verifies the presence of elements, not their absence or error handling.
3.  **Minimal Data Variation:** No data input is required for this smoke test.
4.  **Independent Tests:** Each test can be run independently.
5.  **Fast Execution:** Tests are designed for quick execution.
6.  **Automated Execution:** Tests are designed to be automated.
7.  **Build Acceptance:** Failure of any smoke test indicates a build failure.
8.  **Limited Scope:** Focuses solely on core functionality, excluding edge cases.

## 4. Test Environment

The tests will be executed in a standard web browser environment (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## 5. Test Cases

Detailed test cases are defined in the feature files.
