  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Forms.gle Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the initial Smoke Test of the Forms.gle website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Forms.gle falls under the general web application domain. While not explicitly e-commerce or healthcare, its availability and basic functionality are crucial for user engagement and data collection. Failure impacts user experience and potentially data acquisition.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failure leading to website unavailability results in:\n    *   **Loss of User Engagement:** Potential users unable to access the platform.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception due to website downtime.\n    *   **Missed Opportunities:** Inability to collect data through forms.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar) buttons (5 total).\n        *   Identification of 2 links.\n        *   Identification of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed functionality of forms.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Forms.gle URL loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify a \"Login\" button (or equivalent) is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button (or equivalent) is present on the page.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button (or equivalent) is present on the page.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify a fourth button (or equivalent) is present on the page.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify a fifth button (or equivalent) is present on the page.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a link is present on the page.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify a second link is present on the page.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present on the page.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify a second menu bar is present on the page.\n    *   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deferred):** A full regression suite will be defined *after* the smoke test is stable and the application's functionality is better understood. This will include:\n    *   Detailed functional testing of form creation, submission, and data handling.\n    *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid input).\n    *   Cross-browser and mobile compatibility testing.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For the smoke test, no specific test data is required. The focus is on UI element presence, not data manipulation.\n    *   For future regression testing, a combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used. Static data will cover common scenarios, while dynamic data will be used for boundary testing and negative scenarios.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and readability. Each page of the Forms.gle website should have a corresponding Page Object class that encapsulates the page's elements and actions.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible()`) to handle potential timing issues during page load.\n    *   **Element Identification Strategy:** Prioritize robust element locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `aria-label`) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a limited number of times before marking it as a failure.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://forms.gle):** This is the primary target for identifying the required UI elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars must be visible on the page. The exact text of the buttons may vary (e.g., \"Sign Up\" instead of \"Signup\"), but the *intent* must be clear.\n    *   **No Clicking:** The autonomous agent MUST NOT click on any of the identified elements during the smoke test. The goal is purely to verify their presence."
