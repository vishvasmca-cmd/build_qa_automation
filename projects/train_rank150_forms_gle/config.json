  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Forms.gle Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the initial smoke testing of the Forms.gle website. It provides a clear framework for the engineering team to ensure the core functionality is operational before proceeding with more comprehensive testing.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Forms.gle is a web application likely used for creating and managing online forms. Business criticality is moderate; failure to load the site or access core features impacts user productivity and data collection.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the smoke test indicates a critical system outage. Consequences include:\n    *   **Loss of User Access:** Inability to create or access forms.\n    *   **Data Collection Interruption:** Ongoing data collection processes are halted.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative impact on user trust and perception.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading of the homepage.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar), and any other 2 prominent buttons.\n        *   Identification of 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Form creation or submission.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Navigate to `https://forms.gle` and verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Button Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons with labels such as \"Login\", \"Sign Up\", \"Get Started\", \"Try for Free\", or similar call-to-action buttons.\n        3.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for this smoke test strategy.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate document after the smoke test is successful.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data manipulation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** While this is a smoke test, using POM principles from the start will improve maintainability. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the selectors for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for element to be present) to handle potential loading delays. A timeout of 5-10 seconds should be sufficient.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire smoke test suite in case of temporary network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://forms.gle`)**\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Load:** HTTP 200 OK status code.\n    2.  **Button Identification:**\n        *   Element is present in the DOM.\n        *   Element is a `<button>` or `<a>` tag with appropriate styling.\n        *   Text content matches expected values (e.g., \"Login\", \"Sign Up\").\n    3.  **Link Identification:**\n        *   Element is present in the DOM.\n        *   Element is an `<a>` tag.\n        *   `href` attribute is present.\n    4.  **Menu Bar Identification:**\n        *   Element is present in the DOM.\n        *   Element is a `<nav>` or `<div>` tag with appropriate styling.\n        *   Contains multiple menu items (links or buttons).\n*   **Success Definition:** All test cases pass consistently.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for the initial smoke testing of Forms.gle. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality is operational and ready for more comprehensive testing."
