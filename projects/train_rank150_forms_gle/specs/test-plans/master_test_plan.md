# Test Plan: train_rank150_forms_gle

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the train_rank150_forms_gle project, focusing on testing the core functionality of the application. The primary goal is to ensure the application functions as expected and to identify any potential defects.

## 2. Scope

The testing will cover the following areas:

*   Navigation to the target website.
*   Identification of buttons and links on the page.

## 3. Test Strategy

We will employ a risk-based testing approach, prioritizing the most critical functionalities. The test suite will consist of smoke and regression tests.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite will focus on verifying the core functionality of the application. The following checklist will be applied:

1.  **Critical Functionality:** Tests cover the most important features.
2.  **Positive Testing:** Focus on happy path scenarios.
3.  **End-to-End Flow:** Tests cover complete workflows.
4.  **Minimal Data Set:** Use a small, representative data set.
5.  **Fast Execution:** Tests should run quickly.
6.  **Stable Environment:** Run in a stable and representative environment.
7.  **Automated Execution:** Tests are automated for repeatability.
8.  **Build Acceptance:** Passing smoke tests indicates a stable build.

### Regression Suite Strategy

The regression suite will cover a broader range of scenarios, including alternative flows, negative tests, and edge cases. This suite will be executed after any code changes to ensure that existing functionality remains intact.

## 4. Test Environment

The tests will be executed in a standard web browser environment.

## 5. Test Deliverables

*   Test Plan
*   Test Cases (Gherkin Feature Files)
*   Test Results

## 6. Test Schedule

The testing will be conducted according to the project schedule.
