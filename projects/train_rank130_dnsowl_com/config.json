  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: DNSOwl.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the DNSOwl.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** DNSOwl.com appears to be a web application providing DNS-related services. The business criticality depends on the services offered (e.g., DNS monitoring, security). Failure could lead to service disruption, data breaches, or loss of customer trust.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A failure in core functionality (e.g., website availability, user authentication) poses a high risk. This could result in immediate loss of potential customers and damage to brand reputation.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, 2 other buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the buttons/links/menu bars (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX testing (e.g., responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Negative testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and the core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the DNSOwl.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **UI Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements on the homepage:\n            *   Login button\n            *   Signup/GetStarted button (or equivalent)\n            *   Try for Free button (or equivalent)\n            *   2 other buttons (any)\n            *   2 links (any)\n            *   2 menu bars (any)\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   No test data is required for this smoke test, as it only involves verifying the presence of UI elements.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the DNSOwl.com homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability. Create a `HomePage` class with methods to identify the required UI elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential delays in element loading. This will reduce flakiness.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to be present before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** DNSOwl.com homepage (`https://dnsowl.com`).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Availability:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) is returned.\n    *   **UI Element Identification:** Each specified UI element (Login, Signup, Try for Free, 2 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) is present on the page.  The test should fail if any of these elements are missing.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   A clear pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages in case of failure, including the missing UI element."
