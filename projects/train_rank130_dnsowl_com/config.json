  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: DNSOwl.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the DNSOwl.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** DNSOwl.com likely provides DNS-related services. Website availability and basic functionality are crucial for user acquisition and service delivery.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core website functionality (e.g., inability to access the site, login, or sign up) can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of potential customers:** Users unable to access the site may seek alternative solutions.\n    *   **Damage to reputation:** Website downtime or broken functionality reflects poorly on the company.\n    *   **Reduced service adoption:** If users cannot easily sign up or try the service, adoption rates will suffer.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website accessibility and load times.\n        *   Existence and visibility of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, and specified links.\n        *   Existence of menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of each button/link (e.g., actual login process, signup workflow).\n        *   Performance testing beyond initial load time.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Error handling (e.g., invalid input).\n        *   API testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the core functionality of the DNSOwl.com website is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Accessibility:** Verify the website loads successfully within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        2.  **Login Button Existence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Existence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button (or equivalent) is present and visible on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Existence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button (or equivalent) is present and visible on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button Existence (Additional 2):** Identify and verify the existence of two more prominent buttons on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Existence (2):** Identify and verify the existence of two prominent links on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Existence (2):** Verify the existence of two menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for Smoke testing, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   **Objective:** Ensure no regressions are introduced with new code changes.\n    *   **Test Cases:** (Examples - will be expanded later)\n        *   Login functionality with valid credentials.\n        *   Signup process with valid data.\n        *   Navigation through all menu items.\n        *   Form submission with valid and invalid data.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For smoke tests, data requirements are minimal. No specific test data is required as we are only verifying the existence of elements.\n    *   For regression tests (future), a combination of static and dynamic test data will be used. Static data will be stored in configuration files, while dynamic data will be generated programmatically.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the website as a class. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the homepage.\n        *   `LoginPage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the login page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable. This helps mitigate timing issues and flakiness.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed test cases, especially for network-related issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`/`):** This is the primary target for identifying buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Accessibility:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) is returned.\n    *   **Element Existence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present in the DOM (Document Object Model) and are visible on the page.  Visibility can be determined by checking the `isDisplayed()` property of the WebElement.\n    *   **Load Time:** The website loads within 5 seconds.  (This can be measured using browser performance APIs).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for smoke testing the DNSOwl.com website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the core functionality of the application is working as expected, minimizing the risk of critical failures."
