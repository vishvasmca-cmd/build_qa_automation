  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Adobe.com Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Adobe.com is a high-visibility website for a major software vendor. Failure impacts brand reputation, customer acquisition, and potentially revenue (if e-commerce functionalities are affected).\n*   **Risk Profile**: High. Website unavailability or critical function failure (login, signup) can lead to significant loss of potential customers and damage brand trust.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, 2 other buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic accessibility (no broken links).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Form submission.\n        *   Detailed functionality of any specific Adobe product.\n        *   Performance testing (beyond basic page load).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially focus on desktop).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Negative testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the core website is up and running and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Website Launch**: Verify the Adobe.com homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Element Identification**: Verify the presence of the following elements on the homepage:\n            *   Login button\n            *   Signup/Get Started button\n            *   Try for Free button\n            *   Two (2) other distinct buttons (e.g., \"Learn More\", \"Buy Now\")\n            *   Two (2) distinct links (e.g., \"Products\", \"Support\")\n            *   Two (2) distinct menu bars (e.g., \"Creativity & Design\", \"Marketing & Commerce\")\n*   **Regression Suite**: Not applicable for a smoke test strategy.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   No test data is required for this smoke test. The tests only verify the presence of elements, not their functionality.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for future test automation. Even for this simple smoke test, creating Page Objects for the main Adobe.com page will provide a foundation for more complex tests later.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions with reasonable timeouts (e.g., 5-10 seconds) to allow for potential delays in element loading. This helps avoid false failures due to transient network issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for the entire test suite. If the smoke test fails, retry it once or twice before failing the build. This can mitigate flakiness due to temporary environmental issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    *   **Primary Target**: Adobe.com homepage (https://adobe.com).\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    1.  **Website Launch**:\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"Adobe\" (case-insensitive).\n    2.  **Element Identification**:\n        *   Each specified button, link, and menu bar element is present on the page (using appropriate CSS selectors or XPath expressions).\n        *   Elements are visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS).\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots for failed test cases to aid in debugging.\n    *   Integrate test results with the CI/CD pipeline to provide immediate feedback on build quality."
