  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan tailored for Wayfair.com, focusing on smoke testing as requested, and designed to guide autonomous agents in effective testing.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Wayfair.com - Smoke Test\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the master test plan for conducting smoke tests on Wayfair.com.  The primary goal is to ensure the website is operational, core navigation is functional, and a critical user flow is executable. This test plan will guide autonomous agents in efficiently validating these key aspects of the application.\n\n**2. Project Scope**\n\n*   **Target URL:** https://www.wayfair.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Ecommerce (Home Goods)\n*   **Testing Type:** Smoke Testing\n*   **User Goal:** Navigate to the Wayfair homepage, verify the hero headline contains 'A zillion things home', find and click the 'Shop Now' button.\n*   **Out of Scope:**  Detailed product page testing, cart functionality, checkout processes, account management, cross-browser compatibility beyond a single primary browser (e.g., Chrome), performance testing, security testing.\n\n**3. Domain Information & Analysis**\n\nWayfair.com is a large-scale e-commerce platform specializing in home goods, furniture, and decor.  The website's architecture is complex, involving numerous categories, product listings, user accounts, and backend services.\n\n*   **Key Areas:**\n    *   Homepage:  Entry point for all users, showcasing promotions, categories, and featured products.\n    *   Category Pages:  Organized listings of products based on type (e.g., furniture, lighting, rugs).\n    *   Product Pages:  Detailed information about individual products, including images, descriptions, reviews, and pricing.\n    *   Search Functionality:  Allows users to find specific products using keywords.\n    *   User Account:  Allows users to create and manage their account information, order history, and saved items.\n    *   Shopping Cart & Checkout: Allows users to add items to a cart and complete a purchase.\n\n**4. Test Strategy**\n\nThe smoke test suite will focus on validating the most critical functionalities to ensure the website is in a usable state. We'll use a simple, linear approach, prioritizing speed and stability.\n\n**5. Smoke Suite Definition**\n\nThis suite will contain three core tests:\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Website Availability and Homepage Load**\n    *   **Description:**  Verify the Wayfair website is accessible and the homepage loads successfully.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.wayfair.com.\n        2.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200 (OK).\n        3.  Verify the page title contains \"Wayfair\" (case-insensitive).\n    *   **Expected Result:** The website loads without errors, displaying the Wayfair homepage.\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Core Navigation - Menu Links**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the main menu links are present and navigable. Focus on the first 3 top-level menu items.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1. Navigate to https://www.wayfair.com.\n        2. Inspect the main navigation menu (typically located in the header).\n        3. For each of the first 3 top-level menu items:\n            *   Extract the link (href attribute).\n            *   Navigate to the extracted link.\n            *   Verify that the page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    *   **Expected Result:** All specified menu links are functional and lead to valid pages.\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Core Flow - \"A zillion things home\" and Shop Now Button**\n    *   **Description:** Verify core happy path as defined by the user story.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.wayfair.com.\n        2.  Locate the main hero section on the homepage.\n        3.  **Verify:** The hero headline contains the text \"A zillion things home\" (case-insensitive).\n        4.  Locate the \"Shop Now\" button within the hero section.\n        5.  Click the \"Shop Now\" button.\n        6.  Verify that the user is redirected to a relevant category page (e.g., a featured category or a general product listing page). This is verified by checking if the URL changes and contains a category keyword like \"furniture\", \"decor\" etc.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The headline text is correct, the \"Shop Now\" button is clickable, and navigation to a category page occurs.\n\n**6. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents**\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agents in efficiently exploring the website and identifying relevant elements for testing.\n\n*   **Homepage Mining:**\n    *   **Prioritize:**  Focus on the header, main hero section, and primary navigation elements.\n    *   **Extract:**\n        *   All `<a>` (link) tags within the header and main navigation.\n        *   The text content of the main hero headline (look for `<h1>` or `<h2>` tags within the hero section).\n        *   Locate the \"Shop Now\" button using text-based search (e.g., `button[text*='Shop Now']` or `a[text*='Shop Now']`).\n    *   **Rationale:** This area contains the core navigational elements and the target element of the user story.\n\n*   **General Mining Heuristics:**\n    *   **Element Identification:** Use a combination of CSS selectors, XPath expressions, and text-based searches to locate elements.  Prioritize robust selectors that are less likely to break due to minor UI changes.\n    *   **Dynamic Content Handling:** Be aware that Wayfair.com likely uses dynamic content loading.  Implement strategies to wait for elements to become visible or interactive before interacting with them (e.g., explicit waits).\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations (e.g., elements not found, network errors).  Log errors with sufficient detail to facilitate debugging.\n    *   **Prioritize visible elements:** Ensure the agent only interacts with elements that are currently visible on the page, taking into account scrolling and potential modal overlays.\n\n**7. Test Environment**\n\n*   **Browser:** Google Chrome (latest stable version)\n*   **Operating System:** Platform agnostic (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n**8. Test Data**\n\nThis smoke test suite does not require specific test data. It relies on the existing content and functionality of the Wayfair website.\n\n**9. Reporting**\n\n*   The autonomous agent should generate a clear and concise test report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n*   Include detailed error messages and screenshots for failed test cases.\n*   Report execution time for each test case.\n\n**10. Success/Failure Criteria**\n\n*   A successful smoke test suite requires all test cases to pass.\n*   If any test case fails, the build is considered unstable and requires further investigation.\n\n**11.  Maintenance**\n\nThis test plan and the associated automated tests will require ongoing maintenance to adapt to changes in the Wayfair.com website.  This includes:\n\n*   Updating element selectors and locators.\n*   Adjusting test steps to reflect changes in functionality.\n*   Adding new test cases as new features are introduced.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for autonomous agents to conduct effective smoke tests on Wayfair.com. By following these guidelines, the agents can efficiently validate the core functionality of the website and ensure a positive user experience. Remember to prioritize maintainability and adapt the plan as the website evolves."
