  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan designed to guide autonomous agents in performing smoke tests on One Medical's website (onemedical.com).\n\n# Master Test Plan: One Medical (onemedical.com) - Smoke Tests\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the smoke test plan for One Medical's website (https://www.onemedical.com). The goal of these smoke tests is to quickly verify the core functionality and availability of the website, ensuring a stable base for further, more in-depth testing.\n\n## 2. Domain Information\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.onemedical.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Healthcare - Primary Care Services\n*   **Website Purpose:**  The website serves as the primary interface for potential and existing patients to learn about One Medical's services, benefits of membership, locations, and to schedule appointments or manage their accounts. A key aspect is driving new member sign-ups.\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nThis test plan covers smoke tests only. It focuses on:\n\n*   Website availability.\n*   Basic navigation.\n*   A core user flow: Landing on the homepage, verifying key headline text, and initiating the \"Join Now\" process.\n\n## 4. Test Objectives\n\n*   Verify the website is accessible and loads correctly.\n*   Confirm core navigation links are functional.\n*   Validate the critical user flow of exploring the homepage and initiating membership signup works as expected.\n\n## 5. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThis smoke suite will contain the following tests:\n\n### 5.1. Test Case 1: Website Availability\n\n*   **Description:**  Verify that the One Medical website is accessible and returns a successful HTTP status code.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.onemedical.com.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The website loads successfully without any errors.\n    *   The HTTP status code is 200 (OK).\n\n### 5.2. Test Case 2: Core Navigation\n\n*   **Description:** Verify the main navigation menu links are functional.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.onemedical.com.\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu (likely in the header).\n    3.  Click on the following menu links: \"About Us\", \"Locations\", \"For Employers\", and \"Blog\".\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   Each menu link redirects to the correct corresponding page without errors.\n    *   The page content loads successfully for each link.\n\n### 5.3. Test Case 3: Happy Path - Homepage to Join Now\n\n*   **Description:** This test verifies the core user flow of landing on the homepage, validating the main headline, and initiating the \"Join Now\" process.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.onemedical.com.\n    2.  Verify the hero headline on the homepage contains the text \"Membership-based primary care\".\n    3.  Locate the \"Join Now\" button (or similar call to action button initiating the signup process).\n    4.  Click the \"Join Now\" button.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The hero headline contains the expected text.\n    *   The \"Join Now\" button is clickable and redirects the user to the membership signup page.\n    *   The membership signup page loads successfully.\n\n## 6. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents\n\nThe following instructions are designed to guide the autonomous agents in efficiently exploring the website and gathering necessary information for test execution and potential expansion of the test suite.\n\n*   **Prioritized Elements:**\n    *   **Homepage Hero Headline:**  Critical for verifying marketing messaging.  Agent should extract the text content and its CSS selector.\n    *   **Main Navigation Menu:**  Agent should identify all links within the main navigation (typically in the header). Extract the link text and the `href` attribute for each link.\n    *   **\"Join Now\" Button:** Agent should locate all buttons or links with text or labels containing \"Join Now\", \"Sign Up\", \"Become a Member,\" or similar phrases.  Extract the text, `href` attribute, and CSS selector.\n    *   **Footer Links:** Mine all links present in the footer of the page.\n\n*   **Prioritized Pages:**\n    *   **Homepage:**  The primary landing page. Focus on identifying key elements and calls to action.\n    *   **Locations Page:**  Important for users to find nearby One Medical offices.\n    *   **About Us Page:** Provides information about the company.\n\n*   **Mining Strategy:**\n    1.  **Start with the Homepage:** Begin the mining process on the homepage to identify key elements and navigation patterns.\n    2.  **Follow Navigation Links:**  Systematically follow links from the main navigation and footer to explore other important sections of the website.\n    3.  **Identify Forms:** Pay close attention to any forms present on the website (e.g., contact forms, appointment booking forms). These may require more in-depth testing in the future.\n\n## 7. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:**  Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.\n*   **Operating System:**  macOS, Windows, Linux.\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection.\n\n## 8. Test Data\n\n*   No specific test data is required for the smoke tests. The tests primarily focus on navigation and basic functionality.\n\n## 9. Reporting\n\n*   Any test failures should be reported immediately with detailed information, including:\n    *   Test case name and ID.\n    *   Steps to reproduce the failure.\n    *   Expected vs. Actual results.\n    *   Screenshots or videos of the failure.\n    *   Browser and operating system information.\n\n## 10. Success Criteria\n\n*   All smoke tests pass successfully, indicating that the core functionality of the website is working as expected.\n\n## 11. Out of Scope\n\n*   Detailed functional testing of individual features.\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (beyond the specified browsers).\n*   Mobile testing.\n\n## 12. Future Considerations\n\n*   Based on the results of these smoke tests and the information mined by the autonomous agents, a more comprehensive test plan can be developed to cover functional, performance, and security testing.  This plan should include detailed test cases for all key features and user flows.  The mined data can be used to create data-driven tests and to identify potential areas of risk."
