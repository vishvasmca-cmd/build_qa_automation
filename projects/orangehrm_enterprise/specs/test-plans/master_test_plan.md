# Test Plan: OrangeHRM Enterprise

## Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the OrangeHRM Enterprise application, focusing on smoke and regression testing.

## Scope

The scope of testing includes:

*   Login functionality
*   PIM (Personal Information Management) module - Employee creation
*   Admin module - User Management - System User creation

## Test Strategy

We will employ a risk-based testing approach, prioritizing critical functionalities for smoke testing and a broader range of scenarios for regression testing.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite will focus on verifying the core functionalities of the application. The following 8-point checklist has been applied to determine the smoke test cases:

1.  **Critical Path:** Does this functionality represent a primary user journey?
2.  **Core Business Logic:** Is this functionality essential for the application's core purpose?
3.  **High Impact:** Would a failure in this area severely impact users?
4.  **Frequency of Use:** Is this functionality used frequently by a majority of users?
5.  **Recent Changes:** Has this area been recently modified or updated?
6.  **Integration Points:** Does this functionality interact with other critical modules?
7.  **Data Integrity:** Is the data generated by this functionality critical for reporting or other processes?
8.  **Security:** Does this functionality involve authentication or authorization?

Based on this checklist, the following scenarios are included in the smoke suite:

*   Successful Login
*   Add a new employee in PIM Module
*   Create a System User in Admin Module

### Regression Suite Strategy

The regression suite will cover a wider range of scenarios, including alternative flows, negative testing, and edge cases.  This suite will ensure that new changes have not introduced defects into existing functionalities.

## Test Suites

1.  **Smoke Suite:**
    *   Objective: Verify critical functionalities.
    *   Frequency: Executed with every build.
    *   Environment: Staging

2.  **Regression Suite:**
    *   Objective: Ensure existing functionalities are not broken.
    *   Frequency: Executed after code changes and before releases.
    *   Environment: Staging

## Test Environment

*   Browser: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
*   Operating System: Windows, macOS, Linux

## Test Data

Test data will be created and managed to ensure consistent and reliable test results.  This includes valid and invalid data for input fields.

## Test Deliverables

*   Test Plan
*   Test Cases (Gherkin Feature Files)
*   Test Execution Reports
*   Defect Reports
