  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Onboarding Flow\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** OrangeHRM (opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)\n**Business Domain:** Enterprise HR\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a critical onboarding flow within the OrangeHRM application. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, ensuring a consistent and comprehensive approach to testing.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe target application is an Enterprise HR system. The specified onboarding flow is a critical business process. Failure in this area can lead to:\n\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect or incomplete employee records.\n*   **Compliance Risks:** Failure to adhere to HR regulations.\n*   **Operational Inefficiency:** Delays in onboarding new employees.\n*   **Employee Dissatisfaction:** A frustrating onboarding experience.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nThe risk profile for this onboarding flow is considered **High**. A failure in this area can have significant operational and reputational consequences.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Successful login to the application.\n*   Navigation to the PIM (Personal Information Management) module.\n*   Creation of a new employee record with valid data.\n*   Saving the new employee record.\n*   Navigation to the Admin module.\n*   Navigation to User Management -> Users.\n*   Creation of a new system user associated with the newly created employee.\n*   Verification of successful user creation.\n*   Negative testing of input fields (e.g., invalid characters, exceeding length limits).\n*   Edge cases related to data constraints (e.g., duplicate usernames).\n*   Security testing of input fields (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).\n*   Testing with different browser types and versions.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, etc.).\n*   Localization testing.\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Integration with external systems (e.g., payroll, benefits).\n*   Detailed reporting functionality.\n*   All other modules and functionalities outside the specified onboarding flow.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the absolute minimum required to verify the application is generally functional.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Login Success**\n    *   Steps: Navigate to the login page, enter valid credentials, and click \"Login\".\n    *   Verification: User is successfully logged in and redirected to the dashboard.\n*   **Test Case 2: PIM Module Load**\n    *   Steps: Navigate to the PIM module.\n    *   Verification: The PIM module page loads successfully without errors.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will cover a comprehensive set of tests to ensure the onboarding flow functions correctly under various conditions.\n\n*   **Positive Testing:**\n    *   Create a new employee with valid data in all fields.\n    *   Create a system user with valid data, associated with the new employee.\n    *   Verify the new employee and user are successfully created and visible in their respective lists.\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Attempt to create an employee with invalid data (e.g., special characters in name fields, exceeding field length limits).\n    *   Attempt to create a system user with an invalid username (e.g., already exists, invalid characters).\n    *   Attempt to create a system user without associating it with an employee.\n    *   Attempt to save the employee record with missing required fields.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users creating employees simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures: Simulate network interruptions during employee creation.\n    *   Empty states: Verify the application handles empty lists gracefully (e.g., no employees found).\n    *   Boundary Analysis: Test with maximum allowed lengths for all input fields.\n*   **Security Testing:**\n    *   Input field validation: Sanitize all input fields to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.\n    *   Authentication: Verify secure authentication mechanisms are in place.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Use a data generation library (e.g., Faker) to create realistic and unique test data for each test run. This will prevent data conflicts and ensure test repeatability.\n    *   **Data Cleanup:** Implement a mechanism to clean up test data after each test run to maintain data integrity.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page or component of the application as a separate class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Example: `LoginPage.java`, `PIMPage.java`, `AddEmployeePage.java`, `AdminUsersPage.java`\n*   **Test Framework:** JUnit or TestNG.\n*   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ (for fluent assertions).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement a mechanism to automatically retry failed tests or steps.  Consider using try-catch blocks with retry logic for common failure points.\n*   **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to capture detailed information about test execution, including errors, warnings, and debug messages.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login`\n2.  **PIM Module:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/pim/viewPimModule`\n3.  **Add Employee Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/pim/addEmployee`\n4.  **Admin Module -> User Management -> Users:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/viewSystemUsers`\n5.  **Add User Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/saveSystemUser`\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Login:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Dashboard\" text visible on the page.\n*   **Page Load Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND relevant page title or heading is visible.\n*   **Employee Creation Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND success message displayed AND the new employee is visible in the employee list.\n*   **User Creation Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND success message displayed AND the new user is visible in the user list.\n*   **Error Handling:** Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input AND the application does not crash.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated as needed to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the business and the application."
