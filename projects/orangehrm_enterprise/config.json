  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Onboarding Flow\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** OrangeHRM (opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)\n**Business Domain:** Enterprise HR\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the critical \"Onboarding New Employee and Creating System User\" flow within the OrangeHRM application. This strategy will guide all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimizing risks associated with this core business process.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe target application is an Enterprise HR system. The \"Onboarding New Employee and Creating System User\" flow is a **P0** (Priority 0) business process. Failure in this area directly impacts the ability to manage employees, assign roles, and maintain system security.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the onboarding flow can lead to:\n\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect or incomplete employee data.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Inability to properly manage user access and permissions.\n*   **Operational Disruptions:** Delays in onboarding new employees, impacting productivity.\n*   **Compliance Issues:** Potential violations of data privacy regulations if employee data is not handled correctly.\n*   **Financial Loss:** Indirectly, through decreased productivity and potential legal ramifications.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust in the HR system's reliability.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Successful employee onboarding (all required fields, valid data).\n*   System user creation for the new employee.\n*   Navigation between modules (PIM, Admin, User Management).\n*   Data validation at each step of the process.\n*   Error handling for invalid data inputs.\n*   Security checks (input validation to prevent basic XSS/SQLi).\n*   Role-based access control (ensure the correct roles are assigned).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   Positive and negative testing of all input fields.\n*   Boundary value analysis for numeric and date fields.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n*   Integration with external systems (e.g., payroll, benefits).\n*   Localization testing (different languages).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Detailed reporting functionality.\n*   Workflow approval processes (if any exist beyond basic saving).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the absolute minimum required to verify the system is operational.\n\n*   **Login:** Successful login with valid credentials.\n*   **PIM Module Load:** Verify the PIM module loads without errors.\n*   **Admin Module Load:** Verify the Admin module loads without errors.\n\n**Goal:** Ensure basic system functionality is available. If these tests fail, the build is rejected.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the onboarding flow.\n\n*   **Positive Onboarding:**\n    *   Create a new employee with all required fields filled correctly.\n    *   Verify the employee is created successfully and visible in the employee list.\n    *   Navigate to Admin -> User Management -> Users.\n    *   Create a system user for the newly created employee.\n    *   Verify the system user is created successfully and visible in the user list.\n    *   Verify the new user can log in with the created credentials.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Attempt to create an employee with missing required fields.\n    *   Attempt to create an employee with invalid data (e.g., invalid email format, special characters in name fields, future date of birth).\n    *   Attempt to create a system user with an existing username.\n    *   Attempt to create a system user with an invalid password (e.g., too short, missing special characters).\n    *   Attempt to create an employee with duplicate employee ID.\n    *   Attempt to save the form with JavaScript disabled.\n    *   Attempt to create a user with a role that the logged-in user does not have permission to assign.\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users attempting to create employees simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures: Simulate network interruptions during the onboarding process.\n    *   Empty states: Verify appropriate messages are displayed when lists are empty.\n    *   Large datasets: Test with a large number of employees already in the system.\n    *   Long names: Test with very long first and last names to check field length limits.\n\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input validation: Verify that all input fields are properly sanitized to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.\n    *   Password complexity: Enforce strong password policies for system users.\n    *   Role-based access control: Ensure that users can only access and modify data that they are authorized to.\n\n*   **Data Validation:**\n    *   Verify that data is saved correctly in the database.\n    *   Verify that data is displayed correctly in the UI.\n    *   Verify that data is consistent across different modules.\n\n*   **Boundary Analysis:**\n    *   Test minimum and maximum values for numeric fields (e.g., employee ID).\n    *   Test date fields with dates in the past and future.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Dynamic Generation:** Use dynamic data generation for employee names, usernames, and passwords to avoid conflicts and ensure uniqueness.  Libraries like Faker.js or similar should be used.\n*   **Data Cleanup:** Implement a mechanism to clean up test data after each test run to maintain a clean testing environment.  This could involve deleting the created employee and user.\n*   **Data Security:** Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is handled securely and not stored in plain text.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page or component of the application. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Language:** [Choose a language like Java, Python, or JavaScript based on team expertise and project requirements].\n*   **Test Framework:** [Choose a test framework like JUnit, pytest, or Mocha based on the chosen language].\n*   **Assertion Library:** [Choose an assertion library like AssertJ, Chai, or Hamcrest based on the chosen language].\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met. This will help to reduce flakiness caused by asynchronous operations.  Example: Wait for a success message to appear after saving an employee.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically recover from common errors, such as stale element references.  This could involve retrying the action or refreshing the page.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests. This will help to reduce flakiness caused by intermittent issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login`\n2.  **PIM -> Add Employee:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/pim/addEmployee`\n3.  **Admin -> User Management -> Users:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/viewSystemUsers`\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Login:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Dashboard\" text visible.\n*   **Employee Creation:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Successfully Saved\" message visible AND the new employee is present in the employee list.\n*   **User Creation:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Successfully Saved\" message visible AND the new user is present in the user list.\n*   **Error Handling:** Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n*   **Data Integrity:** Data is saved correctly in the database and displayed correctly in the UI.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the critical onboarding flow in OrangeHRM. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure that the system is reliable, secure, and meets the needs of the business."
