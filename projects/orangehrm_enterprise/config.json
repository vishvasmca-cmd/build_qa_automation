  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Onboarding Flow\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** OrangeHRM (opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)\n**Business Domain:** Enterprise HR\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nOrangeHRM is a Human Resources Management (HRM) system. The core business functions revolve around employee management, payroll, and related HR processes. The specified user goal focuses on a critical onboarding flow: adding a new employee and creating a system user account.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure in the onboarding flow can lead to:\n\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect or incomplete employee records.\n*   **Access Control Problems:** Inability for new employees to access necessary systems.\n*   **Compliance Risks:** Potential violations of data privacy regulations if employee data is mishandled.\n*   **Operational Delays:** Hindrance to HR processes and employee productivity.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust if the system is unreliable.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Login functionality.\n*   Navigation to the PIM (Personal Information Management) module.\n*   Adding a new employee with valid data.\n*   Saving the new employee record.\n*   Navigation to the Admin module.\n*   User Management functionality.\n*   Creating a system user for the newly created employee.\n*   Verification of successful employee creation and user account setup.\n*   Negative testing related to data validation during employee creation and user creation.\n*   Role-based access control (RBAC) testing for the newly created user.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Other modules within OrangeHRM (e.g., Leave, Time, Recruitment).\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Load testing.\n*   Detailed security testing beyond basic input validation.\n*   Integration with external systems (if any).\n*   Localization testing.\n*   Accessibility testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will verify the basic health of the application and the core onboarding functionality.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Login Success**\n    *   Steps: Navigate to the login page, enter valid credentials, and click \"Login.\"\n    *   Verification: Successful login and redirection to the dashboard.\n*   **Test Case 2: Add Employee Page Load**\n    *   Steps: Login, navigate to PIM -> Add Employee.\n    *   Verification: The \"Add Employee\" page loads successfully without errors.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will cover various scenarios related to the onboarding flow, including positive and negative cases.\n\n*   **Positive Flow (Happy Path):**\n    *   Login with valid credentials.\n    *   Navigate to PIM -> Add Employee.\n    *   Enter valid data for all required fields (FirstNameTest, LastNameTest).\n    *   Click \"Save.\"\n    *   Navigate to Admin -> User Management -> Users.\n    *   Click \"Add.\"\n    *   Select the newly created employee (FirstNameTest LastNameTest) from the \"Employee Name\" dropdown.\n    *   Enter valid username and password.\n    *   Select a user role.\n    *   Select a status.\n    *   Click \"Save.\"\n    *   Verification:\n        *   Employee is successfully added to the PIM module.\n        *   User account is successfully created in the Admin module.\n        *   The new user can log in with the created credentials.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Login:**\n        *   Invalid username.\n        *   Invalid password.\n        *   Empty username.\n        *   Empty password.\n    *   **Add Employee:**\n        *   Missing required fields (First Name, Last Name).\n        *   Invalid characters in First Name/Last Name (e.g., special characters, numbers).\n        *   Exceeding maximum length for First Name/Last Name.\n        *   Attempting to save without filling required fields.\n        *   Duplicate Employee ID (if applicable).\n    *   **Create User:**\n        *   Missing required fields (Username, Password, Employee Name).\n        *   Invalid username format (e.g., special characters).\n        *   Weak password (e.g., too short, common password).\n        *   Username already exists.\n        *   Selecting an inactive employee.\n        *   Selecting an invalid user role.\n        *   Attempting to save without selecting an employee.\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding employees simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures during the onboarding process.\n    *   Database connection issues.\n    *   Large number of employees already in the system.\n    *   Special characters in employee names and usernames.\n\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input validation to prevent XSS attacks in all input fields (First Name, Last Name, Username, Password).\n    *   Password complexity requirements.\n    *   Proper handling of sensitive data (e.g., encryption of passwords).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  A set of valid usernames and passwords for existing admin users.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Employee names (FirstNameTest, LastNameTest) will be dynamically generated to avoid conflicts.  Consider using timestamps or random number generation to ensure uniqueness. Usernames should also be dynamically generated.\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   Test data should be stored securely and managed centrally.\n    *   A mechanism for cleaning up test data after test execution should be implemented to avoid cluttering the system.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page or component of the application as a separate class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Example: `LoginPage`, `AddEmployeePage`, `UserManagementPage`.\n*   **Test Framework:**  Choose a suitable test framework (e.g., Selenium WebDriver with JUnit/TestNG, Cypress, Playwright) based on the team's expertise and project requirements.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures, such as:\n    *   Retrying failed assertions.\n    *   Refreshing the page.\n    *   Re-logging in.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid using implicit waits, as they can lead to unpredictable behavior. Use explicit waits to wait for specific elements or conditions.\n*   **Robust Locators:** Use robust locators (e.g., IDs, CSS selectors) that are less likely to change. Avoid using XPath locators that are based on element position.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  Focus on different login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials).\n2.  **PIM -> Add Employee:**  Explore different combinations of input data for employee creation.\n3.  **Admin -> User Management -> Users -> Add:** Explore different user roles, statuses, and employee selections.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Criteria:**\n    *   All test cases in the smoke and regression suites pass.\n    *   No critical errors or exceptions are encountered during test execution.\n    *   The application behaves as expected under various conditions (e.g., network failures, invalid input).\n*   **Specific Verification:**\n    *   **Login:** Successful login redirects to the dashboard with a \"Welcome\" message. HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Add Employee:**  The new employee is visible in the employee list.  HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Create User:** The new user is visible in the user list. The new user can log in with the created credentials. HTTP 200 status code.\n*   **Reporting:**  Detailed test reports should be generated after each test execution, including information about passed, failed, and skipped tests."
