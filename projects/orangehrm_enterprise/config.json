  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Onboarding Flow\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** OrangeHRM (opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)\n**Business Domain:** Enterprise Human Resources (HR)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a critical onboarding flow within the OrangeHRM application. This strategy will guide all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage, efficient execution, and minimal risk.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nThe OrangeHRM application operates within the Enterprise HR domain. This domain is crucial for managing employee data, payroll, benefits, and other HR-related functions. The target onboarding flow is particularly important because it directly impacts the organization's ability to efficiently manage its workforce. Delays or errors in onboarding can lead to:\n\n*   **Compliance Issues:** Incorrect or incomplete employee data can lead to legal and regulatory compliance problems.\n*   **Operational Inefficiency:** Difficulty in accessing or managing employee information can hinder HR operations.\n*   **Employee Dissatisfaction:** A flawed onboarding process can create a negative first impression for new employees.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure in the onboarding flow can result in:\n\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect employee information.\n*   **Security Risks:** Inadequate user access controls.\n*   **Operational Delays:** Inability to onboard employees promptly.\n*   **Financial Loss:** Potential fines for non-compliance.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust due to data breaches or operational inefficiencies.\n\n**Risk Severity:** High\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Successful login to the application.\n*   Navigation to the PIM (Personal Information Management) module.\n*   Adding a new employee with valid data (\"FirstNameTest LastNameTest\").\n*   Saving the new employee's information.\n*   Navigation to the Admin module.\n*   Navigation to User Management -> Users.\n*   Creating a System User account for the newly created employee.\n*   Validating the successful completion of each step.\n*   Negative testing of input fields in all steps (e.g., invalid characters, exceeding length limits).\n*   Role-based access control when creating the system user. (e.g. Can the newly provisioned user access the system?)\n*   UI testing of the forms and page elements related to the onboarding flow.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility of the workflow. (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)\n*   Verification of confirmation messages after successful operations.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, etc.) - Covered by a separate test strategy.\n*   Integration with external systems (e.g., payroll, benefits) - Covered by separate test strategies.\n*   Detailed reporting functionality testing (beyond basic confirmation).\n*   Full localization testing (beyond basic character set support).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThis suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure basic functionality is working.\n\n*   **Test Case 1:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify successful login to the application with valid credentials.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Open the application URL.\n        2.  Enter valid username and password.\n        3.  Click the \"Login\" button.\n        4.  Verify that the user is redirected to the dashboard.\n*   **Test Case 2:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify Navigation to PIM page after successful login\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  From the dashboard, navigate to the PIM module.\n        2.  Verify that the PIM page loads successfully.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThis suite will be executed to ensure that changes have not broken existing functionality, with focus on the onboarding flow.\n\n*   **Positive Testing:**\n    *   Complete the entire onboarding flow with valid data as described in the User Goal.\n    *   Verify successful creation of the employee and user account.\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Login:** Attempt login with invalid credentials (invalid username, invalid password, both invalid).\n    *   **PIM Module:**\n        *   Attempt to create an employee with missing required fields (e.g., FirstName, LastName).\n        *   Attempt to create an employee with invalid data in fields (e.g., special characters in name fields, exceeding field length limits).\n        *   Attempt to save the employee without filling all mandatory details.\n    *   **Admin Module / User Management:**\n        *   Attempt to create a user account with missing required fields (e.g., username, password).\n        *   Attempt to create a user account with invalid data in fields (e.g., weak password, invalid characters in username).\n        *   Attempt to create a user with existing username.\n        *   Attempt to assign invalid Roles or Statuses to a new System User.\n    *   **Boundary Testing:**\n        *   Test the maximum allowed length of input fields (e.g., name fields, username, password).\n        *   Test minimum password length restrictions.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   **Concurrency:** Simulate multiple users creating employees simultaneously to check for data conflicts.\n    *   **Network Failures:** Simulate network interruptions during the onboarding process to ensure data integrity (e.g., what happens if the network drops DURING the save?).\n    *   **Empty States:** Test the application's behavior when there are no employees or users in the system.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   **Input Validation:** Check for basic SQL injection vulnerabilities and XSS vulnerabilities in all input fields by entering malicious code.\n    *   **Access Control:** Verify that unauthorized users cannot access the Admin module or create user accounts.\n    *   **Password Policies:** Verify that the application enforces strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, special characters).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Use dynamic data generation techniques (e.g., Faker library) to create unique employee and user data for each test run. This avoids data conflicts and ensures test repeatability.\n    *   **Data Cleanup:** Implement mechanisms to clean up test data after each test run to maintain data integrity and avoid clutter.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n*   Implement the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern. This will improve code maintainability, reduce code duplication, and enhance test readability.\n    *   **LoginPage:** Contains elements and methods related to the login page.\n    *   **PIMPage:** Contains elements and methods related to the PIM module.\n    *   **AddEmployeePage:** Contains elements and methods related to the \"Add Employee\" form.\n    *   **AdminPage:** Contains elements and methods related to the Admin module.\n    *   **UserManagementPage:** Contains elements and methods related to the User Management section.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with reasonable timeouts to handle asynchronous operations and UI updates. This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues. Example: Wait for a success message to appear before proceeding.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures, such as stale element references or element not found exceptions. This can involve refreshing the page, re-locating elements, or retrying actions.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a certain number of times before marking it as failed.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded and interactable before performing actions.\n*   **Screenshots & Video Recordings:** Configure tests to automatically capture screenshots and/or video recordings of failing tests to aid in debugging and root cause analysis.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Order of priority)\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages/flows first:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** Explore different login scenarios (valid credentials, invalid credentials, missing fields).\n2.  **PIM Module / Add Employee:** Explore all input fields in the \"Add Employee\" form with various data types and lengths.\n3.  **Admin Module / User Management / Add User:** Explore all input fields in the \"Add User\" form with various data types and lengths.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\nSuccess is defined by:\n\n*   **HTTP 200 OK:** Successful HTTP responses for all page requests.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Key elements on each page are visible and interactable (e.g., Login button, Add Employee button, Save button).\n*   **Success Messages:** Confirmation messages are displayed after successful operations (e.g., \"Employee Created Successfully\", \"User Created Successfully\").\n*   **Data Persistence:** Data is correctly saved in the database and displayed in the UI (e.g., newly created employee is visible in the employee list).\n*   **No Critical Errors:** No critical JavaScript errors or exceptions are thrown during the onboarding flow.\n*   **User Access:** Newly created users can successfully login to the system.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the onboarding flow within the OrangeHRM application. By following this strategy, the testing team can ensure high-quality testing, reduce risks, and improve the overall quality of the application."
