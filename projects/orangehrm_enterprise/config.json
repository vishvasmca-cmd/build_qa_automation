  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Employee Onboarding\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** OrangeHRM (opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)\n**Business Domain:** Enterprise HR\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for ensuring the quality and reliability of the OrangeHRM application, specifically focusing on the critical employee onboarding process. This strategy will guide all testing activities, including manual and automated testing efforts.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n**1.1 Domain Analysis:**\n\nOrangeHRM is a Human Resources Management (HRM) system. The employee onboarding process is a critical function, directly impacting HR operations, data integrity, and employee experience. Errors in this process can lead to incorrect employee records, payroll issues, compliance violations, and decreased employee satisfaction.\n\n**1.2 Risk Profile:**\n\n*   **High Risk:** Failure of the employee onboarding process can result in:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect salary calculations, benefits enrollment errors.\n    *   **Data Breach:** Security vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized access to employee data.\n    *   **Compliance Violations:** Failure to adhere to labor laws and regulations.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust in the HR system and the organization.\n    *   **Operational Disruption:** Delays in onboarding new employees, impacting productivity.\n\n**1.3 Testing Scope:**\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Login functionality.\n    *   Navigation to the PIM (Personal Information Management) module.\n    *   Adding a new employee with valid data.\n    *   Saving employee information.\n    *   Navigation to the Admin module.\n    *   User Management functionality.\n    *   Creating a new system user for the newly created employee.\n    *   Data validation across all modules involved.\n    *   Security testing related to user authentication and authorization.\n    *   Error handling and validation messages.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n    *   Performance testing (response times for key actions).\n\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Detailed testing of all other OrangeHRM modules not directly involved in the onboarding process.\n    *   Integration with external systems (e.g., payroll, benefits providers) \u2013 unless specifically required for the onboarding flow.\n    *   Load testing beyond basic performance checks.\n    *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) \u2013 to be addressed in a separate testing phase.\n    *   Mobile testing (unless specifically required).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n**2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n*   **Purpose:** Verify the core functionality of the application is operational after deployment or code changes.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Successful Login with valid credentials.\n    2.  Successful navigation to the PIM module.\n    3.  Successful navigation to the Admin module.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All smoke tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n**2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n\n*   **Purpose:** Ensure that new changes have not introduced defects into existing functionality, specifically the employee onboarding process.\n*   **Test Areas:**\n    *   **Positive Testing:**\n        *   Add new employee with all required fields populated correctly.\n        *   Create a system user for the new employee with valid credentials and roles.\n        *   Verify data consistency across PIM and Admin modules.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Attempt to add an employee with invalid data (e.g., special characters in name, invalid date format).\n        *   Attempt to create a system user with invalid credentials (e.g., weak password, existing username).\n        *   Attempt to add an employee with missing required fields.\n        *   Attempt to create a user with a role that does not have sufficient permissions.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Add an employee with very long names or addresses.\n        *   Add an employee with special characters in their name or address.\n        *   Concurrent user creation (multiple users adding employees simultaneously).\n        *   Network failures during the onboarding process.\n        *   Database connection issues.\n    *   **Security Testing:**\n        *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n        *   Authentication and authorization checks to ensure users can only access authorized resources.\n        *   Password complexity requirements.\n    *   **Data Validation:**\n        *   Verify that data is stored correctly in the database.\n        *   Verify that data is displayed correctly in the UI.\n        *   Verify that data is consistent across different modules.\n\n**2.3 Data Strategy:**\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined sets of valid and invalid data for common fields (e.g., valid and invalid email addresses, phone numbers).\n    *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Use of data generation tools or scripts to create unique employee names, usernames, and passwords. This is crucial for avoiding conflicts and ensuring test repeatability.\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   Test data should be stored in a secure and accessible location.\n    *   Test data should be regularly refreshed to avoid stale data issues.\n    *   Sensitive data (e.g., passwords) should be encrypted.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n**3.1 Framework Recommendation:**\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page or component of the application as a separate class. This will improve code maintainability, reusability, and readability.\n*   **Technology Stack:**\n    *   **Programming Language:** Java or Python (based on team expertise).\n    *   **Test Automation Framework:** Selenium WebDriver.\n    *   **Assertion Library:** JUnit or pytest.\n    *   **Reporting:** Allure or similar reporting tool.\n\n**3.2 Resilience Strategy:**\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable before performing actions.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically retry failed tests or recover from common errors (e.g., element not found).\n*   **Test Environment Stability:**\n    *   Ensure a stable and dedicated test environment.\n    *   Regularly monitor the test environment for issues.\n    *   Implement automated environment setup and teardown procedures.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n**4.1 Mining Targets:**\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login`\n2.  **PIM -> Add Employee:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/pim/addEmployee`\n3.  **Admin -> User Management -> Users:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/viewSystemUsers`\n\n**4.2 Verification Criteria:**\n\n*   **Login Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   \"Dashboard\" text visible on the page.\n*   **Add Employee Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   Confirmation message displayed (e.g., \"Successfully Saved\").\n    *   Employee record visible in the employee list.\n*   **Create User Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   Confirmation message displayed (e.g., \"Successfully Saved\").\n    *   New user visible in the user list.\n*   **General Success:**\n    *   No unhandled exceptions or errors in the application logs.\n    *   No broken links or images on the page.\n    *   Page load times within acceptable limits (e.g., < 3 seconds).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the quality and reliability of the OrangeHRM employee onboarding process. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can effectively identify and mitigate risks, deliver a high-quality product, and ensure a positive user experience."
