The core business functions revolve around employee management, payroll, time tracking, and related HR processes.  The onboarding flow (adding a new employee and creating a system user) is a critical function, impacting HR efficiency and data integrity.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure in the onboarding flow can lead to:\n\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect or incomplete employee data.\n*   **Access Control Problems:** Inability to grant appropriate system access to new employees.\n*   **Operational Inefficiency:** Delays in onboarding, impacting HR productivity.\n*   **Compliance Risks:** Potential non-compliance with data privacy regulations if employee data is mishandled.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Successful login to the system.\n*   Navigation to the PIM (Personal Information Management) module.\n*   Adding a new employee with valid data.\n*   Saving the new employee record.\n*   Navigation to the Admin module.\n*   Navigation to User Management -> Users.\n*   Creating a system user for the newly created employee.\n*   Verification of successful user creation.\n*   Negative testing scenarios related to data validation during employee creation and user creation.\n*   Security testing for basic input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, etc.).\n*   Detailed security penetration testing.\n*   Localization testing.\n*   Integration with external systems (e.g., payroll).\n*   All other modules and functionalities of OrangeHRM outside the specified onboarding flow.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the following minimal tests:\n\n1.  **Login:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n2.  **PIM Navigation:** Verify successful navigation to the PIM module.\n3.  **Admin Navigation:** Verify successful navigation to the Admin module.\n\nThese tests must pass for a build to be considered stable enough for further testing.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will cover the following scenarios:\n\n*   **Positive Flow:**\n    1.  Login with valid credentials.\n    2.  Navigate to PIM -> Add Employee.\n    3.  Enter valid data for all required fields (First Name, Last Name).\n    4.  Click Save.\n    5.  Navigate to Admin -> User Management -> Users.\n    6.  Click Add.\n    7.  Select the newly created employee.\n    8.  Enter valid username and password.\n    9.  Select User Role.\n    10. Select Status.\n    11. Click Save.\n    12. Verify user is created successfully.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Login:** Invalid username/password combinations, blank fields.\n    *   **Add Employee:**\n        *   Missing required fields (First Name, Last Name).\n        *   Invalid data types (e.g., non-numeric values in numeric fields).\n        *   Exceeding maximum field lengths.\n        *   Special characters in name fields.\n    *   **Create User:**\n        *   Invalid username/password formats (e.g., too short, special characters).\n        *   Username already exists.\n        *   Missing required fields.\n        *   Selecting an inactive employee.\n        *   Attempting to create a user with the same username as an existing user.\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users attempting to create the same employee simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures during data submission.\n    *   Empty states: Handling scenarios where no employees or users exist.\n\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input validation: Sanitize all input fields to prevent basic SQL injection and XSS attacks.  Specifically, test for:\n        *   Single quotes (') in name fields.\n        *   HTML tags in name fields.\n        *   Long strings to test buffer overflows.\n\n*   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n    *   Verify that the newly created employee appears correctly in the employee list within the PIM module.\n    *   Verify that the newly created user can successfully log in to the system.\n\n*   **Validation Messages:**\n    *   Verify that appropriate and user-friendly error messages are displayed for all negative test scenarios.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  A set of predefined usernames and passwords for initial login and admin access.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Employee names and user credentials will be dynamically generated to avoid conflicts and ensure uniqueness.  Consider using a library like Faker to generate realistic-looking data.  The generated data should be stored (e.g., in a CSV file or database) for auditing and debugging purposes.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page or component of the application. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.  Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous operations and potential delays in UI updates.  Avoid hard-coded waits.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically retry failed actions or locate elements that may have changed slightly.  This could involve re-locating elements or refreshing the page.\n    *   **Retry Logic:** Implement retry logic for common operations like clicking buttons or entering text, especially in areas prone to intermittent failures.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages/flows first:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login`\n2.  **PIM -> Add Employee:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/pim/addEmployee`\n3.  **Admin -> User Management -> Users -> Add:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/saveSystemUser`\n\nThese are the core pages involved in the onboarding flow and should be prioritized for exploration and test case generation.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Login Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND presence of the \"Dashboard\" element on the page.\n*   **Employee Creation Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND redirection to the employee details page AND presence of the employee's name in the \"Personal Details\" section.\n*   **User Creation Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND the newly created user appears in the user list table AND a success message is displayed.\n*   **Negative Test Success:** Appropriate error messages are displayed on the UI AND the system prevents the invalid data from being saved.\n\n```\n"
