  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Onboarding Flow\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** OrangeHRM (opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)\n**Business Domain:** Enterprise HR\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the critical \"Onboarding Flow\" within the OrangeHRM application. This strategy will guide all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimizing risks associated with software releases.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe OrangeHRM application falls within the Enterprise HR domain. The \"Onboarding Flow\" (adding a new employee and creating a system user) is a **P0** (Priority 0) business-critical function. Failure in this area directly impacts the organization's ability to manage its workforce, potentially leading to:\n\n*   **Compliance Issues:** Incorrect or incomplete employee data can lead to legal and regulatory violations.\n*   **Operational Inefficiency:** Delays in onboarding hinder productivity and impact time-to-value for new hires.\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Inaccurate employee records can affect payroll, benefits administration, and reporting.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nThe risk profile for the Onboarding Flow is **High**. A failure in this area can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Due to compliance penalties, payroll errors, or inefficient operations.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative impact on employee morale and employer branding.\n*   **Data Breach:** Potential for sensitive employee data to be compromised if security vulnerabilities exist.\n*   **System Instability:** Onboarding process failures can cascade into other HR modules.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Successful onboarding of a new employee with valid data.\n*   Creation of a system user account for the newly onboarded employee.\n*   Positive and negative testing of all input fields (First Name, Last Name, User Role, etc.).\n*   Validation of data persistence across modules (e.g., employee data visible in PIM and Admin modules).\n*   Security testing of input fields to prevent common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi).\n*   Error handling and user feedback mechanisms (e.g., clear error messages for invalid input).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   Regression testing of existing functionality impacted by changes to the Onboarding Flow.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, and endurance).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Localization testing (internationalization).\n*   Integration with external systems (e.g., payroll, benefits providers) - unless specifically impacted by changes.\n*   Detailed reporting module testing (beyond basic data verification).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will consist of the following minimal set of tests to verify the core functionality:\n\n1.  **Login:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n2.  **PIM Navigation:** Verify successful navigation to the PIM module.\n3.  **Add Employee Page Load:** Verify the \"Add Employee\" page loads successfully.\n4.  **Admin Navigation:** Verify successful navigation to the Admin module.\n5.  **User Management Navigation:** Verify successful navigation to the User Management -> Users page.\n\n**Success Criteria:** All tests must pass with no errors.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the Onboarding Flow, including:\n\n*   **Positive Onboarding Flow:**\n    *   Successfully add a new employee with valid data (First Name, Last Name, etc.).\n    *   Successfully create a system user for the new employee with valid data (Username, Password, User Role, etc.).\n    *   Verify employee data is correctly displayed in the PIM module.\n    *   Verify the new user is listed in the Admin -> User Management -> Users page.\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid input in First Name and Last Name fields (e.g., special characters, numbers, exceeding maximum length).\n    *   Missing required fields (e.g., leaving First Name or Last Name blank).\n    *   Invalid Username format (e.g., special characters, exceeding maximum length).\n    *   Weak Password (e.g., not meeting complexity requirements).\n    *   Duplicate Username (attempting to create a user with an existing username).\n    *   Invalid User Role selection.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users attempting to onboard employees simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures during the onboarding process (simulating network interruptions).\n    *   Empty states: Handling scenarios where no employees or users exist.\n    *   Boundary Analysis: Testing maximum length limits for input fields.\n*   **Security Testing:**\n    *   Input validation to prevent XSS attacks (e.g., injecting JavaScript code into input fields).\n    *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks (e.g., injecting SQL code into input fields).\n    *   Password complexity requirements enforcement.\n*   **Data Validation:**\n    *   Verify data persistence across modules (PIM and Admin).\n    *   Verify data integrity after updates or modifications.\n*   **Error Handling:**\n    *   Verify clear and informative error messages are displayed for invalid input.\n    *   Verify appropriate error handling for network failures and other unexpected events.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Use dynamic data generation for employee names, usernames, and passwords to avoid conflicts and ensure test data uniqueness.  Libraries like Faker.js or similar can be used.\n*   **Data Cleanup:** Implement a mechanism to clean up test data after test execution to maintain a clean testing environment.  This could involve deleting the created employee and user accounts.\n*   **Data Masking:** If using production-like data for testing, ensure sensitive data is masked or anonymized to protect privacy.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page or component of the application as a separate class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and reduces code duplication.\n*   **Test Automation Framework:** Choose a robust test automation framework (e.g., Selenium with Java/Python/C#, Cypress, Playwright) that supports POM and provides features for test execution, reporting, and data management.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or conditions to be met before performing actions. This helps to handle asynchronous operations and reduce flakiness.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures, such as element not found errors. This could involve retrying actions, refreshing the page, or using alternative locators.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests to handle transient issues, such as network glitches or temporary server unavailability.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login`\n2.  **PIM -> Add Employee Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/pim/addEmployee`\n3.  **Admin -> User Management -> Users Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/viewSystemUsers`\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Login:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Dashboard\" text is visible on the page.\n*   **Successful Navigation to Add Employee Page:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Add Employee\" text is visible on the page.\n*   **Successful Employee Creation:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Successfully Saved\" message is displayed. Verify the new employee is listed in the Employee List.\n*   **Successful Navigation to User Management Page:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Users\" text is visible on the page.\n*   **Successful User Creation:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Successfully Saved\" message is displayed. Verify the new user is listed in the User List.\n*   **Error Handling:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input and that the application does not crash or become unresponsive.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the OrangeHRM application and the organization."
