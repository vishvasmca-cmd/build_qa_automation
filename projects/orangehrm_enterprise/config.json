  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Onboarding Flow\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** OrangeHRM (opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)\n**Business Domain:** Enterprise HR\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a critical onboarding flow within the OrangeHRM application. This strategy will guide all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimizing risks associated with new releases and changes.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe OrangeHRM application falls within the Enterprise HR domain. The onboarding flow, specifically adding a new employee and creating a system user, is a **P1** (High Priority) business process. Failure in this area can lead to:\n\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect or incomplete employee records.\n*   **Access Control Problems:** Inability to grant appropriate system access to new employees.\n*   **Operational Delays:** Hindered HR processes and employee productivity.\n*   **Compliance Risks:** Potential violations of data privacy regulations.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nThe risk profile for this onboarding flow is **Medium-High**. A failure can disrupt HR operations, impact employee experience, and potentially lead to compliance issues.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Successful employee creation with valid data.\n*   Creation of a system user for the newly created employee.\n*   Navigation between modules (Login, PIM, Admin).\n*   Data validation at each step (e.g., First Name, Last Name, User Role).\n*   Error handling for invalid data inputs.\n*   Security checks (basic input sanitization).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress).\n*   Detailed security penetration testing.\n*   Integration with external systems (e.g., payroll, benefits).\n*   Localization testing (different languages).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Detailed reporting functionality.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the following minimal tests:\n\n1.  **Login:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n2.  **PIM Module Load:** Verify the PIM module loads successfully after login.\n3.  **Admin Module Load:** Verify the Admin module loads successfully after login.\n\n**Goal:** Ensure the application is generally functional and accessible.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will cover the complete onboarding flow, including:\n\n1.  **Login:**\n    *   Valid login credentials.\n    *   Invalid login credentials (incorrect username, password).\n    *   Account lockout after multiple failed attempts.\n2.  **PIM Module - Add Employee:**\n    *   Successful employee creation with valid data (First Name, Last Name, etc.).\n    *   Employee creation with missing required fields.\n    *   Employee creation with invalid data (e.g., special characters in name fields, numeric values where text is expected).\n    *   Boundary testing for field lengths (minimum and maximum characters).\n    *   Uploading a valid profile picture.\n    *   Uploading an invalid profile picture (e.g., wrong file type, large file size).\n    *   Saving employee details with and without optional fields.\n3.  **Admin Module - User Management - Users:**\n    *   Successful creation of a system user for the newly created employee.\n    *   User creation with missing required fields.\n    *   User creation with invalid data (e.g., invalid username format).\n    *   Assigning different user roles (Admin, ESS).\n    *   Verifying user access based on assigned role.\n    *   Searching for the newly created user.\n    *   Editing the newly created user's details.\n    *   Deleting the newly created user.\n4.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Verify navigation between modules (Login -> PIM -> Admin).\n    *   Verify navigation within modules (e.g., PIM -> Employee List -> Add Employee).\n5.  **Security:**\n    *   Basic input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks (e.g., try injecting `<script>` tags into name fields).\n    *   Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities (e.g., try injecting SQL commands into login fields).\n6.  **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users creating employees simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures: Simulate network interruptions during employee creation.\n    *   Empty states: Verify appropriate messages when no employees or users are found.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined sets of valid and invalid data for common fields (e.g., valid/invalid email formats).\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Generate unique names and usernames using a library (e.g., Faker) to avoid conflicts.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data should be isolated from production data.  Consider using a dedicated test environment with a copy of the production database (anonymized).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication.\n    *   Create separate page objects for each page or section of the application (e.g., LoginPage, PIMPage, AddEmployeePage, AdminUsersPage).\n    *   Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading.  Avoid hardcoded waits.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically locate elements even if their locators change slightly (e.g., using relative locators or AI-powered element identification).\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement retry logic for flaky tests, especially those involving network requests or external services.  Limit the number of retries to avoid masking genuine issues.\n*   **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to capture detailed information about test execution, including errors, warnings, and debug messages.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** Focus on different login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials, account lockout).\n2.  **PIM Module -> Add Employee Page:** Explore all input fields, data validation rules, and save/cancel actions.\n3.  **Admin Module -> User Management -> Users -> Add User Page:** Explore all input fields, role assignment options, and save/cancel actions.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\nSuccess is defined by the following criteria:\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** All requests should return HTTP 200 (OK) for successful operations.\n*   **UI Element Verification:** Key UI elements (e.g., success messages, error messages, field labels) should be visible and contain the expected text.\n*   **Data Validation:** Data entered into the application should be correctly stored and displayed in the database.\n*   **Functional Correctness:** The application should behave as expected according to the defined requirements.  For example, a new employee should be successfully created and visible in the employee list.\n*   **No Critical Errors:** The application should not throw any unhandled exceptions or critical errors during test execution.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the OrangeHRM application and the business."
