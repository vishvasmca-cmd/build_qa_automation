  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Onboarding Flow\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** OrangeHRM (opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)\n**Business Domain:** Enterprise HR\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a critical onboarding flow within the OrangeHRM application. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, ensuring a consistent and comprehensive approach to testing.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe OrangeHRM application falls within the Enterprise HR domain. The onboarding flow, specifically adding a new employee and creating a system user, is a **P1** (High Priority) business process. Failure in this area can lead to:\n\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect or incomplete employee records.\n*   **Access Control Problems:** Inability for new employees to access necessary systems.\n*   **Compliance Risks:** Potential violations of data privacy regulations.\n*   **Operational Disruptions:** Delays in onboarding, impacting productivity.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nThe risk profile for this onboarding flow is **Medium-High**. A failure can result in significant operational disruptions and potential compliance issues. The system handles sensitive employee data, making data integrity and security paramount.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Successful employee creation with valid data.\n*   Successful system user creation for the new employee.\n*   Validation of data persistence across modules (PIM and Admin).\n*   Negative testing of input fields (e.g., invalid characters, exceeding length limits).\n*   Role-based access control verification for the new user.\n*   Error handling and informative error messages.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   Basic security checks (input sanitization).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Detailed security penetration testing.\n*   Integration with external systems (e.g., payroll, benefits).\n*   Localization testing (different languages).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Detailed reporting functionality.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will provide a rapid health check of the core functionality.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Login Success**\n    *   Steps: Navigate to the login page, enter valid credentials, click login.\n    *   Verification: User is redirected to the dashboard.\n*   **Test Case 2: PIM Module Load**\n    *   Steps: Navigate to the PIM module.\n    *   Verification: The PIM module page loads successfully.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the onboarding flow.\n\n*   **Positive Scenarios:**\n    *   Create employee with all required fields populated.\n    *   Create employee with optional fields populated.\n    *   Create system user with different user roles (Admin, ESS).\n    *   Verify employee details are correctly displayed in the employee list.\n    *   Verify system user details are correctly displayed in the user list.\n\n*   **Negative Scenarios:**\n    *   Attempt to create employee with missing required fields.\n    *   Attempt to create employee with invalid data (e.g., special characters in name).\n    *   Attempt to create system user with an existing username.\n    *   Attempt to create system user without assigning a role.\n    *   Attempt to create system user for a non-existent employee.\n    *   Input validation: Test maximum length of fields, special characters, and SQL injection attempts.\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users creating employees simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures during employee creation.\n    *   Empty states: Verify appropriate messages when no employees or users exist.\n    *   Boundary analysis: Test minimum and maximum allowed values for numeric fields (if any).\n\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on input fields (SQLi, XSS).\n    *   Verify password complexity requirements (if applicable).\n    *   Role-based access control: Ensure users can only access authorized modules and functionalities.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  A set of pre-defined valid usernames and passwords for different user roles.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Employee names, usernames, and other unique identifiers will be dynamically generated to avoid conflicts and ensure test repeatability.  Faker libraries (e.g., JavaFaker, Faker.js) are recommended for generating realistic data.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be managed centrally to ensure consistency and avoid duplication.  Consider using a dedicated test data management tool or a simple spreadsheet for smaller projects.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to improve code maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should be represented as a Page Object, encapsulating the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n*   **Language:** Java or Python are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n*   **Test Framework:** JUnit or TestNG (Java), pytest (Python).\n*   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ (Java), Pytest Assertions (Python).\n*   **Reporting:** Allure Framework for generating comprehensive and visually appealing test reports.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntil` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or enabled, rather than relying on fixed timeouts.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous operations.\n    *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry mechanisms for failed test steps due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing capabilities offered by some testing tools to automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n*   **Locator Strategy:**\n    *   Use robust locators (e.g., IDs, CSS Selectors with unique attributes) that are less likely to change.\n    *   Avoid using fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on text content).\n    *   Implement a locator strategy that prioritizes maintainability and resilience.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Prioritized Exploration)\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploration of the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login`\n2.  **PIM -> Add Employee:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/pim/addEmployee`\n3.  **Admin -> User Management -> Users:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/viewSystemUsers`\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Login Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND presence of the \"Dashboard\" text on the page.\n*   **Employee Creation Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND redirection to the employee details page AND confirmation message displayed (e.g., \"Successfully Saved\").\n*   **User Creation Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND the new user is visible in the user list AND confirmation message displayed (e.g., \"Successfully Saved\").\n*   **General Success:** No unhandled exceptions or errors are thrown during the flow.  No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the OrangeHRM onboarding flow. It should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the application and the evolving needs of the business."
