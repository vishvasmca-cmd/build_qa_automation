  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. We need a comprehensive Master Test Strategy for OrangeHRM, focusing on regression testing of a critical user flow: onboarding a new employee and creating a system user. Here's the plan:\n\n# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Employee Onboarding & User Creation\n\n**Application:** OrangeHRM (opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)\n**Business Domain:** Enterprise HR\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n**Focus:** Employee Onboarding and System User Creation\n\nThis document outlines the test strategy for ensuring the stability and reliability of the employee onboarding and system user creation process within OrangeHRM. It serves as a blueprint for all testing activities, guiding the QA team in building a robust and maintainable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The core functionality being tested (employee onboarding and user creation) is *critical* for any HR system. Failure in this area directly impacts the ability to manage personnel, leading to operational disruptions and potential compliance issues.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High Risk:** Data corruption during employee creation (e.g., incorrect personal information, missing mandatory fields).\n    *   **High Risk:** Security vulnerabilities introduced during user creation (e.g., weak password policies, unauthorized access).\n    *   **Medium Risk:** Inconsistent data between modules (e.g., employee information not synchronized between PIM and User Management).\n    *   **Medium Risk:** Workflow disruptions (e.g., inability to save employee data, errors during user creation).\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Employee onboarding process (PIM module).\n        *   System user creation process (Admin module).\n        *   Data validation and integrity checks throughout the process.\n        *   Security aspects related to user creation (password policies, role-based access control).\n        *   Error handling and exception management.\n        *   Cross-module data consistency.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress, etc.).\n        *   UI/UX testing (unless directly impacting functionality).\n        *   Localization testing.\n        *   Other OrangeHRM modules not directly involved in the onboarding/user creation flow.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Verify basic system health and connectivity.\n    *   **Tests:**\n        1.  Successful Login with valid credentials.\n        2.  Navigation to the PIM module.\n        3.  Navigation to the Admin module.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Employee Onboarding (PIM Module):**\n        *   **Positive:**\n            *   Create new employee with all mandatory fields populated.\n            *   Create new employee with all optional fields populated.\n            *   Verify data persistence after saving.\n            *   Verify data displayed correctly in employee list.\n        *   **Negative:**\n            *   Attempt to create employee with missing mandatory fields.\n            *   Attempt to create employee with invalid data types (e.g., text in a number field).\n            *   Attempt to create employee with data exceeding field length limits.\n            *   Attempt to save without filling required fields.\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Concurrency: Multiple users creating employees simultaneously.\n            *   Network failures during data saving.\n            *   Special characters in employee names and addresses.\n    *   **System User Creation (Admin Module):**\n        *   **Positive:**\n            *   Create a new system user for the newly created employee.\n            *   Assign appropriate roles and permissions.\n            *   Verify user login functionality.\n        *   **Negative:**\n            *   Attempt to create a user with an existing username.\n            *   Attempt to create a user with a weak password (if password policy is enabled).\n            *   Attempt to create a user without assigning a role.\n            *   Attempt to create a user for a non-existent employee.\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   User creation with complex password requirements.\n            *   Role-based access control verification (ensure users can only access authorized features).\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n        *   Password policy enforcement (if configured).\n        *   Authentication and authorization checks.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Dynamic Test Data Generation:** Use a combination of static data (e.g., common names) and dynamically generated data (e.g., unique usernames, random numbers) to ensure test data uniqueness and avoid conflicts.  Consider using a library like Faker.\n        *   **Data Isolation:**  Each test should create its own data and clean it up after execution to prevent interference between tests.\n        *   **Data Masking:**  If sensitive data is used, ensure it is masked or anonymized in test environments.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** **Page Object Model (POM)**. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability. Each page in OrangeHRM should have a corresponding Page Object class that encapsulates the page's elements and actions.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met (e.g., element to be visible, clickable).\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically locate elements even if their locators change slightly (e.g., using relative locators or multiple locator strategies).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests, especially those involving network communication or external services.\n    *   **Centralized Configuration:** Store all configuration parameters (e.g., URLs, credentials, timeouts) in a central configuration file.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Priority Order):**\n    1.  **PIM Module -> Add Employee Page:** Focus on all input fields, validation messages, and the \"Save\" button.\n    2.  **Admin Module -> User Management -> Users -> Add User Page:** Focus on employee selection, username/password fields, role assignment, and the \"Save\" button.\n    3.  **Employee List (PIM Module):** Verify newly created employees are displayed correctly.\n    4.  **User List (Admin Module):** Verify newly created users are displayed correctly.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Ensure all requests return a 200 OK status code (unless an error is expected).\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that all expected elements are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text strings are present on the page (e.g., \"Successfully Saved\", \"Welcome [Employee Name]\").\n    *   **Data Integrity:** Verify that data is saved correctly in the database (if possible).\n    *   **Error Messages:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input or unexpected conditions.\n    *   **Navigation:** Verify that navigation between pages works as expected.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Detailed test reports with clear pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Screenshots and videos for failed tests to aid in debugging.\n    *   Defect tracking system (e.g., Jira) to report and manage bugs.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for ensuring the quality and reliability of the employee onboarding and user creation process in OrangeHRM. By following these guidelines, the QA team can build a comprehensive and maintainable test suite that effectively mitigates risks and ensures a positive user experience.\n"
