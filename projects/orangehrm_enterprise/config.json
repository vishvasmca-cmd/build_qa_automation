  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Onboarding Flow\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** OrangeHRM (opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)\n**Business Domain:** Enterprise HR\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nOrangeHRM is a Human Resources Management (HRM) system. The core business criticality lies in managing employee data, user access, and organizational structure. The specified onboarding flow (adding an employee and creating a system user) is a **P1** (High Priority) process. Failure in this flow directly impacts the ability to manage personnel within the system.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure of the onboarding flow can lead to:\n\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect or incomplete employee records.\n*   **Access Control Problems:** Inability to grant appropriate system access to new employees.\n*   **Operational Disruptions:** Delays in onboarding, impacting productivity.\n*   **Compliance Risks:** Potential violations of data privacy regulations if employee data is mishandled.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   End-to-end testing of the specified onboarding flow:\n    *   Login to the system.\n    *   Navigation to the PIM module.\n    *   Adding a new employee with valid data (\"FirstNameTest LastNameTest\").\n    *   Saving the employee record.\n    *   Navigation to the Admin module -> User Management -> Users.\n    *   Creating a system user for the newly created employee.\n*   Negative testing of input fields (e.g., invalid characters, exceeding length limits).\n*   Testing of error handling and validation messages.\n*   Role-based access control (ensuring only authorized users can perform these actions).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   Basic security checks (input sanitization).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, etc.).\n*   Detailed security penetration testing.\n*   Testing of other OrangeHRM modules beyond the specified onboarding flow.\n*   Mobile testing.\n*   Accessibility testing.\n*   Localization testing.\n*   Integration with external systems.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the following minimal health check:\n\n1.  **Login:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n2.  **PIM Module Load:** Verify that the PIM (Personal Information Management) module loads successfully after login.\n\n**Purpose:** To quickly verify that the core system is operational and that basic navigation is working.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will cover the complete onboarding flow and associated scenarios:\n\n1.  **Positive Flow:**\n    *   Login with valid credentials.\n    *   Navigate to PIM -> Add Employee.\n    *   Enter valid data for all required fields (FirstNameTest, LastNameTest).\n    *   Save the employee record.\n    *   Navigate to Admin -> User Management -> Users.\n    *   Add a new user, associating it with the newly created employee.\n    *   Verify the user is created successfully.\n\n2.  **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Login:** Invalid username, invalid password, empty username/password.\n    *   **Add Employee:**\n        *   Invalid characters in name fields (e.g., special characters, numbers).\n        *   Exceeding maximum length limits for name fields.\n        *   Missing required fields.\n        *   Duplicate employee ID (if applicable).\n        *   Invalid date formats.\n    *   **Add User:**\n        *   Invalid username format.\n        *   Password complexity violations.\n        *   Username already exists.\n        *   Attempting to assign a role that the logged-in user doesn't have permission to assign.\n\n3.  **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users attempting to add employees simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures during the onboarding process (simulating timeouts).\n    *   Empty states: Testing the behavior when no employees or users exist.\n    *   Boundary Analysis: Testing minimum and maximum lengths for input fields.\n\n4.  **Security:**\n    *   Basic input sanitization checks to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.\n    *   Parameter tampering checks (attempting to modify request parameters).\n\n5.  **Data Validation:**\n    *   Verify that data entered in the UI is correctly stored in the database.\n    *   Verify that data displayed in the UI is consistent with the database.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  A set of predefined usernames and passwords for different roles (e.g., Admin, HR Manager).\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Employee names, usernames, and passwords will be dynamically generated to avoid conflicts and ensure uniqueness.  Consider using libraries like Faker.js or similar for data generation.\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   Implement a mechanism to clean up test data after test execution (e.g., deleting the newly created employee and user).\n    *   Use a dedicated test environment to avoid impacting production data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to improve code maintainability and reusability. Each page or section of the application should have its own page object, encapsulating the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits and use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met (e.g., element to be visible, clickable, etc.).\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to handle common issues such as element locators changing.  This could involve using multiple locators for the same element and dynamically selecting the one that works.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  If a test fails, retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** Focus on different login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials).\n2.  **PIM -> Add Employee:** Explore all input fields and their validation rules.\n3.  **Admin -> User Management -> Users -> Add User:** Explore all input fields and their validation rules, including role assignment.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Login:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Welcome\" text visible on the dashboard.\n*   **Employee Creation:** HTTP 200 status code AND success message displayed AND the new employee is visible in the employee list.\n*   **User Creation:** HTTP 200 status code AND success message displayed AND the new user is visible in the user list.\n*   **Error Handling:** Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n*   **Data Integrity:** Data entered in the UI is correctly stored in the database.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the OrangeHRM onboarding flow. It will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the testing process."
