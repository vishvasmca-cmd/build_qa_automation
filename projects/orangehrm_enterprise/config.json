Here's the plan:\n\n# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Regression Testing - Employee Onboarding\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** OrangeHRM (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/)\n**Business Domain:** Enterprise HR\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a critical Enterprise HR application. Failures can lead to inaccurate employee data, payroll errors, security breaches, and compliance issues. The \"Add Employee\" and \"User Management\" functionalities are particularly sensitive.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Data corruption, unauthorized access to employee information, inability to manage users, compliance violations (e.g., GDPR).\n    *   **Medium:** System downtime, performance degradation, inaccurate reporting.\n    *   **Low:** Minor UI glitches, non-critical error messages.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Login functionality\n        *   PIM (Personal Information Management) module\n        *   Add Employee functionality (including all required fields and data validation)\n        *   Admin module - User Management - Users\n        *   Create System User functionality (linking to the newly created employee)\n        *   Data persistence across modules (e.g., employee data entered in PIM is correctly reflected in User Management)\n        *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Ensure the new user has appropriate permissions.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (unless specifically requested later)\n        *   Load testing\n        *   Advanced security testing (beyond basic OWASP Top 10 checks)\n        *   Localization testing (unless specifically requested later)\n        *   Integration with external systems (unless specifically related to the core onboarding flow)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n    *   Verify the PIM module loads successfully.\n    *   Verify the Admin module loads successfully.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Login:**\n        *   Invalid username/password combinations.\n        *   Password reset functionality (if applicable).\n        *   Account lockout after multiple failed attempts.\n    *   **PIM - Add Employee:**\n        *   **Negative Testing:**\n            *   Missing required fields (FirstName, LastName).\n            *   Invalid data formats (e.g., non-numeric employee ID).\n            *   Exceeding maximum field lengths.\n            *   Special characters in name fields (check for XSS vulnerabilities).\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Adding employees with very long names.\n            *   Adding employees with international characters in their names.\n            *   Adding employees with existing employee IDs (duplicate check).\n        *   **Boundary Analysis:**\n            *   Minimum/Maximum allowed values for numeric fields (if any).\n        *   **Alternative Flows:**\n            *   Adding an employee with and without a middle name.\n            *   Adding an employee with and without a photograph.\n        *   **Data Validation:**\n            *   Ensure data entered is correctly saved and displayed.\n            *   Verify data integrity across different views (e.g., list view, edit view).\n    *   **Admin - User Management - Users - Create System User:**\n        *   **Negative Testing:**\n            *   Attempting to create a user with an existing username.\n            *   Missing required fields (Username, Password, Employee Name).\n            *   Invalid password formats (e.g., too short, missing special characters).\n            *   Assigning invalid user roles.\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Creating users with very long usernames.\n            *   Creating users with special characters in usernames.\n        *   **Alternative Flows:**\n            *   Creating users with different user roles (Admin, ESS).\n            *   Creating users and immediately editing their information.\n        *   **Security:**\n            *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on all input fields (especially username and password).\n            *   Verify password complexity requirements are enforced.\n            *   Ensure proper authorization checks are in place (users can only access resources they are authorized to).\n    *   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n        *   Verify that the newly created employee in PIM is available in the \"Employee Name\" dropdown when creating a System User.\n        *   Verify that changes made to employee data in PIM are reflected in the User Management module.\n    *   **Validation Messages:**\n        *   Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input.\n        *   Ensure that error messages are clear, concise, and user-friendly.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Use dynamic data generation for employee names, usernames, and passwords to avoid conflicts and ensure uniqueness.  Consider using libraries like Faker.\n    *   **Data Cleanup:** Implement a mechanism to clean up test data after test execution to avoid data pollution.  This could involve deleting the created employee and user.\n    *   **Data Security:**  Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is handled securely and not stored in plain text.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** **Page Object Model (POM)**. This will improve code maintainability and reusability. Each page or component of the application should have its own Page Object class, encapsulating the elements and actions related to that page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to wait for specific conditions to be met.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to handle minor UI changes. For example, use multiple locators for important elements and try different locators if the primary locator fails.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  If a test fails due to a transient issue (e.g., network timeout), retry the test a few times before marking it as a failure.\n    *   **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to capture detailed information about test execution, including errors, warnings, and debug messages.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Use a reporting framework that provides clear and concise test results, including pass/fail status, execution time, and error messages.\n    *   Integrate the reporting framework with a CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate test reports after each build.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Priority Order):**\n    1.  **Login Page:** Focus on all login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials, password reset).\n    2.  **PIM - Add Employee Page:** Explore all input fields, data validation rules, and alternative flows.\n    3.  **Admin - User Management - Users - Create System User Page:** Explore all input fields, user role assignments, and linking to existing employees.\n    4.  **Employee List View (PIM):** Verify that newly added employees are displayed correctly in the list view.\n    5.  **User List View (Admin):** Verify that newly created users are displayed correctly in the list view.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Login:** Successful login redirects to the home page with the user's name displayed.\n    *   **Add Employee:** Successful submission redirects to the employee details page with a success message. The new employee is visible in the employee list.\n    *   **Create System User:** Successful submission redirects to the user details page with a success message. The new user is visible in the user list.\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all requests return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 302 Redirect, 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error).\n    *   **Database Verification (Optional):**  If possible, verify that data is correctly stored in the database.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for our regression testing efforts on OrangeHRM. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as we learn more about the application and its behavior. Good luck!\n"
