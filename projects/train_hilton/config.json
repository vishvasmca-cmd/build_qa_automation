Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agents on which elements and pages to prioritize for mining and analysis during test execution.\n\n### 4.1. Homepage Mining\n\n*   **Hero Section:** Specifically target the main hero section to extract the headline text. Use element selectors that target `<h1>` or `<h2>` tags within the hero section. Prioritize mining for the text content of the headline.\n*   **Navigation Menu:** Locate the main navigation menu (likely within `<nav>` or `<ul>` tags). Extract all `<a>` (anchor) tags within the menu.  The goal is to get the `href` attribute (the URL) and the link text for each menu item.\n*   **\"Book a Stay\" Button:** Identify the \"Book a Stay\" button. This might be within a form or as a standalone button. Use keyword search and CSS selectors to accurately target this button (e.g., `button:contains('Book a Stay')`, `a:contains('Book a Stay')`). Extract the button's text and the URL it links to.\n\n### 4.2. General Instructions\n\n*   **Prioritize Visible Elements:** Focus on elements that are immediately visible on the page without requiring scrolling or user interaction.\n*   **Robust Selectors:** Use robust CSS selectors or XPath expressions that are less likely to break due to minor website changes. Use `id` attributes where available, but fall back to class names and tag structures.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to gracefully handle cases where elements are not found or behave unexpectedly. Report these errors clearly.\n*   **Dynamic Content:** Be aware of dynamic content, such as A/B tests or personalized content. The agent should be configured to handle slight variations in content without failing the test.\n\n## 5. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browsers:** Chrome (latest version), Firefox (latest version)\n*   **Operating Systems:** Windows 10, macOS Monterey\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n## 6. Reporting\n\n*   The autonomous agent should generate a detailed report for each test run, including:\n    *   Test case ID and description\n    *   Status (Pass/Fail)\n    *   Screenshots (for failed tests)\n    *   Error messages (if any)\n    *   Execution time\n\n## 7. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to cover additional critical user flows, such as Hilton Honors account login and hotel search.\n*   Integrate the smoke test suite into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that every code change is validated.\n*   Add visual validation to detect layout issues and other visual regressions.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for building a reliable smoke test suite for Hilton.com. By following these instructions, autonomous agents can effectively verify the core functionality of the website and ensure a high-quality user experience.\n```"
