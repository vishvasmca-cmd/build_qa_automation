  "master_plan": "# Pinterest Smoke Test: Master Test Strategy\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Pinterest is a social media platform focused on visual discovery. Core business functions revolve around user engagement, content sharing, and advertising. Failure in these areas can lead to user churn, reduced ad revenue, and brand damage.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A critical failure (e.g., login issues, inability to access the main feed) directly impacts user experience and revenue. Data breaches are a high-severity risk due to the personal nature of user data. Loss of trust is a major concern for social media platforms.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, \"Try for Free\" buttons, 2 other buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Basic responsiveness (elements are visible on different screen sizes).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu items (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation (colors, fonts, exact positioning).\n        *   Performance testing (load times, scalability).\n        *   Security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility beyond a single, primary browser (e.g., Chrome).\n        *   Mobile app testing.\n        *   API testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the Pinterest website is accessible and the core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to `https://pinterest.com`. Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button (or equivalent) is present and visible.\n        4.  **\"Try for Free\" Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button (or equivalent) is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify another button is present and visible.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify another button is present and visible.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a link is present and visible.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify a link is present and visible.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present and visible.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present and visible.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for a smoke test.* This document focuses solely on the smoke test strategy.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it only verifies the presence of UI elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** While this is a smoke test, establishing a basic POM structure from the start will facilitate future expansion into regression testing. Create a `HomePage` page object containing locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible()`) to handle potential timing issues during page load. This prevents false failures due to elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial website launch test case. If the page fails to load on the first attempt, retry a few times before failing the test.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage (`https://pinterest.com`):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the page. Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify the elements.\n    *   **No Functional Validation:** Do *not* click on any of the elements. The goal is solely to verify their presence."
