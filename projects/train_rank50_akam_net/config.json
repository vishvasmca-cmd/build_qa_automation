  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Akam.net Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nAkam.net appears to be a general web application. Without deeper knowledge of its specific business purpose, we will assume a moderate risk profile. Website availability and basic functionality are crucial for user engagement and potential business conversions.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Impact of Failure:** Website unavailability or broken core functionality (e.g., login) can lead to:\n    *   Loss of potential customers.\n    *   Damage to brand reputation.\n    *   Decreased user engagement.\n*   **Risk Level:** Moderate. While not a high-stakes financial application, consistent website issues can negatively impact business outcomes.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Website launch and accessibility.\n    *   Identification of key UI elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar) buttons (5 total).\n    *   Identification of 2 links.\n    *   Identification of 2 menu bars.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n    *   Detailed functionality of any specific feature.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n    *   Mobile testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThis suite focuses on verifying the basic health of the Akam.net website.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify a \"Login\" button (or similar) is present and visible.\n    3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar button is present and visible.\n    4.  **Button 3 Presence:** Verify a third button is present and visible.\n    5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify a fourth button is present and visible.\n    6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify a fifth button is present and visible.\n    7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a link is present and visible.\n    8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify a link is present and visible.\n    9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present and visible.\n    10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present and visible.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*N/A - This is a smoke test strategy only.* A full regression strategy would be defined separately.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Data Requirements:** Minimal. No user input or specific data is required for this smoke test.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create a `HomePage` Page Object to represent the Akam.net homepage. This will encapsulate locators and methods for interacting with elements on the page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for elements to load. This is especially important for elements that might be rendered dynamically.\n*   **Locator Strategy:** Prioritize robust locators (e.g., IDs, ARIA attributes) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\n*   **Primary Target:** The Akam.net homepage (`https://akam.net`).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Website Availability:**\n    *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n*   **Button/Link/Menu Bar Presence:**\n    *   Element is present in the DOM.\n    *   Element is visible on the page (e.g., not hidden by CSS).\n    *   Element has a reasonable size (e.g., not 0x0 pixels).\n*   **Success:** All test cases in the Smoke Suite pass.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing smoke tests on Akam.net. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, a well-defined scope, and architectural best practices to ensure reliable and efficient testing."
