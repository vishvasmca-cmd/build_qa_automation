  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Akam.net - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Akam.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Akam.net appears to be a general web application, potentially offering various services or information. The business criticality depends on the specific services offered. Failure to access the website or key functionalities can lead to loss of potential customers, damage to brand reputation, and potential revenue loss.\n*   **Risk Profile:** The risk profile is moderate. Website unavailability or failure of core functionalities can negatively impact user experience and business operations.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Existence and visibility of Login, Signup/GetStarted, and three other buttons (as identified during test execution).\n        *   Existence and visibility of two links.\n        *   Existence and visibility of two menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu bars (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially, focus on desktop).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Launch & Basic Elements**\n        *   **Description:** Verify the website loads successfully and key elements are present.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to `https://akam.net`.\n            2.  Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n            3.  Verify the presence of a Login button/link.\n            4.  Verify the presence of a Signup/GetStarted button/link.\n            5.  Verify the presence of three other distinct buttons/links.\n            6.  Verify the presence of two distinct links.\n            7.  Verify the presence of two distinct menu bars.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   No test data is required for this smoke test, as it only verifies the presence of elements.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke testing. Consider using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators for the Login button, Signup/GetStarted button, links, and menu bars. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for element to be visible) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial page load to handle transient network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://akam.net`):** This is the primary target for identifying the required elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 OK status code for the homepage.\n        *   Login button/link is present and visible.\n        *   Signup/GetStarted button/link is present and visible.\n        *   Three other distinct buttons/links are present and visible.\n        *   Two distinct links are present and visible.\n        *   Two distinct menu bars are present and visible.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   Website fails to load (HTTP error).\n        *   Any of the required elements are missing or not visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Akam.net website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality of the application is verified effectively, minimizing the risk of critical issues in production."
