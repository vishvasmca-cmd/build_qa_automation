  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Google.com Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Google.com is a high-traffic, critical entry point to Google's ecosystem. While this specific test focuses on the homepage, failures here can impact user access to all Google services.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failure of the homepage results in:\n    *   **Reputational Damage**: Inability to access Google services erodes user trust.\n    *   **Service Disruption**: Prevents users from accessing core Google services (Search, Gmail, etc.).\n    *   **Financial Impact**: Indirectly impacts revenue generation from ads and other services.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Successful loading of the Google.com homepage.\n        *   Presence and visibility of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar CTAs), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Basic rendering of the page layout (no major visual defects).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Functionality of any buttons, links, or menu items (no clicks).\n        *   Performance testing (load times).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Accessibility testing.\n        *   Error handling (e.g., what happens if the page fails to load).\n        *   Specific content verification (e.g., exact text on buttons).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Test Case 1: Homepage Load and Element Presence**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://google.com`.\n        2.  Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        3.  Verify the presence of a Login button (or equivalent, e.g., \"Sign in\").\n        4.  Verify the presence of a Signup/GetStarted button (or equivalent, e.g., \"Create account\").\n        5.  Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" button (or equivalent, if applicable).\n        6.  Verify the presence of 5 distinct button elements.\n        7.  Verify the presence of 2 distinct link elements.\n        8.  Verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bar elements.\n\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Static Data**: No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on the presence of elements, not their interaction with data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: While this is a simple smoke test, using POM from the start will improve maintainability as the test suite grows.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class with methods to verify the presence of each element (e.g., `isLoginButtonPresent()`, `isSignupButtonPresent()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to handle potential delays in element loading. This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues. Example: `waitUntilElementIsVisible(loginButton, timeout=5)`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for the entire test case in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    *   **Primary Target**: `https://google.com`\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Success**:\n        *   HTTP 200 OK response for the homepage.\n        *   All specified elements (Login, Signup, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present and visible on the page.\n    *   **Failure**:\n        *   Any HTTP error (e.g., 404, 500).\n        *   Any of the specified elements are missing or not visible.\n        *   Exceptions during test execution.\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   Clear and concise failure messages indicating which element was not found.\n    *   Screenshots on failure to aid in debugging."
