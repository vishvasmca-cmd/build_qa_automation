  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Website Health Check (Smoke Test)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://msftconnecttest.com\n**Business Domain:** General Web Application\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the initial smoke testing of the msftconnecttest.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** This is a general web application. While specific business criticality is unknown, a non-functional website leads to immediate loss of potential users and damages brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or core elements to be present results in:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user experience.\n    *   **Lost Opportunities:** Inability for users to access the site's features.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and load time.\n        *   Presence of key UI elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, 5 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Basic rendering of the page layout.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation (e.g., color schemes, font sizes).\n        *   Performance testing beyond initial load time.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Negative testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the website is accessible and core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the website loads successfully within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        2.  **Login Element Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Element Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link is present on the page.\n        4.  **Button Presence (5):** Verify the presence of 5 other distinct buttons on the page.\n        5.  **Link Presence (2):** Verify the presence of 2 distinct links on the page.\n        6.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bars on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this initial smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document after core functionality is implemented.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No user input is required for this smoke test. Therefore, no test data is needed.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** While the scope is limited, using POM from the start will improve maintainability as the test suite expands. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators for the target elements (Login, Signup, buttons, links, menus).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to be present on the page. This handles potential timing issues during page load.  Example: `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, \"loginButton\")))`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire test case in case of temporary network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target. All elements should be present on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP status code 200 is returned.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified elements (Login, Signup, buttons, links, menus) are present on the page's DOM (Document Object Model).  Use appropriate locators (e.g., ID, CSS selector, XPath) to identify the elements.\n    *   **Success:** All test cases pass, indicating the website is accessible and core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Failure:** Any test case fails, indicating a critical issue that requires immediate investigation.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the initial smoke testing of the msftconnecttest.com website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure a stable foundation for future testing efforts."
