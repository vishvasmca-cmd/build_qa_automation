  "master_plan": "# Taboola.com - Master Test Strategy (Smoke Testing)\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Taboola is a content discovery and advertising platform. Failure can lead to lost revenue, damaged publisher relationships, and reputational harm.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Medium. While not directly handling financial transactions, downtime or critical errors impact revenue generation and brand image.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, 2 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of HTTP status codes for initial page load.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Functionality of buttons/links (no click-through testing).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Responsiveness testing (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Negative testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the Taboola website is accessible and core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Website Launch**: Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **UI Element Presence**: Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   Login button\n            *   Signup/Get Started button (or equivalent)\n            *   Try for Free button (or equivalent)\n            *   Two (2) additional buttons (any on the homepage)\n            *   Two (2) links (any on the homepage)\n            *   Two (2) menu bars (navigation menus)\n*   **Regression Suite**: Not applicable for Smoke Testing.\n*   **Data Strategy**: No specific test data is required for smoke tests, as we are only verifying the presence of UI elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**: Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability and scalability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` Page Object containing locators for all target UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (wait-until) to handle potential delays in element loading.  For example, wait up to 5 seconds for an element to be present before failing the test.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for initial page load failures (e.g., retry up to 3 times with a 1-second delay).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    1.  **Website Launch**: HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    2.  **UI Element Presence**:\n        *   Elements are present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n        *   Elements are visible on the page.\n        *   Text content of buttons/links is reasonably close to expected values (e.g., \"Login\", \"Sign Up\").  Exact match is not required, but the text should be indicative of the element's purpose."
