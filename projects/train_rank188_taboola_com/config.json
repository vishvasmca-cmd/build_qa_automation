  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Taboola.com Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Taboola.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Taboola.com operates in the advertising technology space, connecting publishers with advertisers. The website serves as a marketing and information hub for potential clients and partners.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failure of the website to load or critical elements to function can lead to loss of potential leads, damage to brand reputation, and reduced trust from existing partners.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Existence and accessibility of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, 2 other buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed functionality of any linked pages or forms.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Website Launch**: Verify the Taboola.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button**: Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button**: Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button**: Verify the \"Try for Free\" button is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button 4**: Verify another button (e.g., \"Contact Us\", \"About Us\") is present and visible.\n        6.  **Button 5**: Verify another button (e.g., \"Solutions\", \"Resources\") is present and visible.\n        7.  **Link 1**: Verify a link (e.g., \"Privacy Policy\", \"Terms of Service\") is present and visible.\n        8.  **Link 2**: Verify another link (e.g., \"Careers\", \"Blog\") is present and visible.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1**: Verify a main menu bar (e.g., \"Solutions\", \"Advertisers\") is present and visible.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2**: Verify another main menu bar (e.g., \"Publishers\", \"Resources\") is present and visible.\n*   **Regression Suite**: *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.*\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   Smoke tests do not require dynamic test data. The focus is on UI element presence.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   Implement a basic Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` object containing locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n    *   This allows for easy maintenance and updates if UI elements change.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible, especially after the page loads. This helps avoid flakiness due to slow loading times.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for the initial website load test in case of temporary network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Taboola.com Homepage**: Focus on the initial page load and the presence of the specified UI elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Website Launch**: HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the page title contains \"Taboola\".\n    *   **UI Element Presence**: Each button, link, and menu bar is present in the DOM and is visible on the page. Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify the elements.\n    *   **No Clicking**: The tests should *only* verify the presence of the elements, not interact with them."
