  "master_plan": "# Taboola.com: Master Test Strategy (Smoke Testing)\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Taboola is a content discovery and advertising platform. Failure can lead to lost revenue, damaged publisher relationships, and reputational harm.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Medium. While not directly handling financial transactions, prolonged outages impact revenue generation and brand perception. Data breaches are a high-severity risk, but are not in scope for this smoke test.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website availability and basic functionality.\n        *   Key navigation elements (menu bars, buttons, links).\n        *   Successful loading of core pages.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed functionality of the platform (campaign creation, analytics, etc.).\n        *   Negative testing (invalid inputs, error handling).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS verification).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a single, primary browser - e.g., Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Goal**: Verify the Taboola website is accessible and core navigation elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Homepage Load**: Verify the homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element**: Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element**: Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link is present.\n        4.  **\"Try for Free\" Element**: Verify a \"Try for Free\" button/link is present.\n        5.  **Button Verification (Generic)**: Verify the presence of 5 distinct buttons on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Verification (Generic)**: Verify the presence of 2 distinct links on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Verification (Generic)**: Verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite**: Not applicable for smoke testing. This document focuses solely on the initial smoke test strategy.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   Smoke tests do not require specific test data. The focus is on element presence and page load.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for future test automation. For the initial smoke tests, a simpler approach is acceptable, but the architecture should be designed with POM in mind for future expansion.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (wait-until conditions) to allow elements to load fully before asserting their presence. This mitigates flakiness due to network latency or asynchronous loading. Example: `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.LINK_TEXT, \"Login\")))`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests. If a test fails due to a transient issue, retry it a limited number of times before marking it as a failure.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Favor explicit waits over implicit waits to improve test stability and reduce flakiness.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: Primary focus for initial element discovery.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Homepage Load**: HTTP status code 200 and presence of the `<html>` tag.\n    *   **Element Presence**: The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page and visible (not hidden by CSS).\n    *   **No Errors**: No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console during page load.\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots for failed tests to aid in debugging.\n    *   Report execution time for each test case.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a foundation for ensuring the quality and stability of Taboola.com. It will be reviewed and updated as the application evolves and testing needs change."
