  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: Etsy.com - Smoke Test\n\n## 1. Domain Information\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.etsy.com\n*   **Business Domain:** E-commerce - A global online marketplace focusing on handmade, vintage, and craft supplies.\n*   **Target Audience:** Individuals seeking unique, handcrafted, vintage, or personalized items; creators selling their goods.\n*   **Key Functionality:** Product browsing and search, seller shops, user accounts, shopping cart, checkout process, reviews, and community features.\n*   **Testing Focus:** This test plan outlines the smoke tests to ensure core functionalities are operational and the website is accessible.\n\n## 2. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke suite verifies the basic sanity of the Etsy website. It confirms the site is up, core navigation functions correctly, and a basic user flow is executable.\n\n**2.1 Test Environment**\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest stable version) - Primary target for smoke tests.\n*   **Operating System:** Platform independent (macOS, Windows, Linux)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection.\n\n**2.2 Test Cases**\n\n### Test Case 1: Website Availability & Homepage Load\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Description:** Verify that the Etsy website is accessible and the homepage loads successfully.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.etsy.com`.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The Etsy homepage loads without errors (HTTP status 200 OK).\n    *   The page title should contain \"Etsy\".\n    *   The main header/logo should be visible.\n*   **Priority:** Critical\n\n### Test Case 2: Core Navigation - Menu Links\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Description:** Verify that the main navigation menu links are functional and redirect to the expected pages.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.etsy.com`.\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu (typically at the top of the page).\n    3.  Click on the \"Jewelry & Accessories\" category link.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The \"Jewelry & Accessories\" category page loads without errors.\n    *   The URL should reflect the selected category (e.g., `/c/jewelry-and-accessories`).\n*   **Priority:** High\n\n### Test Case 3: Core Flow - Homepage Headline & Explore Button\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Description:** Verify the hero headline text and the functionality of the 'Explore' button on the homepage.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.etsy.com`.\n    2.  Locate the hero headline on the homepage (prominent text at the top of the page).\n    3.  Verify the headline text.\n    4.  Locate the 'Explore' button, and click it.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The hero headline text should contain \"Shop for handmade and vintage items\".\n    *   Clicking the 'Explore' button navigates the user to a discovery page, potentially showcasing trending items or categories.\n    *   The URL should change to reflect the exploration page (e.g. `/featured`).\n*   **Priority:** High\n\n## 3. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the agent on which elements and pages to focus on for more in-depth testing beyond the smoke suite.\n\n*   **Prioritized Elements for Mining:**\n    *   **Search Bar:**  Mine all attributes related to the search bar (placeholder text, autosuggestions, search button functionality).  Create tests to verify search functionality with different keywords (e.g., \"handmade jewelry\", \"vintage dress\", \"personalized gift\").\n    *   **Product Listings:** Extract data from product listings (title, price, seller name, reviews) to create tests that check for data consistency.\n    *   **Category Pages:** Mine category names and links for ALL categories and sub-categories.\n    *   **Footer Links:** Mine all links in the footer (About, Help, Legal, etc.) and verify they are valid and lead to appropriate pages.\n*   **Prioritized Pages for Mining:**\n    *   **Homepage:**  Extract featured collections, promotional banners, and their corresponding links.\n    *   **Product Detail Page:**  Mine product descriptions, available variations (sizes, colors), shipping information, and seller information.\n    *   **Shopping Cart Page:** Analyze the cart functionality, including adding/removing items, quantity updates, and estimated shipping costs.\n    *   **Checkout Page:** Extract form fields and validation rules for address, payment information.  Do not enter real data!\n*   **Mining Strategies:**\n    *   **Dynamic Content:** Etsy likely uses A/B testing and personalization.  Be prepared to handle dynamic content and adjust tests accordingly.  Mine multiple times with different user agents or cookies to observe variations.\n    *   **Accessibility:** Pay attention to ARIA attributes and semantic HTML structure for accessibility testing.\n    *   **Performance:** Measure page load times for critical pages like the homepage, category pages, and product detail pages.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a starting point for automated testing on Etsy.com.  It focuses on the core functionality to ensure the site is operational and provides guidance for more in-depth testing. Remember to update this plan as the application evolves."
