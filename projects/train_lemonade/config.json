  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan in Markdown format, designed to guide autonomous agents in performing smoke tests on Lemonade.com.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Lemonade.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://www.lemonade.com\n**Business Domain:** Insurance\n**Testing Type:** Smoke Testing\n**Objective:** To ensure the core functionality of Lemonade.com is operational and that key user flows are not broken.\n\n## 1. Domain Information and Analysis\n\nLemonade.com operates in the insurance domain, offering various insurance products (homeowners, renters, pet, car). Their key value proposition is often centered around speed, affordability, and a user-friendly digital experience. This test plan will focus on the key landing page and key navigation/conversion points.\n\n*   **Core Business Goals (Inferred):**\n    *   Acquire new customers seeking insurance quotes.\n    *   Provide a seamless and engaging user experience.\n    *   Drive conversions by simplifying the quote process.\n*   **Target Audience (Inferred):** Tech-savvy individuals looking for convenient and affordable insurance options.\n\n## 2. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThis smoke suite covers the fundamental aspects of the Lemonade.com website to ensure its basic health and functionality.\n\n### 2.1 Test Case 1: Website Availability & Basic Rendering\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the Lemonade.com website is accessible and loads correctly.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.lemonade.com`.\n    2.  Verify that the HTTP status code is 200 (OK).\n    3.  Verify that the main HTML structure is loaded without errors. (e.g. look for `<head>` and `<body>` tags).\n*   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully and displays a valid HTML structure.\n\n### 2.2 Test Case 2: Core Navigation\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the primary navigation links are functional.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.lemonade.com`.\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu (likely in the header).\n    3.  Identify the following links (or similar):\n        *   \"Homeowners\"\n        *   \"Renters\"\n        *   \"Pet\"\n        *   \"Car\"\n    4.  Click on each link.\n    5.  Verify that each link navigates to a valid page within the Lemonade.com domain.  (e.g., the \"Homeowners\" link should navigate to a page about homeowners insurance). Verify that HTTP status code is 200 (OK).\n*   **Expected Result:** All core navigation links are functional and lead to relevant pages within the website.\n\n### 2.3 Test Case 3: Core User Flow - Homepage Headline & \"Check Our Prices\" Button\n\n*   **Description:** Verify the core user flow of landing on the homepage, seeing the main headline, and being able to initiate the quote process.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.lemonade.com`.\n    2.  Locate the main hero headline (typically a large, prominent text element at the top of the page).\n    3.  **Verify that the hero headline contains the text \"Instant, affordable insurance\".** (Exact match or close variant acceptable - agent should flag if deviation is significant).\n    4.  Locate the \"Check Our Prices\" button (or similar call to action button).\n    5.  Click the \"Check Our Prices\" button.\n    6.  Verify that clicking the button navigates the user to a page related to getting a quote (e.g., a form asking for location or property details).\n*   **Expected Result:** The homepage displays the correct headline, the \"Check Our Prices\" button is clickable, and initiates the quote process.\n\n## 3. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agent in identifying key elements and pages for future, more in-depth testing. Prioritization is key here.\n\n*   **Priority 1: Insurance Product Pages:**\n    *   **Mining Target:**  All pages linked from the main navigation related to specific insurance products (Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Car).\n    *   **Mining Action:** Extract all links, forms, and interactive elements on these pages.  Pay special attention to elements related to calculating quotes or starting an application.\n    *   **Rationale:** These pages are critical for conversions and understanding the specific offerings of Lemonade.\n*   **Priority 2: Quote Flow:**\n    *   **Mining Target:** The page or series of pages that appear after clicking \"Check Our Prices\" or similar CTA.\n    *   **Mining Action:** Extract all form fields, validation rules, and any dynamic elements that change based on user input.\n    *   **Rationale:** The quote process is a key conversion funnel. Ensuring its smooth operation is paramount.\n*   **Priority 3: Blog/Educational Content:**\n    *   **Mining Target:**  Any section of the site dedicated to blog posts, articles, or educational content related to insurance.\n    *   **Mining Action:** Extract titles, summaries, and links to individual articles.  Analyze the categories and tags used.\n    *   **Rationale:**  Content marketing is often a key driver of organic traffic and brand awareness.\n\n## 4. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest stable version)\n*   **Operating System:** Platform agnostic (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n## 5. Reporting\n\n*   Any test failures should be reported immediately with detailed logs and screenshots.\n*   A summary report should be generated after each test run, indicating the number of tests passed, failed, and skipped.\n\n## 6. Future Considerations\n\n*   This smoke test suite should be expanded to include more comprehensive end-to-end testing of the quote process.\n*   Accessibility testing should be incorporated to ensure the website is usable by people with disabilities.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing should be performed to ensure the website works correctly on different browsers and devices."
