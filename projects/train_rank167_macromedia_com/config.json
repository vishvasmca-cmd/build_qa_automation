  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Macromedia.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Macromedia.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Macromedia.com, while not specified as an e-commerce or high-transaction site, likely serves as a marketing and information hub for Adobe products (assuming it redirects to Adobe). Failure can lead to lost leads, damaged brand reputation, and potential customer frustration.\n*   **Risk Profile:** The primary risks associated with failure are:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on Adobe.\n    *   **Lost Leads/Opportunities:** Inability for potential customers to access information or sign up for trials.\n    *   **Reduced User Engagement:** Broken links or functionality can deter users from exploring Adobe products.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page rendering.\n        *   Identification of key elements (buttons, links, menus) on the homepage.\n        *   Verification of element presence, not functionality (no clicking).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menus (e.g., clicking and navigating).\n        *   Testing on specific browsers or devices (covered in regression).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Specific content validation (beyond presence).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Homepage Elements:**\n            *   Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n            *   Verify the presence of a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link.\n            *   Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" button/link.\n            *   Verify the presence of 2 additional buttons (any).\n            *   Verify the presence of 2 links (any).\n            *   Verify the presence of 2 menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not executed in this phase, but defined for future use)\n    *   This suite will cover the full functionality of the website, including:\n        *   Clicking all buttons and links and verifying navigation.\n        *   Form submission and validation.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For smoke tests, no specific test data is required. The focus is on element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` class representing the Macromedia.com homepage.\n    *   Within the `HomePage` class, define locators for each element (Login button, Signup button, etc.).\n    *   Implement methods to verify the presence of each element.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays. This prevents false failures due to elements not being immediately visible. Example: `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, \"loginButton\")))`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for website launch. This can address transient network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** Macromedia.com homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 OK is returned.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page. Use appropriate locators (ID, CSS, XPath) to identify the elements.\n    *   **Success Definition:** All verification criteria are met. If any criterion fails, the smoke test fails, and the build should be rejected."
