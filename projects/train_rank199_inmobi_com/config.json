  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: InMobi Website Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: InMobi is an advertising technology platform. Website availability and basic functionality are crucial for lead generation, brand reputation, and client access. Failure can lead to lost business opportunities and damage to brand trust.\n*   **Risk Profile**:\n    *   **High**: Website unavailability or critical functionality failure (e.g., login, signup) directly impacts business.\n    *   **Medium**: Broken links or non-functional buttons degrade user experience and potentially lead to lost leads.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website launch and successful loading.\n        *   Presence and basic functionality (visibility) of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar CTAs), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed functionality of each button/link/menu item (e.g., actual login process, signup form submission).\n        *   Performance testing (load times, etc.).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (beyond a single, agreed-upon browser).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Error handling.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the InMobi website is up and running, and key elements are present and accessible.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Website Launch**: Navigate to `https://inmobi.com` and verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Element**: Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element**: Verify the presence of a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar call-to-action button/link.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element**: Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" or similar call-to-action button/link.\n        5.  **Button Count**: Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons on the page.\n        6.  **Link Count**: Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Count**: Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite**: Not applicable for a smoke test.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Static Data**: No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for this smoke test.  Consider using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**:\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class representing the InMobi homepage.\n        *   Within `HomePage`, define locators for the Login button, Signup button, Try for Free button, links, and menu bars.\n        *   Implement methods to verify the presence of these elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Flakiness Mitigation**:\n        *   **Polling Assertions**: Use short polling intervals (e.g., 500ms) with a timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) to check for element presence. This handles cases where elements load asynchronously.\n        *   **Explicit Waits**: Implement explicit waits for elements to be visible before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Optional)**: For more robust tests, consider implementing basic self-healing. If an element is not found using the primary locator, attempt to locate it using an alternative locator (e.g., by ID, then by XPath).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://inmobi.com`)**: This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Website Launch**: HTTP status code 200 (OK) and page title contains \"InMobi\" (or similar branding).\n    *   **Element Presence**: Elements (Login, Signup, Try for Free, buttons, links, menu bars) are visible on the page.  Use `element.isDisplayed()` or equivalent.\n    *   **Button/Link/Menu Bar Counts**: Verify the correct number of elements are present using `driver.findElements(By.tagName(\"button\")).size()` (or equivalent for links and menu bars).\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   Clearly report any failures, including the specific element that was not found or the HTTP status code that was not 200.\n    *   Include screenshots of the page in case of failure."
