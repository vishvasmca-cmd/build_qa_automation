  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan for `https://www.joinroot.com`, focusing on smoke testing as requested. This plan is designed to guide autonomous agents in efficiently verifying the core functionality of the website before any in-depth testing or automation.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Root Insurance - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** `https://www.joinroot.com`\n**Business Domain:** Banking/Insurance (Specifically, Car Insurance)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke Testing\n**User Goal:** Navigate to Root Insurance homepage. Verify the hero headline contains 'Car insurance based on how you drive'. Find and click the 'Get a Quote' button.\n\n## 1. Domain Information & Analysis\n\nRoot Insurance operates in the competitive car insurance market. Their core value proposition appears to be offering personalized insurance rates based on driving behavior, potentially leading to cost savings for safe drivers. The website likely serves as a primary channel for:\n\n*   **Lead Generation:** Attracting potential customers and gathering their information.\n*   **Brand Awareness:** Communicating Root's unique approach to insurance.\n*   **Customer Acquisition:** Enabling users to get quotes and purchase policies online.\n*   **Customer Self-Service:** Providing access to policy information and support resources (less relevant for smoke testing).\n\n**Key Assumptions:**\n\n*   The website is a critical component of Root's sales and marketing strategy.\n*   Downtime or critical errors on the website can directly impact lead generation and revenue.\n*   The \"Get a Quote\" flow is a primary conversion path.\n\n## 2. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke suite will focus on verifying the most critical functionalities of the website to ensure it is operational and that core user flows are not broken.\n\n**2.1. Basic Website Up & Running Check:**\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Case Name:** Website Availability\n*   **Description:** Verify that the Root Insurance website is accessible and returns a successful HTTP status code (200 OK).\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.joinroot.com`.\n    2.  Check the HTTP status code.\n*   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully, and the HTTP status code is 200 OK.\n\n**2.2. Core Navigation:**\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Case Name:** Main Menu Navigation\n*   **Description:** Verify that the main menu links are present and navigate to the correct pages.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1. Navigate to `https://www.joinroot.com`.\n    2. Locate the main menu (usually in the header).\n    3. Verify that the \"Insurance\" and \"How It Works\" menu items are present.\n    4. Click on the \"Insurance\" menu item.\n    5. Verify that the browser navigates to the correct page.\n    6. Click on the \"How It Works\" menu item.\n    7. Verify that the browser navigates to the correct page.\n*   **Expected Result:** All menu links navigate to their intended destinations without errors.\n\n**2.3. Core Flow - \"Get a Quote\" Happy Path:**\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Case Name:** Get a Quote Flow - Hero Headline and Button\n*   **Description:** Verify the existence of the 'Car insurance based on how you drive' hero headline, and that the 'Get a Quote' button navigates the user to the quote process.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.joinroot.com`.\n    2.  Verify that the hero headline contains the text \"Car insurance based on how you drive\".\n    3.  Locate the \"Get a Quote\" button.\n    4.  Click the \"Get a Quote\" button.\n    5.  Verify that the browser navigates to a page where user is prompted to enter their address.\n*   **Expected Result:** The correct hero headline is present, the \"Get a Quote\" button is clickable, and the subsequent page loads successfully, displaying address entry fields.\n\n## 3. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nTo improve the efficiency of autonomous agents during test execution, prioritize mining these elements and pages:\n\n*   **Hero Section (Homepage):**\n    *   Focus on extracting the text content of the main headline. This is crucial for verifying messaging.\n    *   Identify and locate the \"Get a Quote\" button. Extract its text label and associated URL.\n*   **Navigation Menu (Header):**\n    *   Extract all links within the main navigation menu.\n    *   Prioritize extracting the `href` attributes (URLs) and link text.\n*   **\"Get a Quote\" Page:**\n    *   Identify key input fields (e.g., address, name, vehicle information).\n    *   Extract labels associated with these fields to understand data requirements.\n\n**Mining Prioritization Rationale:**\n\nThese elements are core to the user's initial experience and the primary conversion path. Extracting them first allows the agent to quickly verify their presence, content, and functionality.\n\n**Mining Depth:**\n\n*   For the smoke test, a shallow mining depth is sufficient. Focus on the immediately visible elements and their basic attributes (text, URLs, etc.). Deeper mining (e.g., analyzing JavaScript behavior) can be reserved for more comprehensive testing phases.\n\n**4. Reporting**\n\n*   Any failed tests should be reported with specific details: Test Case ID, actual result, expected result, and a screenshot (if applicable).\n*   The report should clearly indicate whether the smoke test passed or failed overall.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a foundation for autonomously executing smoke tests on the Root Insurance website. It prioritizes critical functionalities and guides the agent to efficiently verify the website's health and core user flow. As the testing matures, the plan should be expanded to include more comprehensive test cases and deeper mining strategies."
