  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan in Markdown format for Pfizer.com, designed to guide autonomous agents for smoke testing.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Pfizer.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Revision:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://www.pfizer.com\n**Business Domain:** Healthcare\n**Testing Type:** Smoke Testing\n**User Goal:** Navigate to Pfizer homepage, verify a key headline, and interact with a primary call-to-action.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for smoke testing Pfizer.com. The purpose of this plan is to provide a clear and concise guide for autonomous agents to quickly verify the website's core functionality and stability. The plan focuses on essential elements and critical user flows to ensure the website is operational and ready for more in-depth testing.\n\n## 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\nPfizer.com is the official website of Pfizer, a leading global biopharmaceutical company. The website serves multiple purposes, including:\n\n*   **Corporate Information:** Providing information about Pfizer's history, mission, values, and leadership.\n*   **Product Information:** Showcasing Pfizer's portfolio of medicines and vaccines.\n*   **Investor Relations:** Publishing financial reports, stock information, and investor resources.\n*   **News and Media:** Sharing press releases, news articles, and media resources.\n*   **Careers:** Advertising job opportunities and providing information for prospective employees.\n*   **Patient Resources:** Offering information and support for patients using Pfizer products.\n*   **Research & Development:** Highlighting Pfizer's commitment to scientific innovation and drug discovery.\n\n**Key Areas of Importance for Smoke Testing:**\n\n*   **Homepage:** Serves as the primary entry point for all users.\n*   **Navigation:** Enables users to quickly find the information they need.\n*   **Key Product Pages:** Showcase Pfizer's core offerings (should be sampled, not exhaustively tested in smoke).\n*   **News Section:** Keeps stakeholders informed of company activities.\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nThis smoke test will cover the following:\n\n*   Website Availability and Basic Functionality\n*   Core Navigation (Main Menu)\n*   Homepage Headline Verification\n*   Homepage Call-to-Action Functionality\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   In-depth testing of all products and services.\n*   Testing of all links and external resources.\n*   Form validation and data submission.\n*   Accessibility testing.\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing.\n*   Mobile-specific testing.\n*   Detailed compatibility testing across different browsers/devices.\n\n## 4. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke suite consists of three core test cases:\n\n### 4.1. Test Case 1: Website Availability & Basic Navigation\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the Pfizer.com website is accessible and that the main navigation menu is functional.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.pfizer.com.\n    2.  Verify that the page loads successfully (HTTP status code 200).\n    3.  Verify that the main navigation menu is present and visible.\n    4.  Verify that each top-level link in the main navigation menu is clickable and navigates to a new page. *Note: Just click and check for a new page load, no content validation required.*\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The website loads without errors.\n    *   The main navigation menu is displayed correctly.\n    *   All top-level navigation links are functional.\n\n### 4.2. Test Case 2: Homepage Headline Verification\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the hero headline on the Pfizer.com homepage contains the expected text.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.pfizer.com.\n    2.  Locate the main hero headline element (Hint: Look for an `<h1>` tag or a prominent text element in the hero section).\n    3.  Verify that the headline text contains the string: \"Breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives\". *Note: Case-insensitive match is acceptable.*\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The hero headline is present on the homepage.\n    *   The headline text contains the expected string.\n\n### 4.3. Test Case 3: Homepage Call-to-Action (Happy Path)\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the \"Learn More\" button on the homepage is clickable and navigates to a new page.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.pfizer.com.\n    2.  Locate the \"Learn More\" button (Hint: Look for a button element with the text \"Learn More\" within the hero section).  Prioritize buttons near the headline.\n    3.  Click the \"Learn More\" button.\n    4.  Verify that clicking the button navigates to a new page (i.e., the URL changes). *Note: No content validation on the new page is required.*\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The \"Learn More\" button is present and clickable.\n    *   Clicking the button navigates the user to a new page.\n\n## 5. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agent in identifying key elements on the page.\n\n*   **Prioritize the Homepage:** The homepage is the most critical page for smoke testing. Focus efforts on elements within the initial viewport.\n*   **Headline Identification:** Look for `<h1>` tags or elements with prominent font sizes and styling within the hero section of the homepage.  Use contextual clues like proximity to a hero image to aid identification.\n*   **\"Learn More\" Button Identification:** Search for `<button>` or `<a>` tags containing the text \"Learn More\". Prioritize elements near the identified headline. If multiple \"Learn More\" buttons exist, select the one closest to the main hero headline.\n*   **Navigation Menu Identification:**  Inspect the DOM for common navigation patterns (e.g., `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>` elements). Look for elements with `aria-label=\"Main Navigation\"` or similar attributes.\n*   **Dynamic Content Considerations:** Be aware that the homepage content, including the headline and \"Learn More\" button destination, may change over time. The agent should be adaptable to minor variations in text and layout.\n\n## 6. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest stable version)\n*   **Operating System:** Platform agnostic (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n## 7. Reporting\n\n*   The autonomous agent should generate a clear and concise test report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n*   The report should include any error messages or relevant debugging information encountered during testing.\n*   Failed test cases should be flagged for further investigation.\n\n## 8. Success Criteria\n\nThe smoke test suite is considered successful if all test cases pass. Failure of any test case indicates a critical issue that requires immediate attention.\n\n## 9. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to include other critical user flows, such as searching for products or accessing patient resources.\n*   Integrate the smoke tests into a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for automated testing.\n*   Add visual regression testing to detect unintended changes in the website's appearance.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a foundation for effectively smoke testing Pfizer.com. By following these guidelines, autonomous agents can efficiently verify the website's core functionality and ensure a positive user experience."
