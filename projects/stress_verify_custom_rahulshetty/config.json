  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Rahul Shetty Academy Automation Practice\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Rahul Shetty Academy Automation Practice website (https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding test automation efforts and ensuring comprehensive test coverage.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe target website is a practice site for automation testing. While not a live production environment, thorough testing is crucial to ensure the reliability and robustness of automation scripts developed against it. The specific user goal of typing in a country, selecting a valid option, and handling alerts is a common web application interaction pattern.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure to properly test this application could lead to:\n\n*   **Incorrect Automation Script Development:** Flawed automation scripts based on a poorly tested application can lead to inaccurate results and wasted effort.\n*   **Missed Edge Cases:** Overlooking edge cases and error conditions can result in brittle and unreliable automation.\n*   **Lack of Confidence:** Insufficient testing can erode confidence in the automation framework and the overall testing process.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Functionality related to typing in a country, selecting a valid option from the dropdown, and handling alerts.\n*   Positive and negative scenarios for country input (valid, invalid, special characters, empty).\n*   Different browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   Different screen resolutions.\n*   Accessibility testing (basic checks).\n*   Performance testing (page load times for key interactions).\n*   Security testing (basic input validation to prevent XSS).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Testing of other functionalities on the website unrelated to the specified user goal.\n*   In-depth performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n*   Database testing (if applicable, assume data is mocked or pre-populated).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will focus on verifying the basic functionality of the target area.\n\n*   **Test Case 1:** Navigate to the page, enter a valid country (e.g., \"India\"), select the suggestion, and verify that the alert is displayed.\n*   **Verification Criteria:** Page loads successfully, country suggestion appears, correct country is selected, alert is displayed, and alert text is verified.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the target functionality.\n\n*   **Positive Testing:**\n    *   Enter valid countries and select the correct suggestion.\n    *   Verify the alert message is correct for different countries.\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Enter invalid countries (e.g., \"XYZ\"). Verify no suggestions appear.\n    *   Enter special characters in the country field. Verify appropriate error handling.\n    *   Enter an empty string. Verify appropriate error handling.\n    *   Enter a valid country but do not select a suggestion. Verify appropriate error handling (if any).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Enter very long strings in the country field.\n    *   Rapidly type and delete characters in the country field.\n    *   Simultaneous user access (if applicable, simulate multiple users interacting with the page).\n    *   Network failures (simulate slow or intermittent network connections).\n*   **Security Testing:**\n    *   Attempt basic XSS attacks by entering malicious scripts in the country field (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`). Verify that the script is not executed.\n*   **Accessibility Testing:**\n    *   Verify that the country field and suggestions are accessible via keyboard navigation.\n    *   Verify that the alert message is properly announced by screen readers.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** A list of valid and invalid countries will be maintained in a data file (e.g., CSV, JSON).\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** For edge cases like long strings, data will be dynamically generated within the test scripts.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a version-controlled repository alongside the test scripts.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create separate page objects for the main page and the alert dialog. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Language:** Java or Python are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n*   **Testing Framework:** JUnit or TestNG (Java) or pytest (Python) are recommended.\n*   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ (Java) or Pytest's built-in assertions (Python) are recommended for fluent assertions.\n*   **Reporting:** Allure or Extent Reports are recommended for generating detailed and visually appealing test reports.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous updates and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to wait for specific conditions to be met.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to handle common issues like element locators changing. This could involve using multiple locators for the same element and retrying with a different locator if the first one fails.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. This will help to reduce the impact of intermittent failures.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following areas:\n\n*   **Country Input Field:** Focus on the input field where the country name is entered.\n*   **Suggestion List:** Explore the list of suggestions that appear as the user types.\n*   **Alert Dialog:** Focus on the alert dialog that appears after a country is selected.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\nSuccess is defined as:\n\n*   **HTTP 200 Status Code:** The page loads successfully with an HTTP 200 status code.\n*   **Element Visibility:** The country input field, suggestion list, and alert dialog are visible and interactable.\n*   **Correct Suggestions:** The correct country suggestions appear based on the input.\n*   **Accurate Alert Message:** The alert message is accurate and relevant to the selected country.\n*   **No JavaScript Errors:** No JavaScript errors are present on the page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the Rahul Shetty Academy Automation Practice website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure thorough test coverage and build robust and reliable automation scripts."
