  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Dzen.ru Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the smoke testing of Dzen.ru. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Dzen.ru is a content aggregation and recommendation platform. Its business criticality lies in delivering relevant and engaging content to users, maintaining user engagement, and serving advertisements effectively.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of User Engagement:** If users cannot access content or navigate the platform, they will likely abandon it.\n    *   **Revenue Loss:** If advertisements are not displayed correctly or the platform is inaccessible, revenue will be directly impacted.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Frequent outages or critical bugs can damage the platform's reputation and user trust.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, 5 Buttons, 2 Links, 2 Menu Bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the identified UI elements (e.g., clicking buttons, submitting forms).\n        *   Content accuracy or relevance.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the basic health and accessibility of Dzen.ru.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify that the Dzen.ru website loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element Check:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Check:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link.\n        4.  **Button Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 5 distinct buttons on the homepage.\n        5.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 distinct links on the homepage.\n        6.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 distinct menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for Smoke Test, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   N/A - Smoke test focuses on core functionality only.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** For this smoke test, no specific test data is required. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Dzen.ru homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class with methods to identify and verify the presence of the required UI elements (Login, Signup, buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with reasonable timeouts to handle potential loading delays of UI elements. This will reduce flakiness due to timing issues.\n    *   **Example:** Instead of a direct assertion like `Assert.assertTrue(homePage.isLoginButtonPresent())`, use a polling assertion that retries for a few seconds:\n\n    ```java\n    // Example using Selenium and JUnit\n    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(5));\n    wait.until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.xpath(\"//button[@id='loginButton']\")));\n    Assert.assertTrue(homePage.isLoginButtonPresent());\n    ```\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://dzen.ru):** This is the primary target for identifying all required UI elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code AND the presence of the main page content (e.g., a specific header or logo).\n    *   **UI Element Identification:** The test should successfully locate and verify the presence of the specified UI elements (Login, Signup, 5 Buttons, 2 Links, 2 Menu Bars) on the homepage. The test should PASS if all elements are found.\n    *   **Failure Criteria:** The test should FAIL if the website does not load (HTTP error), or if any of the required UI elements are not found on the homepage.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for the smoke testing of Dzen.ru. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the quality and stability of the platform."
