  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document for https://practice.automationtesting.in/, focusing on Regression testing for the \"My Account\" registration flow. This document is designed to provide clear guidance to the entire engineering team.\n\n# MASTER TEST STRATEGY: My Account Registration Flow - Regression\n\n**Application:** https://practice.automationtesting.in/\n**Business Domain:** Generic (E-commerce Practice Site)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n**Focus Area:** My Account Registration Flow\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** This is a practice e-commerce site. While not a production system, a failing registration process still impacts user experience and can lead to lost opportunities for learning and demonstration.\n\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   *Low Financial Risk:* No real-world transactions are involved.\n    *   *Low Data Breach Risk:* No sensitive user data should be stored.\n    *   *Medium Trust Risk:* A broken registration flow will frustrate users trying to learn automation, impacting the site's credibility.\n    *   *High Operational Risk (for Demonstration Purposes):* If core functionality is broken on a demonstration site, it defeats its purpose.\n\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All aspects of the \"My Account\" -> \"Register\" flow, including:\n            *   Input fields (username, email, password).\n            *   Error handling and validation.\n            *   Success/failure messages.\n            *   Password strength requirements (if any).\n            *   Interaction with any backend systems (database, email).\n            *   Navigation to the \"My Account\" dashboard after successful registration.\n            *   Cookie creation and management related to login state.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n        *   Basic responsiveness (desktop and mobile).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Payment processing.\n        *   Shipping and order fulfillment.\n        *   Detailed performance testing.\n        *   Comprehensive security penetration testing.\n        *   Testing of other areas of the website outside of the \"My Account\" registration flow.\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance). While important, it's excluded for initial regression testing.\n        *   API testing is out of scope unless directly impacting the UI flow being tested.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   Navigate to the homepage.\n    *   Click \"My Account\".\n    *   Navigate to the Registration form.\n    *   Attempt to register with valid credentials.\n    *   Verify successful registration redirects to \"My Account\" dashboard.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n\n    *   **Positive Testing:**\n        *   Register with valid credentials (different username/email combinations).\n        *   Register with valid credentials using different browsers.\n        *   Register with valid credentials on different screen sizes.\n        *   Check registered user is displayed on the \"My Account\" dashboard.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   **Invalid Inputs:**\n            *   Empty username.\n            *   Invalid email format (missing @, missing domain).\n            *   Short password.\n            *   Long password.\n            *   Special characters in username.\n            *   SQL injection attempts in username/email/password fields.\n            *   XSS attempts in username/email/password fields.\n        *   **Boundary Values:**\n            *   Minimum and maximum password lengths.\n        *   **Existing User:**\n            *   Attempt to register with an already existing username.\n            *   Attempt to register with an already existing email address.\n        *   **Error Messages:**\n            *   Verify that appropriate and user-friendly error messages are displayed for all invalid inputs.\n            *   Verify error messages are displayed in the correct location (near the input field).\n        *   **Navigation:**\n            *   Verify that clicking \"Login\" redirects to the login page.\n            *   Verify \"Lost your password?\" link redirects to the password reset page.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   **Concurrency:** Simulate multiple users registering simultaneously (if feasible).\n        *   **Network Errors:** Simulate network timeouts during registration (if possible).\n        *   **Database Errors:** Simulate database connection errors during registration (if possible, though less likely on a demo site).\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Dynamic Generation:** Use a library (e.g., Faker) to generate unique usernames, email addresses, and passwords for each test run. This prevents test conflicts and ensures data uniqueness.\n    *   **Data Storage:** Do NOT store any sensitive data in the test scripts. Only store randomly generated data for the duration of a single test execution.\n    *   **Data Cleanup:** Consider implementing a mechanism to delete test accounts after the regression suite runs to avoid accumulating unnecessary data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM to represent the \"My Account\" page and the registration form as separate page objects. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Test Framework:** Use a robust testing framework like Selenium WebDriver with a language such as Java, Python, or C#.\n    *   **Assertion Library:** Use an assertion library like JUnit or AssertJ for clear and readable assertions.\n    *   **Reporting:** Integrate with a reporting tool (e.g., Allure Report) to generate detailed test reports.\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use explicit waits and polling assertions to handle asynchronous behavior and prevent false failures due to timing issues.  Example: `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(expected_conditions.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, \"successMessage\")))`\n    *   **Self-Healing (Limited):** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms, such as retrying element lookups or re-navigating to the page if an element is not found.  Be cautious with overly aggressive self-healing, as it can mask underlying issues.\n    *   **Test Isolation:** Ensure each test is independent and does not rely on the state of previous tests. This reduces the risk of cascading failures.\n    *   **Environmental Awareness:**  Configure tests to handle different environments (e.g., local development, staging) gracefully.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Order of Priority):**\n\n    1.  **Registration Form:** Focus on exploring all input fields (username, email, password) with various valid and invalid inputs.\n    2.  **Error Message Display:** Prioritize exploring scenarios that trigger different error messages to ensure they are displayed correctly.\n    3.  **Success/Failure Navigation:** Explore scenarios that lead to successful registration and scenarios that result in registration failures. Verify correct redirection and display of relevant messages.\n    4.  **My Account Dashboard:** Verify that the registered user can see his/her details in the \"My Account\" dashboard after successful registration.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Verify that key elements (e.g., input fields, buttons, error messages, success messages) are present on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text strings are displayed correctly (e.g., \"Registration successful\", \"Invalid email address\").\n    *   **Redirection:** Verify that clicking on links or submitting forms redirects to the correct page.\n    *   **Database Verification (Optional):** If possible, verify that the user account is created correctly in the database (username, email, password hash).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust regression test suite for the \"My Account\" registration flow.  Remember to adapt this strategy as needed based on the evolving needs of the project. Good luck!"
