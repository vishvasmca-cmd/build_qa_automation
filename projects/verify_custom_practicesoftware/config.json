I will generate a Master Test Strategy document for the e-commerce application at `https://practice.automationtesting.in/`, focusing on regression testing and the user goal of registering via the \"My Account\" page. This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: E-commerce Application - Regression Testing\n\n**Application:** `https://practice.automationtesting.in/`\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n**User Goal:** Click My Account and Register\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThis is an e-commerce application. The core business functions revolve around product browsing, adding to cart, checkout, and account management.  The \"My Account\" and registration flow are critical for user acquisition and retention.\n\n*   **P0 (Critical):** Registration, Login, Checkout, Payment Processing\n*   **P1 (High):** Product Browsing, Add to Cart, User Profile Management\n*   **P2 (Medium):** Search Functionality, Product Reviews, Contact Us Form\n*   **P3 (Low):**  Blog, Static Content Pages\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure in the registration process can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Potential Customers:** Users unable to create accounts may abandon the site.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** A buggy or unreliable registration process can erode user trust.\n*   **Data Security Risks:** Vulnerabilities in the registration process can be exploited for malicious purposes (e.g., account creation abuse, data injection).\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to the \"My Account\" page, including:\n    *   Registration process (new user creation)\n    *   Login process (existing user authentication)\n    *   Password reset functionality\n    *   Account profile management (if applicable)\n*   Integration of the \"My Account\" functionality with other core modules (e.g., product browsing, checkout).\n*   Negative testing of all input fields (e.g., invalid email formats, password complexity).\n*   Edge case scenarios (e.g., concurrent registration attempts, account lockout).\n*   Security testing for common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) in the registration and login forms.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed performance testing (load, stress).  This will be addressed in a separate performance testing strategy.\n*   Thorough testing of third-party integrations (e.g., payment gateways) beyond basic connectivity checks.\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) in this phase.\n*   Detailed browser compatibility testing beyond the primary supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will verify the basic functionality of the \"My Account\" page.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify that the \"My Account\" link is visible and clickable on the homepage.\n    *   Verify that the \"My Account\" page loads successfully.\n    *   Verify that the registration form is present on the \"My Account\" page.\n    *   Verify that a user can successfully register with valid credentials.\n    *   Verify that a registered user can successfully log in.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will cover a wide range of scenarios to ensure the stability and reliability of the \"My Account\" functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid email formats (e.g., missing \"@\", invalid domain).\n    *   Weak passwords (e.g., too short, common words).\n    *   Missing required fields.\n    *   Attempting to register with an already existing email address.\n    *   Invalid login credentials (e.g., incorrect password).\n    *   Password reset attempts with invalid email addresses.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrent registration attempts from multiple users.\n    *   Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.\n    *   Handling of special characters in input fields.\n    *   Registration with extremely long or short usernames/passwords.\n    *   Network failures during registration or login.\n*   **Security Testing:**\n    *   Basic XSS prevention checks on all input fields (e.g., attempting to inject JavaScript code).\n    *   CSRF protection verification on the registration and login forms.\n    *   Password storage security (verify passwords are not stored in plain text).\n*   **Alternative Flows:**\n    *   Registration and login using different browsers.\n    *   Password reset flow verification.\n    *   Account profile update scenarios (if applicable).\n*   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n    *   Verify that successful registration updates the user database correctly.\n    *   Verify that login status is correctly reflected across the application (e.g., personalized content, access to member-only areas).\n*   **Validation Messages:**\n    *   Verify that appropriate and user-friendly error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n    *   Verify that success messages are displayed after successful registration or login.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined sets of valid and invalid email addresses, passwords, and usernames will be created.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Randomly generated data will be used to create unique usernames and email addresses for registration.  Faker libraries should be used for realistic data generation.\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   Test data should be stored in a separate configuration file or database.\n    *   Test data should be regularly refreshed to avoid conflicts and ensure data integrity.\n    *   Sensitive data (e.g., passwords) should be handled securely and encrypted.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  A Page Object Model should be implemented to create reusable and maintainable test code. Each page of the application (e.g., \"My Account\" page, Registration Form, Login Form) should be represented as a separate Page Object.\n*   **Programming Language:**  [Choose a language - e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript] based on team expertise and project requirements.\n*   **Testing Framework:** [Choose a framework - e.g., pytest, JUnit, Mocha] that provides features such as test discovery, reporting, and parallel execution.\n*   **Assertion Library:** [Choose an assertion library - e.g., AssertJ, Chai] for writing clear and concise assertions.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_until` or `explicit waits`) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures (e.g., retrying failed assertions, re-locating elements).\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  Consider using a decorator or plugin to automatically retry failed tests a limited number of times.\n*   **Centralized Configuration:** Store locators and other configuration data in a centralized location to facilitate easy updates and maintenance.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Locate and click the \"My Account\" link.\n2.  **My Account Page:** Identify the registration and login forms.\n3.  **Registration Form:** Explore all input fields, validation messages, and submit button.\n4.  **Login Form:** Explore all input fields, validation messages, and submit button.\n5.  **Password Reset Flow:** Initiate and complete the password reset process.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant page elements are visible and interactable (e.g., registration form, login form).\n    *   Successful registration redirects the user to the account dashboard or a confirmation page.\n    *   Successful login redirects the user to the account dashboard or a personalized page.\n    *   Appropriate success and error messages are displayed for all actions.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected exceptions or errors during registration or login.\n    *   Incorrect redirects or page content.\n    *   Missing or incorrect validation messages.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing the \"My Account\" functionality of the e-commerce application.  It will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the testing process.\n```\n"
