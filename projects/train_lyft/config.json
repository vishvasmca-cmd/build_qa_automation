  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan for Lyft's website (https://www.lyft.com), designed to guide autonomous agents for smoke testing *before* automation scripting begins.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Lyft.com (Smoke Testing)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis Master Test Plan outlines the strategy for smoke testing the Lyft website (https://www.lyft.com).  The primary goal is to ensure the core functionality and critical user flows are operational after deployments or updates. This plan focuses on quickly identifying major issues that would prevent users from completing essential tasks.\n\n## 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\n*   **Target URL:** https://www.lyft.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Transportation / Ridesharing\n*   **Description:** Lyft is a transportation network company offering ride-hailing services, connecting passengers with drivers via a mobile app and website.\n*   **Key Features & Functionality:**\n    *   Ride Requesting: Core functionality allowing users to book rides.\n    *   Driver Sign-Up:  Recruiting and onboarding new drivers.\n    *   Pricing & Payment:  Displaying fares and managing payment methods.\n    *   Account Management:  User profile and settings.\n    *   Location Services:  Utilizing GPS for ride tracking and pickup/dropoff.\n\n## 3. Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Website availability and basic rendering.\n    *   Core navigation (homepage, primary menu links).\n    *   Ride request flow (limited to UI elements, not actual ride booking).\n    *   User sign-up initiation.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Mobile app testing.\n    *   Payment processing.\n    *   Detailed fare calculations.\n    *   Driver-specific functionality.\n    *   Accessibility testing (to be covered in separate test plan).\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n    *   API testing.\n    *   All edge cases.\n\n## 4. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThis suite will consist of three main test cases:\n\n### 4.1 Website Availability & Basic Rendering\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Case Name:** Website Availability Check\n*   **Description:** Verify the Lyft website is accessible and loads without errors.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.lyft.com\n    2.  Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP status code 200).\n    3.  Verify that key visual elements are present (e.g., Lyft logo, main navigation).\n*   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully with no server errors, and key visual elements are displayed.\n\n### 4.2 Core Navigation\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Case Name:** Main Menu Navigation Check\n*   **Description:** Verify the primary navigation links are functional and redirect to the correct pages.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.lyft.com\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu (likely in the header).\n    3.  Click on each primary link in the menu (e.g., \"Lyft Driver\", \"Lyft Business\", \"Cities\").\n    4.  Verify that each link redirects to a relevant page.\n    5.  Verify that the title changes and no server errors occur.\n*   **Expected Result:** All main navigation links redirect to their respective pages without errors.\n\n### 4.3 Core Flow - Request a Ride & Sign Up\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Case Name:** Request a Ride & Sign Up Flow\n*   **Description:** Simulate a basic ride request initiation and user sign-up. This focuses on UI element verification and page navigation.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.lyft.com\n    2.  Verify the hero headline contains the text \"Request a ride now.\"\n    3.  Locate and click the \"Sign Up\" button (or similar text/icon).\n    4.  Verify that clicking the \"Sign Up\" button redirects the user to the registration page.\n*   **Expected Result:** The headline is correct, the \"Sign Up\" button is found and functional, and the user is redirected to the sign-up page.\n\n## 5. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents\n\nThese instructions are crucial for guiding the autonomous agents in identifying key elements and prioritizing their analysis.\n\n*   **Prioritized Elements for Mining:**\n    *   **Homepage Hero Section:** Focus on extracting the headline text, ride request input fields (if present), and any call-to-action buttons (e.g., \"Request a Ride,\" \"Get Started\").\n    *   **Main Navigation Menu:**  Identify all the links within the main navigation (using tags like `<nav>` or elements with class names like \"main-nav\", \"navigation\").\n    *   **\"Sign Up\" Button:**  Search for buttons or links with text containing \"Sign Up,\" \"Join,\" \"Register,\" or similar terms.  Also, look for icons that visually represent sign-up.  Prioritize elements with `href` attributes pointing to registration-related URLs.\n    *   **Footer Links:** Mine links within the footer (often contained within `<footer>` tags). While lower priority than the main navigation, these links can reveal key information.\n\n*   **Pages to Prioritize for Mining:**\n    *   **Homepage (/)**: Highest priority. Focus on the hero section, navigation, and sign-up/login areas.\n    *   **Any Page Linked from Main Navigation**:  Second highest priority. Analyze the content and functionality of these pages.\n    *   **Sign-Up/Registration Page (/signup, /register, etc.)**:  If the agent can identify the signup/registration page URL, prioritize mining form elements and validation messages.\n\n*   **Specific Attributes to Extract:**\n    *   `href` (for all links)\n    *   `text` (for all links, buttons, and headings)\n    *   `class` (for all elements to identify styling and potential JavaScript hooks)\n    *   `id` (for unique element identification)\n    *   `placeholder` (for input fields)\n    *   `type` (for input fields - text, email, password, etc.)\n\n*   **Mining Heuristics:**\n    *   **Proximity:** Elements located near each other are likely related (e.g., a label next to an input field).\n    *   **Semantic HTML:** Prioritize elements that use semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).\n    *   **ARIA Attributes:** Pay attention to ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`) as they often provide important context.\n\n## 6. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version) - primary focus.  Consider Firefox and Safari for cross-browser compatibility in future test cycles.\n*   **Operating System:**  Platform-independent (web-based).\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection.\n\n## 7. Entry and Exit Criteria\n\n*   **Entry Criteria:**\n    *   The Lyft website (https://www.lyft.com) is deployed and accessible.\n    *   This Master Test Plan is reviewed and approved.\n*   **Exit Criteria:**\n    *   All test cases in the Smoke Suite have been executed.\n    *   All critical defects identified during smoke testing are resolved.\n    *   A smoke test report has been generated.\n\n## 8. Defect Reporting\n\n*   All defects will be reported in a clear and concise manner, including:\n    *   Test Case ID\n    *   Steps to Reproduce\n    *   Expected Result\n    *   Actual Result\n    *   Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)\n    *   Priority (High, Medium, Low)\n\n## 9. Metrics\n\n*   **Pass Rate:** Percentage of smoke test cases that pass.\n*   **Failure Rate:** Percentage of smoke test cases that fail.\n*   **Defect Density:** Number of defects found per test case.\n*   **Execution Time:** Total time taken to execute the smoke suite.\n\n## 10. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the smoke suite to cover more critical user flows (e.g., ride request with destination, payment method update).\n*   Implement automated smoke tests using a suitable testing framework (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Playwright).\n*   Integrate smoke tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous quality assurance.\n*   Develop a regression test suite to prevent regressions after code changes.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the Lyft website. By following these guidelines, autonomous agents can effectively identify critical issues and ensure the website's core functionality is working as expected."
