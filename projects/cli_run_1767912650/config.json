  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for ParaBank, a demonstration banking application. It serves as the blueprint for all testing activities and provides guidance to the engineering team.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1. Analyze the Domain\n\nParaBank, while a demonstration application, simulates core banking functionalities.  The most critical business functions (P0) include:\n\n*   **Registration:** Account creation is the foundation of customer access.\n*   **Login:** Secure access to user accounts.\n*   **Open Account:** Enabling users to create new accounts.\n*   **Transfer Funds:** A fundamental banking transaction.\n*   **Request Loan:** Core revenue-generating function.\n\n### 1.2. Determine Risk Profile\n\nFailure in these critical areas can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inaccurate transfer of funds, incorrect loan amounts.\n*   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data.\n*   **Trust Loss:** Damage to the bank's reputation if the system is unreliable.\n*   **Legal/Compliance issues:** Incorrect calculations or data handling impacting reporting.\n\n### 1.3. Define Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities described in the \"User Goal\": Registration, Login, Open Account, Transfer Funds, Request Loan.\n*   Positive and negative scenarios for each of the above functions.\n*   Boundary testing of input fields (e.g., amount fields, account numbers).\n*   Security testing focusing on common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance). This requires a separate performance test plan.\n*   Detailed accessibility testing (WCAG compliance). This would require dedicated accessibility testing tools and expertise.\n*   Mobile application testing (if any).\n*   Integration with external systems (if any exist beyond the demo).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1. Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite provides a rapid health check.  If these tests fail, the build *must* be rejected.\n\n*   **Registration:** Verify successful registration of a new user.\n*   **Login:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n*   **Account Summary:** Verify the account summary page loads after login.\n*   **Transfer Funds:** Verify a successful transfer of funds between two existing accounts.\n*   **Request Loan:** Verify a loan request can be submitted.\n\n### 2.2. Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite ensures existing functionality remains intact after changes.\n\n*   **Positive Testing:**\n    *   All \"Happy Path\" scenarios for Registration, Login, Open Account, Transfer Funds, and Request Loan.\n    *   Multiple accounts created with different parameters.\n    *   Transferring funds between various account types.\n    *   Requesting loans with varying amounts, down payments, and account details.\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Registration:** Invalid input formats for fields like username, password, address, phone number, etc.  Duplicate usernames. Password complexity enforcement.\n    *   **Login:** Invalid username/password combinations.  Account lock-out after multiple failed attempts.\n    *   **Open Account:** Attempting to open accounts with invalid input (e.g., negative initial deposit). Selecting invalid account types.\n    *   **Transfer Funds:** Insufficient funds, invalid account numbers (source/destination), attempting to transfer zero or negative amounts.\n    *   **Request Loan:** Invalid loan amounts (negative, zero, exceeding limits). Invalid down payments.  Invalid account details.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users simultaneously performing the same actions.\n    *   Network failures: Simulate network interruptions during transactions.\n    *   Empty states: Handling scenarios with no accounts, no transactions, etc.\n    *   Long input strings: Max length of input fields.\n*   **Security Testing (OWASP Top 10 Basics):**\n    *   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Attempt to inject SQL code into input fields.\n    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attempt to inject JavaScript code into input fields.\n    *   **Broken Authentication:** Test for weak password policies and session management.\n    *   **Input Validation:** Strict validation of all input fields to prevent malicious data.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   Utilize a combination of static and dynamically generated test data.\n    *   Static data:  A set of pre-defined valid and invalid user credentials.\n    *   Dynamic data:  Generate account numbers, amounts, and other transaction details programmatically to cover a wider range of scenarios.  Consider using a data generation library (e.g., Faker).\n    *   Data Reset: Implement a mechanism to reset the database to a known clean state before each test run.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1. Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended.  Each page of the application should be represented as a Page Object, encapsulating the page's elements and actions. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n*   **Language:** Choose a language appropriate for the team skill set (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript).\n*   **Test Runner:** JUnit, TestNG (Java); pytest (Python); Mocha, Jest (JavaScript).\n*   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ (Java), Pytest assertions (Python), Chai (JavaScript).\n*   **Reporting:** Generate detailed test reports (e.g., Allure, Extent Reports).\n\n### 3.2. Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  When waiting for elements to appear or state changes, use polling assertions with explicit timeouts instead of implicit waits. This reduces flakiness due to timing issues.\n*   **Implement Self-Healing:** If possible, implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors (e.g., retrying failed requests, re-logging in after a session timeout).\n*   **Test Data Management:** Ensure test data is properly cleaned up after each test to avoid conflicts and unexpected behavior.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1. Mining Targets\n\nPrioritize the following pages/flows for initial test automation:\n\n1.  **Registration Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/register.htm` - Cover all input fields and validation rules.\n2.  **Login Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm` -  Focus on valid and invalid login attempts.\n3.  **Account Summary Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/summary.htm` - Verify account details are displayed correctly after login.\n4.  **Transfer Funds Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/transfer.htm` - Cover various transfer scenarios (same account, different accounts, insufficient funds).\n5.  **Request Loan Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/requestloan.htm` - Validate loan application process with different inputs.\n\n### 4.2. Verification Criteria\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all requests return the expected HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK for successful requests, 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors).\n*   **Text Visibility:** Verify the presence of expected text on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, confirmation messages after transactions).\n*   **Data Validation:** Verify that data is correctly displayed in the UI (e.g., account balances, transaction history).\n*   **Error Messages:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input.\n*   **Database Verification (If Possible):**  Validate data integrity by directly querying the database (if access is available) to confirm that transactions are correctly recorded.  This is an advanced technique but highly valuable.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing ParaBank. Consistent application of these principles will ensure a high-quality and reliable application. This document should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the application and the testing environment."
