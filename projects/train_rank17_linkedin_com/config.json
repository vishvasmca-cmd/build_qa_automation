  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: LinkedIn Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the LinkedIn website smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** LinkedIn is a professional networking platform. Failure of core functionalities can lead to user frustration, loss of trust, and potential business impact (e.g., inability to connect with potential employers/employees).\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** High. While not directly transactional like e-commerce, LinkedIn's reliability is crucial for professional networking and recruitment. Outages or critical bugs can significantly impact user experience and brand reputation.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence of key UI elements on the homepage (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of HTTP status codes (200 OK).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of each button/link/menu item.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing (initially).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the LinkedIn website is accessible and the core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to `https://linkedin.com` and verify the page loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify the \"Sign up\" or \"Get Started\" button is present on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button is present on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Generic):** Verify the presence of 5 distinct buttons on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Presence (Generic):** Verify the presence of 2 distinct links on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (Generic):** Verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For this smoke test, no specific test data is required. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM). Even for a simple smoke test, POM provides a structured approach for locating and interacting with UI elements. This will be beneficial as the test suite expands in the future.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` class that encapsulates the locators for the Login button, Signup button, Try for Free button, links, buttons and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitForElementVisible`) to handle potential delays in element loading. This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **LinkedIn Homepage (`https://linkedin.com`):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"LinkedIn\".\n    2.  **UI Element Presence:**\n        *   Login Button: Element is visible and enabled.\n        *   Signup/GetStarted Button: Element is visible and enabled.\n        *   Try for Free Button: Element is visible and enabled.\n        *   Button Presence (Generic): 5 distinct button elements are visible.\n        *   Link Presence (Generic): 2 distinct link elements are visible.\n        *   Menu Bar Presence (Generic): 2 distinct menu bar elements are visible.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed test cases, including screenshots or videos if possible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for the LinkedIn smoke test. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a reliable and efficient testing process."
