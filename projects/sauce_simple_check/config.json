Here's the Master Test Strategy document for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing for the login page and username field verification.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Login Page Regression\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com (E-commerce Demo)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n**Author:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo.com is an e-commerce demo application. While not a real-world production system, it simulates typical e-commerce functionality. The login page is a critical entry point. Failure here prevents users from accessing the application and completing transactions.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Impact of Failure:** Inability to access the application, preventing users from browsing products, adding items to the cart, and completing purchases. This translates to a loss of potential revenue (in a real-world scenario) and damage to user trust.\n*   **Severity:** High. Login failure is a blocker.\n*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. The login page is a relatively simple component, but susceptible to issues related to authentication, session management, and security vulnerabilities.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Login page functionality (username, password, login button).\n*   Error handling for invalid credentials.\n*   Security aspects related to login (e.g., password encryption, protection against brute-force attacks).\n*   Accessibility of the login page.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility of the login page.\n*   Performance of the login page (load time).\n*   Username field validation (e.g., character limits, allowed characters).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Functionality beyond the login page (product catalog, shopping cart, checkout).\n*   Detailed performance testing beyond initial load time.\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n*   API testing (unless directly related to login functionality).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will verify the basic functionality of the login page.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    *   Verify the username field is present and visible.\n    *   Verify the password field is present and visible.\n    *   Verify the login button is present and visible.\n    *   Attempt login with valid credentials (standard_user/secret_sauce) and verify successful redirection to the inventory page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will cover a wider range of scenarios and edge cases.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid Username: Attempt login with invalid usernames (e.g., special characters, empty string).\n    *   Invalid Password: Attempt login with invalid passwords (e.g., special characters, empty string).\n    *   Username/Password Combinations: Test various combinations of valid and invalid usernames and passwords.\n    *   SQL Injection: Attempt login with usernames/passwords containing SQL injection payloads.\n    *   XSS: Attempt login with usernames/passwords containing XSS payloads.\n    *   Brute Force: Simulate multiple failed login attempts to check for account lockout mechanisms.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Long Username/Password: Test with usernames and passwords exceeding typical length limits.\n    *   Special Characters: Test with usernames and passwords containing special characters (e.g., Unicode characters).\n    *   Empty Fields: Attempt login with empty username and/or password fields.\n    *   Whitespace: Test with leading/trailing whitespace in username and password fields.\n    *   Case Sensitivity: Verify username and password case sensitivity (or insensitivity, as appropriate).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   OWASP Top 10 Basics: Focus on input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n    *   Password Encryption: Verify that passwords are encrypted in transit and at rest.\n    *   Session Management: Verify secure session management practices.\n*   **Username Field Validation:**\n    *   Character Limits: Verify the maximum allowed length of the username field.\n    *   Allowed Characters: Verify the allowed characters in the username field (e.g., alphanumeric, underscores).\n    *   Error Messages: Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid username inputs.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Valid and invalid usernames and passwords will be stored in a configuration file or database.  The standard valid user credentials will be included.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  For certain negative testing scenarios (e.g., long usernames, special characters), data will be generated dynamically using code.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be managed in a way that allows for easy modification and reuse.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent the login page and its elements. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Language:** [Choose a language based on team expertise - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript]\n*   **Testing Framework:** [Choose a testing framework - e.g., Selenium WebDriver with JUnit/TestNG (Java), pytest (Python), Cypress/Playwright (JavaScript)]\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and potential timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common issues (e.g., element not found). This could involve retrying element lookups or refreshing the page.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for flaky tests related to network issues or browser instability.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent (if used) should prioritize the following pages/flows:\n\n*   **Login Page (https://www.saucedemo.com/):** Focus on exploring all possible input combinations for the username and password fields.\n*   **Error Message Display:**  Actively seek out and verify the presence and correctness of error messages for invalid login attempts.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   Successful login with valid credentials redirects to the inventory page.\n    *   Error messages are displayed correctly for invalid login attempts.\n    *   The login page loads within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., < 2 seconds).\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present on the login page.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   Inability to log in with valid credentials.\n    *   Incorrect or missing error messages.\n    *   Login page fails to load or takes an excessive amount of time to load.\n    *   JavaScript errors are present on the login page.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities are detected (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\n"
