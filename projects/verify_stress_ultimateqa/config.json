  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: UltimateQA Automation Website\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n**Domain Analysis:** This website appears to be a demo/training site for automation. While not a direct revenue-generating application, failures can impact the user experience, credibility, and potentially lead to loss of training opportunities if critical functionalities are broken.\n\n**Risk Profile:** The risks are primarily related to user experience and trust.\n\n*   **High Risk:** Failure of form submissions, incorrect search results, broken links, and security vulnerabilities.\n*   **Medium Risk:** Performance issues, broken UI elements, minor functional glitches.\n*   **Low Risk:** Cosmetic issues.\n\n**Testing Scope:**\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Functional testing of specified user flows (form submissions, navigation, search).\n    *   Negative testing (invalid inputs, missing fields).\n    *   Basic security testing (input sanitization, prevention of common vulnerabilities).\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox).\n    *   Responsiveness on common screen sizes.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Load testing.\n    *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n    *   Extensive cross-browser/device testing (beyond Chrome and Firefox on common resolutions).\n    *   Detailed performance benchmarking.\n    *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n**Global Testing Strategy:**\n\n*   **SMOKE (Sanity):** A minimal \"Health Check\" suite that will run as part of CI/CD pipeline before more extensive regression testing.\n*   **REGRESSION (Deep Dive):** A comprehensive regression suite ensuring that recent changes have not broken existing functionality.\n\n**Smoke Suite:**\n\n*   Navigate to the target URL: `https://ultimateqa.com/automation`\n*   Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n*   Click 'Big page with many elements' and verify it navigates correctly.\n*   Fill out the Name and Email fields on 'Big page with many elements' with valid values.\n*   Click the button on 'Big page with many elements' and check for no error.\n*   Navigate back to the homepage.\n*   Click 'Fill out forms' and verify it navigates correctly.\n*   Fill out Name and Message fields on 'Fill out forms' with valid values.\n*   Submit the form on 'Fill out forms' and check for no error.\n\n**Regression Suite:**\n\n*   **'Big page with many elements' Flow:**\n    *   *Negative Testing:*\n        *   Invalid email format (e.g., missing @, missing domain).\n        *   Empty name field.\n        *   Fields with special characters.\n    *   *Edge Cases:*\n        *   Very long name.\n        *   Concurrency (multiple users submitting the form simultaneously).\n    *   *Security:*\n        *   Try SQL injection/XSS in name/email fields.\n*   **'Fill out forms' Flow:**\n    *   *Negative Testing:*\n        *   Empty name field.\n        *   Empty message field.\n        *   Message exceeding maximum length (if any).\n    *   *Edge Cases:*\n        *   Very long message.\n    *   *Security:*\n        *   Try SQL injection/XSS in name/message fields.\n*   **'Fake Landing Page' Flow:**\n    *   Click 'View Courses'.\n    *   Search for \"Python\".\n    *   Verify that results are displayed (at least one result should be visible).\n    *   *Negative Testing:*\n        *   Search for a non-existent course. Verify that \"No Results\" or similar message is displayed.\n        *   Empty search query.\n    *   *Edge Cases:*\n        *   Search with special characters.\n        *   Search with very long query.\n*   **Navigation:**\n    *   Verify that all \"Back\" buttons function correctly, returning the user to the previous page.\n    *   Verify all links on the page resolve to the correct target.\n\n**Data Strategy:**\n\n*   Utilize a mix of static and dynamic data.\n*   Static data: Valid email addresses, common names, standard search queries.\n*   Dynamic data: Generate random strings for name/message fields (to ensure uniqueness and avoid caching issues).\n*   Store test data in a separate configuration file (JSON, YAML, etc.).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n**Framework Recommendation:**\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to maintain maintainability and reusability.  Each page on the website should have its own corresponding Page Object class.\n\n**Resilience Strategy:**\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle dynamically loading elements and avoid premature failures due to timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to be visible/clickable/present before interacting with them. Avoid implicit waits as they can be less reliable.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., due to network instability).  Retry failing tests a limited number of times before marking them as failed.\n*   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques (using AI or other mechanisms) to automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n**Mining Targets:**\n\nPrioritize the following pages and flows for initial testing:\n\n1.  `https://ultimateqa.com/automation` (Homepage - Verify all links are working)\n2.  `https://ultimateqa.com/automation` -> 'Big page with many elements' (Form submission, button click)\n3.  `https://ultimateqa.com/automation` -> 'Fill out forms' (Form submission)\n4.  `https://ultimateqa.com/automation` -> 'Fake Landing Page' -> 'View Courses' (Search functionality)\n\n**Verification Criteria:**\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   Page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    *   Elements are visible and interactive.\n    *   Form submissions are successful (no error messages).\n    *   Navigation works as expected.\n    *   Search results are displayed correctly.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   Page fails to load (HTTP error, timeout).\n    *   Elements are missing or not interactive.\n    *   Form submission errors.\n    *   Incorrect navigation.\n    *   Incorrect/missing search results.\n    *   Unexpected exceptions or errors in the browser console.\n*   **Specific criteria:** For each form, verify successful submission by checking for a success message (if one exists), or by checking that the data has been successfully saved (if applicable, but likely unavailable in this test context). For search, verify that at least one result is displayed when searching for \"Python\"."
