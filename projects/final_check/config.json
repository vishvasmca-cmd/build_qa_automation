My mandate is to create a comprehensive Master Test Strategy for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing and the specific user goal of verifying login and logout functionality. Here's the plan:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Login/Logout Regression\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nSaucedemo.com appears to be a demonstration e-commerce application. While not a real-world business, it simulates typical e-commerce flows. The login/logout functionality is fundamental to user access and security.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure of login/logout functionality can lead to:\n\n*   **Access Denial:** Users unable to access the application.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Potential for unauthorized access if authentication is bypassed.\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** If user sessions are not properly managed.\n*   **Negative User Experience:** Frustration and abandonment of the application.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Positive Login:** Successful login with valid credentials.\n*   **Negative Login:** Unsuccessful login attempts with invalid credentials (e.g., incorrect username, incorrect password, locked-out user).\n*   **Logout:** Successful logout functionality.\n*   **Session Management:** Verification that sessions are properly created and destroyed.\n*   **Error Handling:** Proper display of error messages for invalid login attempts.\n*   **Security:** Basic checks for common vulnerabilities related to authentication (e.g., password complexity, account lockout).\n*   **UI/UX:** Validation of the login and logout page elements (labels, buttons, messages).\n*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Basic verification on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed performance testing (load, stress).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n*   Full end-to-end testing of the entire e-commerce flow (beyond login/logout).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Mobile testing (unless specifically requested).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Objective:** Verify basic login and page load functionality.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Successful login with a standard user account.\n    *   Verify successful redirection to the inventory page after login.\n    *   Verify the inventory page loads correctly (elements are visible).\n*   **Data:** Use a predefined \"standard_user\" account.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThis suite will cover a comprehensive set of scenarios for login and logout.\n\n*   **Positive Login:**\n    *   Login with different user roles (e.g., standard user, locked-out user, problem user, performance glitch user).\n    *   Login with valid credentials (various character sets).\n*   **Negative Login:**\n    *   Invalid username.\n    *   Invalid password.\n    *   Both invalid username and password.\n    *   Locked-out user account.\n    *   SQL Injection attempts in username/password fields (basic).\n    *   XSS attempts in username/password fields (basic).\n*   **Logout:**\n    *   Successful logout from the inventory page.\n    *   Verify redirection to the login page after logout.\n    *   Attempt to access the inventory page after logout (should be denied).\n    *   Logout after a period of inactivity (session timeout).\n*   **Error Handling:**\n    *   Verify correct error messages are displayed for invalid login attempts.\n    *   Verify error messages are clear and user-friendly.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Check for password complexity requirements (if any).\n    *   Verify account lockout mechanism after multiple failed login attempts.\n*   **UI/UX:**\n    *   Verify the appearance of login and logout pages (layout, fonts, colors).\n    *   Verify labels and button text are accurate and consistent.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use a set of predefined user accounts with known credentials for positive and negative testing. Store these in a configuration file or data table.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** For security testing (e.g., SQL injection, XSS), generate dynamic data using a library or function.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n    *   Create separate page objects for the Login Page and Inventory Page.\n    *   Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met. This helps to avoid false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed test steps. This can help to overcome intermittent network issues or server-side glitches.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing (Optional):**\n    *   Consider using a self-healing mechanism to automatically locate elements that have changed their locators. This can reduce the maintenance effort required to keep tests up-to-date.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page (/)**: Focus on all input fields (username, password) and the login button.\n2.  **Inventory Page (/inventory.html)**: Verify successful redirection after login.\n3.  **Logout Flow**: Trigger the logout action and verify redirection back to the login page.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   **HTTP 200 OK** for all page requests.\n    *   Successful login redirects to the inventory page.\n    *   Successful logout redirects to the login page.\n    *   Correct error messages are displayed for invalid login attempts.\n    *   No unexpected errors or exceptions are thrown.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Incorrect redirection after login or logout.\n    *   Missing or incorrect error messages.\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n```\n\nThis document provides a solid foundation for the testing effort. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as you learn more about the application and its behavior. Good luck!\n"
