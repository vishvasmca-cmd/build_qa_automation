My mandate is to create a comprehensive Master Test Strategy for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing with specific attention to login and logout functionality. Here's the breakdown:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Login/Logout Regression\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nSaucedemo.com is a demo e-commerce website. While not a real business, it simulates typical e-commerce functionality. Key areas include:\n\n*   **Login/Logout:** User authentication is fundamental.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying and filtering products.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and modifying items.\n*   **Checkout:** Completing the purchase process.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure in Saucedemo.com doesn't directly impact real-world finances or data. However, it can impact:\n\n*   **Trust:** Demonstrates the quality of the underlying testing framework and processes.\n*   **Functionality:** Broken login/logout prevents access to the entire application.\n*   **Reputation:** Poorly tested demo sites reflect badly on the testing team.\n\nTherefore, while the *business* risk is low, the *technical* risk of a poorly executed test strategy is moderate.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Login Functionality:**\n    *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n    *   Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials (username, password, both).\n    *   Account lockout (if implemented).\n    *   Password reset (if implemented).\n    *   Error message validation for incorrect credentials.\n    *   Login with different user roles (if applicable).\n*   **Logout Functionality:**\n    *   Successful logout.\n    *   Session invalidation after logout.\n    *   Attempting to access protected pages after logout.\n*   **Cookie Management:** Verify cookies are set/cleared appropriately during login/logout.\n*   **UI/UX:** Verify the login and logout pages render correctly across different browsers and devices.\n*   **Accessibility:** Basic accessibility checks (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Product catalog functionality (searching, filtering, details).\n*   Shopping cart functionality.\n*   Checkout process.\n*   Performance testing (load, stress).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Purpose:** Verify basic system health.\n*   **Tests:**\n    1.  Navigate to the login page.\n    2.  Login with a valid username and password (e.g., `standard_user` and `secret_sauce`).\n    3.  Verify successful login (e.g., user is redirected to the product catalog page).\n    4.  Logout.\n    5.  Verify successful logout (e.g., user is redirected to the login page).\n*   **Frequency:** Run after every build/deployment.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid username/password combinations.\n    *   SQL injection attempts in username/password fields (basic).\n    *   Empty username/password fields.\n    *   Username/password exceeding maximum length.\n    *   Special characters in username/password fields.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Multiple concurrent login attempts from the same user.\n    *   Session timeout.\n    *   Network interruptions during login/logout.\n    *   Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n    *   Different screen resolutions.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on input fields (username, password).\n    *   Verify password storage practices (hashing, salting - if applicable).\n    *   Check for sensitive information in cookies.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Test Data:** Use a set of predefined usernames and passwords (valid and invalid) stored in a configuration file.\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data (Optional):** If account creation is possible, consider dynamically creating and deleting test accounts.  This adds complexity but increases test coverage.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended.\n    *   Create separate page objects for the Login Page, Product Catalog Page (for verification), and any other relevant pages.\n    *   This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntil` or `waitForElementVisible`) to handle asynchronous operations and potential delays.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI to identify and correct broken locators) for long-term maintainability.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page (`/login` or similar):** Focus on all input fields (username, password), error messages, and the submit button.\n2.  **Post-Login Page (e.g., Product Catalog):** Verify successful login by checking for specific elements or text on this page.\n3.  **Logout Functionality:**  Locate and interact with the logout button/link.\n4.  **Error Messages:** Capture and analyze all error messages displayed during login attempts.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   **HTTP 200 OK:** The page loads successfully.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Key elements (e.g., username field, password field, login button, logout button) are visible.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Specific text (e.g., \"Username\", \"Password\", \"Login\", \"Products\") is present on the page.\n    *   **Redirection:** Successful login redirects to the expected page (e.g., product catalog). Successful logout redirects to the login page.\n    *   **Error Message Validation:**  Correct error messages are displayed for invalid login attempts.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   **HTTP Errors:** Any HTTP error codes (e.g., 400, 401, 500).\n    *   **Element Not Found:** Key elements are missing or cannot be located.\n    *   **Incorrect Redirection:**  Login/logout redirects to an unexpected page.\n    *   **Unexpected Errors:**  Unhandled exceptions or errors are displayed.\n\n```\n"
