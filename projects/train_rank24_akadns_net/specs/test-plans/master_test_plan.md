# Test Plan for train_rank24_akadns_net

## Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the train_rank24_akadns_net project. The primary goal is to ensure the website functions as expected, focusing on core functionalities and critical user flows.

## Scope

The testing will cover the following areas:

*   Website navigation
*   Identification of key elements (buttons, links, menu bars)

## Test Strategy

The testing will be divided into two main suites: Smoke and Regression.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite will focus on verifying the most critical functionalities of the website. The following checklist will be applied:

1.  **Critical Path Coverage:** Tests cover the most common and important user flows.
2.  **Core Functionality:** Focus on essential features required for the website to function.
3.  **Positive Testing:** Primarily focuses on successful scenarios.
4.  **Minimal Data Variation:** Uses a limited set of test data.
5.  **Fast Execution:** Designed to be quick to execute, providing rapid feedback.
6.  **Build Verification:** Used to determine if a build is stable enough for further testing.
7.  **High Priority Defects:** Any failures are treated as high priority.
8.  **Limited Scope:** Excludes edge cases and less common scenarios.

### Regression Suite Strategy

The regression suite will provide a more comprehensive test coverage, including alternative flows, negative scenarios, and boundary analysis. This suite will ensure that new changes do not negatively impact existing functionalities.

## Test Suites

1.  **Smoke Suite:**
    *   Verify website launch and basic element identification.

2.  **Regression Suite:**
    *   (Not defined yet, as the trace is incomplete. It would include more in-depth testing of each element and their interactions.)
