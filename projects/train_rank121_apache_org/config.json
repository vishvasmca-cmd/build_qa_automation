  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Apache.org Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Apache.org is a critical website for the Apache Software Foundation, providing access to open-source projects, documentation, and community resources. While not a direct revenue-generating platform, its availability and functionality are crucial for maintaining the foundation's reputation, supporting its user base, and facilitating project contributions.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failure of Apache.org can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage**: Inability to access projects and resources can negatively impact the foundation's credibility.\n    *   **Community Disruption**: Hinders collaboration and support among developers and users.\n    *   **Project Adoption**: Difficulties in accessing project information can discourage adoption and contribution.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website launch and basic page rendering.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars) on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual projects or downloads.\n        *   Clicking and navigating through links and buttons.\n        *   Form submissions or user authentication.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Website Launch**: Verify the Apache.org homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Button Identification**: Verify the presence of at least five buttons with labels like \"Login,\" \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" \"Try for Free,\" or similar calls to action.\n        3.  **Link Identification**: Verify the presence of at least two links on the homepage.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Identification**: Verify the presence of at least two menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite**: Not applicable for this smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document when the scope expands beyond smoke testing.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Static Data**: No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: While the scope is limited, implementing a basic POM structure will provide a foundation for future test expansion. Create a `HomePage` class to represent the Apache.org homepage and encapsulate locators for buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to handle potential delays in element loading. This helps avoid false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and visible before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Homepage (https://apache.org)**: Focus all exploration on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Website Launch**: HTTP status code 200 (OK) and presence of the Apache logo or website title.\n    *   **Button Identification**: Presence of at least five `button` or `a` elements with relevant text labels (e.g., using XPath or CSS selectors).\n    *   **Link Identification**: Presence of at least two `a` elements with `href` attributes.\n    *   **Menu Bar Identification**: Presence of at least two `nav` or `ul` elements with `li` children, indicating menu items.\n*   **Success Definition**: All verification criteria are met, indicating the website is accessible and key UI elements are present."
