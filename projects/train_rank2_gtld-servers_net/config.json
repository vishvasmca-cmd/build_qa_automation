  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: gtld-servers.net - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the website `https://gtld-servers.net`. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The website `gtld-servers.net` likely provides information or services related to domain name systems (DNS). While not explicitly e-commerce, its availability and correct information are crucial for its intended audience. Failure could lead to misinformation or service disruption.\n*   **Risk Profile:** The primary risks associated with failure are:\n    *   **Informational Accuracy:** Incorrect or unavailable information could mislead users.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Website downtime or errors could damage the organization's credibility.\n    *   **Service Disruption:** If the website provides essential services, unavailability could disrupt those services.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic attributes (e.g., text, visibility).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking or interacting with any elements (buttons, links, menu items).\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):** The smoke suite will consist of the following tests:\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully and returns an HTTP 200 status code.\n    2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button (or equivalent).\n    3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar button.\n    4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" button (or equivalent).\n    5.  **Button Presence (Generic #4):** Verify the presence of another button.\n    6.  **Button Presence (Generic #5):** Verify the presence of another button.\n    7.  **Link Presence (Generic #1):** Verify the presence of a link.\n    8.  **Link Presence (Generic #2):** Verify the presence of a link.\n    9.  **Menu Bar Presence (Generic #1):** Verify the presence of a menu bar.\n    10. **Menu Bar Presence (Generic #2):** Verify the presence of a menu bar.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for smoke testing.* A regression suite will be defined later for more comprehensive testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** A lightweight framework using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended. This will allow for easy maintenance and scalability as testing expands.\n    *   **Page Objects:** Create a base `BasePage` object with common functionalities (e.g., `isElementPresent(locator)`). Create specific page objects for the main page, login page (if applicable), etc.\n    *   **Locators:** Use robust locators (e.g., CSS selectors or XPath) that are less likely to break with UI changes. Prioritize `id` attributes if available.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with a retry mechanism) to handle potential timing issues when verifying element presence. This will reduce flakiness.  Example:  `waitForElementToBeVisible(locator, timeout=5)`\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://gtld-servers.net`):** This is the primary target for identifying the required elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification (Optional):** If possible, verify that the text on the buttons and links is as expected (e.g., \"Login\" button displays the text \"Login\").\n*   **Reporting:** Any failures should be reported immediately with clear descriptions and screenshots.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing `https://gtld-servers.net`. It will be reviewed and updated as the application evolves and testing requirements change."
