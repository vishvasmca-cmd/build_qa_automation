  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Spotify Website - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for smoke testing the Spotify website (https://spotify.com). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Spotify is a music streaming service. The website serves as a primary entry point for new users and a hub for account management. Failure of the website impacts user acquisition and potentially revenue if account management is disrupted.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. Website unavailability leads to user frustration, potential churn, and negative brand perception. Critical failures (e.g., login issues) can severely impact user experience.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, \"Try for Free\" buttons, and other prominent buttons).\n        *   Identification of key links.\n        *   Identification of menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a single primary browser - Chrome).\n        *   Mobile device testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the Spotify website is accessible and the essential UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Spotify homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible.\n        4.  **\"Try for Free\" Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button (or similar call to action) is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Generic x2):** Verify two other prominent buttons are present and visible (e.g., \"Download,\" \"Premium\").\n        6.  **Link Presence (Generic x2):** Verify two prominent links are present and visible (e.g., \"About Us,\" \"Support\").\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (Generic x2):** Verify two menu bars are present and visible (e.g., top navigation, footer navigation).\n*   **Regression Suite:**  *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   Smoke tests do *not* require user data. The focus is on UI element presence, not functionality.\n    *   No test data management is required for the smoke suite.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create Page Objects for the homepage. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n    *   **Language:**  [Choose language - e.g., Python with Selenium, or JavaScript with Playwright].\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_until_visible`) to handle potential loading delays.  A reasonable timeout (e.g., 5-10 seconds) should be implemented.\n    *   **Element Location Strategy:**  Prioritize robust element locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `aria-label`) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test execution in case of transient network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Spotify Homepage (https://spotify.com):** This is the primary target for all smoke tests.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the main page title (e.g., \"Spotify - Web Player: Music for Everyone\").\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are visible on the page. Visibility should be determined using appropriate methods (e.g., `is_displayed()` in Selenium).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed tests, including screenshots.\n*   **Execution Frequency:**\n    *   Smoke tests should be executed on every build (Continuous Integration).\n*   **Failure Handling:**\n    *   Any failure in the smoke suite should immediately halt the build and trigger an investigation by the development team.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the Spotify website. It emphasizes speed, reliability, and maintainability, ensuring that critical issues are identified early in the development lifecycle."
