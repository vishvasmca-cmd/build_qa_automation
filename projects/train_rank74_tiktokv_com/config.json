  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: TikTokv.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the TikTokv.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the initial testing efforts to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** TikTokv.com is a video-sharing social networking service. Its business criticality lies in user engagement, content delivery, and platform stability.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities (login, signup, content loading) can lead to significant user dissatisfaction, loss of engagement, and potential reputational damage.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons).\n        *   Identification of links on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons and links (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed content loading and playback.\n        *   User profile management.\n        *   Video uploading.\n        *   Mobile app testing.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS verification).\n        *   Error handling and negative scenarios.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and the core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the TikTokv.com website loads successfully in a supported browser.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify a fourth button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify a fifth button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a first link is present and visible on the homepage.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify a second link is present and visible on the homepage.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a first menu bar is present and visible on the homepage.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify a second menu bar is present and visible on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* This document focuses solely on the initial smoke test.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For smoke tests, no specific test data is required as we are only verifying the presence of UI elements.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework using Selenium or Playwright with a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended. This allows for easy identification and verification of UI elements.\n    *   Example POM structure:\n        *   `HomePage.java` (or `.py`, `.js`, etc.) - Contains locators and methods for interacting with the homepage.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Mitigation:**\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a simple retry mechanism for element identification, in case of intermittent loading issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: The primary focus is the homepage of TikTokv.com.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code AND the presence of the main page title.\n    *   **Button/Link/Menu Bar Presence:** The specified button/link/menu bar element is present in the DOM and is visible on the page.  Visibility should be determined by checking the `isDisplayed()` method in Selenium or equivalent in other frameworks.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise reporting of test results.\n    *   Immediate notification of any failures to the development team.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the initial smoke testing of TikTokv.com. Adherence to this strategy will ensure a stable foundation for further testing and development efforts."
