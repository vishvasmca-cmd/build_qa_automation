  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Google Ad Services - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the Google Ad Services website (https://googleadservices.com). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Google Ad Services is a critical component of Google's advertising ecosystem. Failure in this area can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and disruption for advertisers and publishers.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** System unavailability or critical functionality failure (e.g., login) can directly impact revenue generation and advertiser trust.\n    *   **Medium:** Issues with core navigation or accessibility can hinder user adoption and satisfaction.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar CTAs), 5 distinct buttons, 2 distinct links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic accessibility (no broken links).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality testing of any specific feature.\n        *   Clicking any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Form submission or data validation.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited to a single, primary browser - Chrome).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS verification).\n        *   Error handling.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to https://googleadservices.com and verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Element Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button or link.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar call-to-action button or link.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" or similar call-to-action button or link.\n        5.  **Button Count:** Verify the presence of at least 5 distinct buttons on the page.\n        6.  **Link Count:** Verify the presence of at least 2 distinct links on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Count:** Verify the presence of at least 2 distinct menu bars on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.*  Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for the smoke tests. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create a base `Page` class for common functionalities (e.g., `isElementPresent`) and specific page object classes for each section of the Google Ad Services website.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be present) to handle potential timing issues during page load.  A reasonable timeout (e.g., 5-10 seconds) should be implemented.\n    *   **Element Location Strategy:** Prioritize robust element locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `aria-label`) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://googleadservices.com):** Focus on identifying the Login, Signup/Get Started, and Try for Free elements, as well as buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Element is visible on the page and not hidden by CSS or JavaScript.\n    *   **Button/Link/Menu Bar Counts:** The number of buttons, links, and menu bars found on the page meets the specified criteria.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed tests, including screenshots and relevant log information.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for ensuring the stability and reliability of the Google Ad Services website. It will be reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in the application and business requirements."
