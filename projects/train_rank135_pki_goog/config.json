  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: pki.goog - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the pki.goog website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated smoke tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The pki.goog website likely provides information and resources related to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). While not directly transactional (e.g., e-commerce), its availability and accuracy are crucial for users relying on its information for security-related decisions.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the pki.goog website could lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose confidence in Google's PKI resources.\n    *   **Information Access Issues:** Users may be unable to access critical information regarding PKI.\n    *   **Indirect Security Risks:** If users cannot access information, they may make incorrect security decisions.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Verification of HTTP 200 status for the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing beyond basic availability.\n        *   Error handling.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of:\n            *   At least one element with text containing \"Login\" (case-insensitive).\n            *   At least one element with text containing \"Signup\" OR \"GetStarted\" (case-insensitive).\n            *   At least one element with text containing \"Try for Free\" (or similar call to action - case-insensitive).\n            *   At least 5 distinct button elements (`<button>`).\n            *   At least 2 distinct link elements (`<a>`).\n            *   At least 2 distinct menu bar elements (identified by common CSS classes like `menu`, `navbar`, `nav`).\n*   **Regression Suite:**  *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.*  Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** While the smoke test is simple, using POM from the start will facilitate future expansion into regression testing. Create a `HomePage` object containing locators for the elements to be verified.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntil` or `waitForElementVisible`) to handle potential delays in element rendering.  Set a reasonable timeout (e.g., 5-10 seconds).\n    *   **Locator Strategy:** Prioritize robust locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `aria-label`) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://pki.goog):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage Load:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) must be present on the page within the defined timeout.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed tests, including locator information and screenshots.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the pki.goog website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality of the website is verified quickly and efficiently."
