  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for the GitHub.io website, focusing on a smoke test scenario. This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: GitHub.io Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** GitHub.io is a web hosting service primarily used for static websites. While the content hosted varies widely, the platform itself needs to be stable. Failure of the core platform impacts all hosted sites.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Platform unavailability leads to widespread website outages.\n    *   **Medium:** Issues with core navigation elements (links, buttons) hinder user access to content.\n    *   **Low:** Minor visual glitches on specific pages.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key navigation elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons).\n        *   Identification of links and menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed content validation on hosted websites.\n        *   Clicking and navigating through links and buttons (beyond identification).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially, focus on desktop).\n        *   Error handling (e.g., 404 pages).\n        *   Security testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the GitHub.io website is accessible and core navigation elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the GitHub.io URL loads successfully.\n        2.  **Button Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 5 of the following buttons: \"Login,\" \"Sign up,\" \"Get Started,\" \"Try for Free,\" or other similar call-to-action buttons on the homepage.\n        3.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for this smoke test strategy.* A regression suite would be defined later to cover deeper functionality.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The tests primarily focus on UI element presence.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class representing the GitHub.io homepage.\n        *   Within `HomePage`, define elements (buttons, links, menu bars) as properties.\n        *   Create methods to interact with these elements (e.g., `isLoginButtonPresent()`, `isSignupLinkPresent()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to check for element presence. This handles cases where elements load asynchronously. Example: `waitUntilElementIsVisible(loginButton, timeout=5)`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for initial page load failures. This can handle transient network issues.\n    *   **Element Existence Check:** Before interacting with an element, explicitly check if it exists on the page to avoid `NoSuchElementException`.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **GitHub.io Homepage (https://github.io):** This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) is returned.\n    *   **Button Identification:** The test should assert that at least 5 buttons with relevant text (e.g., \"Login\", \"Sign up\") are present on the page. Use `element.isDisplayed()` or similar methods.\n    *   **Link Identification:** The test should assert that at least 2 links are present on the page.  Use `element.isDisplayed()` or similar methods.\n    *   **Menu Bar Identification:** The test should assert that at least 2 menu bars are present on the page. Use `element.isDisplayed()` or similar methods.\n*   **Success Definition:** All verification criteria are met. If any criterion fails, the smoke test fails, indicating a critical issue.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for building and executing a smoke test suite for GitHub.io. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical functionalities and providing architectural guidance for creating a resilient and maintainable test framework. Remember that this is a starting point, and the strategy should be reviewed and updated as the application evolves."
