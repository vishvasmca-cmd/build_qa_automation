  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: Uber.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** Senior QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis Master Test Plan outlines the strategy for performing a smoke test suite on Uber's website (uber.com). The primary goal is to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational and that users can successfully navigate to the homepage, verify key content, and initiate the sign-up process.  This plan will guide the autonomous agents on what to mine, what to verify, and how to structure the suite.\n\n## 2. Domain Information and Analysis\n\n*   **Website URL:** <https://www.uber.com>\n*   **Business Domain:** E-commerce (Ride Sharing, Delivery Services)\n*   **Primary Goal:**  Connect users with transportation and delivery services.\n*   **Key Functionality:** Ride booking, delivery ordering, account management, pricing and payment processing.\n\n**Domain Analysis:**\n\nUber's website serves as the primary interface for customers to access its ride-sharing and delivery services. The site is likely built on a complex architecture involving dynamic content, APIs, and integrations with mapping and payment gateways. Therefore, even basic functionality needs to be checked regularly.\n\n## 3. Scope of Smoke Test\n\nThe smoke test suite will cover the following critical areas:\n\n*   Website Availability and Basic Functionality\n*   Homepage Content Verification\n*   Core User Flow: Ride Sign-Up Initiation\n\n**Out-of-Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed testing of all features (e.g., payment processing, map integration, specific ride options)\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited scope)\n*   Performance testing\n*   Security testing\n*   Accessibility testing\n\n## 4. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThis section details the test cases to be included in the smoke test suite.\n\n### 4.1 Website Availability and Core Navigation\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the Uber website is accessible and loads successfully.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to <https://www.uber.com>\n        2.  Verify the page loads without errors (HTTP status code 200).\n    *   **Expected Result:** The Uber homepage should load completely and display the expected layout and content.\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the main navigation menu links are functional.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Locate the main navigation menu (e.g., \"Ride\", \"Drive\", \"Deliver\", \"Help\").\n        2.  Click on each main navigation link.\n        3.  Verify that each link navigates to the expected corresponding page.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Each navigation link should redirect to the correct page without errors.\n\n### 4.2 Homepage Content Verification\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n    *   **Description:** Verify the presence and correctness of the hero headline on the homepage.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to <https://www.uber.com>\n        2.  Locate the main hero headline.\n        3.  Verify that the headline contains the text \"Get a ride in minutes\".\n    *   **Expected Result:** The hero headline should be present and contain the specified text.\n\n### 4.3 Core User Flow: Ride Sign-Up Initiation\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-004\n    *   **Description:** Verify the 'Sign Up to Ride' button is present and functional, leading to the registration page.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to <https://www.uber.com>\n        2.  Locate the \"Sign Up to Ride\" button.\n        3.  Click the \"Sign Up to Ride\" button.\n        4.  Verify that the page redirects to the sign-up page.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The \"Sign Up to Ride\" button should redirect the user to the account registration page.\n\n## 5. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThis section instructs the autonomous agent on how to prioritize element discovery and interaction.\n\n*   **Prioritized Elements:**\n    *   **Main Navigation Menu:**  Specifically, identify links with text labels \"Ride\", \"Drive\", \"Deliver\", and \"Help\".  Extract the `href` attribute for each link to verify navigation.\n    *   **Hero Headline:** Focus on identifying the largest heading element (`<h1>` or `<h2>`) within the main content area of the homepage. This usually contains the key marketing message.\n    *   **\"Sign Up to Ride\" Button:**  Prioritize buttons or links with the exact text \"Sign Up to Ride\", or similar variations (e.g., \"Sign Up\", \"Create Account\") that clearly indicate ride signup. Also check aria labels.\n    *   **Page Titles:** Extract the `<title>` tag content on each page visited to confirm that the correct page is being displayed.\n*   **Mining Strategy:**\n    *   **Homepage Analysis:** On initial page load, immediately scan the DOM for the prioritized elements.\n    *   **Navigation Following:** After clicking a navigation link, verify the page title and re-scan for the prioritized elements, especially if the target page should contain a signup button.\n*   **Data to Extract:**\n    *   `href` attributes of navigation links.\n    *   Text content of the hero headline.\n    *   The presence and clickability of the \"Sign Up to Ride\" button.\n    *   HTTP status code for each page load.\n    *   `<title>` tag content for each page.\n\n## 6. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:**  Platform independent.  (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection.\n\n## 7. Reporting\n\n*   Any test failure will be immediately reported with detailed information, including:\n    *   Test Case ID\n    *   Error message\n    *   Screenshot (if applicable)\n    *   Timestamp\n    *   URL at the time of failure\n\n## 8. Success Criteria\n\n*   All smoke test cases must pass to consider the build stable enough for further testing.\n*   Any failure indicates a critical issue that needs immediate attention.\n\n## 9. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to include more critical user flows (e.g., placing a ride order, checking ride pricing).\n*   Integrate the smoke test suite into the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.\n*   Add cross-browser testing to the smoke test suite."
