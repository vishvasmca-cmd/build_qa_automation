  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Discord Website - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the Discord website (https://discord.com). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Discord is a communication platform. Website availability and basic functionality (login, signup) are critical for user acquisition and retention.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core website functionality can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of New Users:** Potential users unable to sign up or access the platform.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception of the platform's reliability.\n    *   **Reduced User Engagement:** Existing users unable to access the platform.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, 2 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of each button/link/menu item.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the Discord homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is visible on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button is visible on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify another button is visible on the homepage.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify another button is visible on the homepage.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a link is visible on the homepage.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify another link is visible on the homepage.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is visible on the homepage.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify another menu bar is visible on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** _(Not applicable for Smoke Testing. This section would be populated in a full Regression Test Strategy document.)_\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Discord homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class containing locators for the Login, Signup, Try for Free buttons, other buttons, links, and menu bars.\n        *   Methods within the `HomePage` class should focus on interacting with these elements (e.g., `isLoginButtonPresent()`, `isSignupButtonPresent()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays.  This avoids false failures due to elements not being immediately visible.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to be present and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Discord Homepage (https://discord.com):** This is the primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP 200 status code AND page title contains \"Discord\".\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** Element is visible on the page (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()` in Selenium).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed tests, including screenshots or videos where applicable.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for smoke testing the Discord website. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure the stability and reliability of the platform's core functionality."
