  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Shifen.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the Shifen.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Version:** 1.0\n**Target URL:** https://shifen.com\n**Business Domain:** General Web\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Shifen.com appears to be a general web platform. Without specific knowledge of its core business, we will assume a moderate risk profile. Failure of core functionalities could lead to user frustration, loss of potential customers, and damage to brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Moderate. System failures could result in user churn and negative brand perception.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action) buttons (5 total).\n        *   Presence and accessibility of 2 links.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicking).\n        *   Form validation.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   API testing.\n        *   Database testing.\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of 5 buttons (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, and 2 others).\n        3.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of 2 links.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of 2 menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* A comprehensive regression suite will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Smoke Tests:** No specific test data is required for the smoke tests as we are only verifying the presence of elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Recommended for maintainability and reusability. Create a base `HomePage` object containing locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitForElementVisible`) to handle potential loading delays, especially for elements that may be rendered dynamically.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for website availability test in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: Focus on identifying the 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Availability:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Presence:**\n        *   Elements are present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n        *   Elements are visible on the page.\n        *   Elements are enabled (not disabled).\n    *   **Specific Element Identifiers (Examples - to be confirmed):**\n        *   Login Button: Look for elements with text \"Login\", \"Sign In\", or similar.\n        *   Signup/GetStarted Button: Look for elements with text \"Sign Up\", \"Get Started\", \"Register\", or similar.\n        *   Try for Free Button: Look for elements with text \"Try for Free\", \"Free Trial\", or similar.\n        *   Links: Identify any two links present on the page.\n        *   Menu Bars: Identify the main navigation menu and any secondary menu (e.g., footer menu).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing smoke tests on Shifen.com. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality of the website is verified effectively and efficiently."
