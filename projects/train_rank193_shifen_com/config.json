  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: shifen.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for smoke testing the shifen.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** shifen.com appears to be a general web application. Without further information, we assume a moderate business criticality. Failure to load the website or critical elements could lead to user frustration and potential loss of engagement.\n*   **Risk Profile:** The primary risk is a broken or inaccessible website, leading to a negative user experience and potential loss of credibility.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence and visibility of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, 5 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu bars (no clicking).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Detailed content validation.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Navigate to `https://shifen.com` and verify the page loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element Check:** Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Element Check:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"GetStarted\" button/link is present and visible.\n        4.  **Button Count Check:** Verify at least 5 other buttons are present and visible.\n        5.  **Link Count Check:** Verify at least 2 links are present and visible.\n        6.  **Menu Bar Count Check:** Verify at least 2 menu bars are present and visible.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing. This document focuses solely on the initial smoke test strategy.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on element presence rather than data input.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke testing. Consider using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure for maintainability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java` (or equivalent): Contains locators for Login, Signup, buttons, links, and menu bars.\n        *   `HomePage.verifyElementsPresent()`: Method to assert the presence of all required elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use short polling intervals (e.g., 500ms) with a timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) to handle potential loading delays. This prevents false failures due to elements not being immediately visible.\n    *   **Example:** Instead of `Assert.assertTrue(loginButton.isDisplayed())`, use a polling assertion that retries the check for a few seconds.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  `https://shifen.com` (Homepage)\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the main page content (e.g., a specific heading or logo).\n    *   **Element Presence:** Each specified element (Login, Signup, buttons, links, menu bars) must be visible on the page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing shifen.com. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a stable and reliable website launch."
