# Test Plan: train_rank193_shifen_com

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the train_rank193_shifen_com project. It details the scope, strategy, and approach to testing the application, ensuring its quality and reliability.

## 2. Scope

The testing will cover the core functionalities of the application, focusing on identifying key elements such as buttons, links, and menu bars.

## 3. Test Strategy

We will employ a risk-based testing approach, prioritizing the most critical functionalities. The testing will be divided into two main suites: Smoke and Regression.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The Smoke Suite will focus on verifying the basic functionality of the application. The following checklist will be applied:

1.  **Critical Paths:** Cover the most important user flows.
2.  **Core Business Logic:** Verify the primary functions.
3.  **Positive Testing:** Focus on expected behavior.
4.  **Minimal Data Sets:** Use small, representative data sets.
5.  **Fast Execution:** Tests should run quickly.
6.  **Build Acceptance:** Used to determine if a build is stable enough for further testing.
7.  **Limited Scope:** Only essential functionalities are included.
8.  **Automated:** Designed for automated execution.

### Regression Suite Strategy

The Regression Suite will ensure that new changes haven't introduced defects into existing functionality. This suite will include:

*   Alternative Flows
*   Negative Scenarios
*   Boundary Analysis
*   Cross-Module Interactions
*   Validation Messages

## 4. Test Environment

The tests will be executed on a stable test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.

## 5. Test Deliverables

*   Test Plan Document
*   Test Cases (Gherkin Feature Files)
*   Test Execution Reports
*   Defect Reports

## 6. Test вход

*   Trace Data
*   Domain Knowledge
*   Project Requirements
