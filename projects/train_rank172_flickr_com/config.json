  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Flickr Website - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Flickr website (https://flickr.com). It serves as the blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Flickr is a photo and video sharing and hosting service. Its business criticality lies in user engagement, content upload/download, and account management.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities (login, signup, content display) leads to user frustration, loss of trust, and potential churn. Security vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches and reputational damage.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action buttons).\n        *   Presence of at least 5 distinct buttons on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of at least 2 distinct links on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed functionality of any feature.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the basic health of the Flickr website.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Flickr homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of Login, Signup/Get Started, and Try for Free (or similar) buttons.\n        3.  **Button Count:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons on the homepage.\n        4.  **Link Count:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        5.  **Menu Bar Count:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for Smoke Testing, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   This suite will be developed later and will include more comprehensive tests covering all functionalities, edge cases, and negative scenarios.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For smoke tests, static data is sufficient. No dynamic data generation is required. The focus is on element presence, not data validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Flickr homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the Flickr homepage (e.g., `loginButton`, `signupButton`, `getMenuBars()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for elements to load. This will reduce flakiness.\n    *   **Element Existence Checks:** Before interacting with an element, explicitly check if it exists on the page to avoid `NoSuchElementException`.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Flickr Homepage (https://flickr.com):** This is the primary focus for smoke testing.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the page title contains \"Flickr\".\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present in the DOM (Document Object Model). Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify the elements.\n    *   **Button Count:** The number of buttons found on the homepage is greater than or equal to 5.\n    *   **Link Count:** The number of links found on the homepage is greater than or equal to 2.\n    *   **Menu Bar Count:** The number of menu bars found on the homepage is greater than or equal to 2."
