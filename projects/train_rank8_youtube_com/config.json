  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: YouTube Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the YouTube website smoke test. It serves as the guiding document for all testing activities related to ensuring the core functionality of the YouTube platform is operational.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** YouTube is a critical video-sharing platform. Failure impacts content creators, viewers, and Google's revenue streams.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failure leads to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Disrupted ad revenue.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of user trust and potential migration to competitor platforms.\n    *   **Content Creator Impact:** Inability to upload and monetize content.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Video playback functionality.\n        *   Search functionality.\n        *   User account management (beyond identifying the entry points).\n        *   Any interaction with UI elements (clicking, form submission, etc.).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a single primary browser - Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the YouTube website is accessible and the core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the YouTube homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar account creation button is visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar button is visible.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Generic):** Verify any 5 buttons are visible on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Presence (Generic):** Verify any 2 links are visible on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify any 2 menu bars are visible on the homepage.\n    *   **Data Strategy:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the YouTube homepage. Each UI element (Login button, Signup button, etc.) should be a property within the `HomePage` object. This promotes maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible`) to handle potential loading delays. This prevents false failures due to elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and log informative messages. This aids in debugging and identifying the root cause of failures.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **YouTube Homepage (https://youtube.com):** This is the primary focus for identifying UI elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 (OK)\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"YouTube\"\n    *   **UI Element Presence:**\n        *   Element is visible on the page.\n        *   Element is enabled (if applicable).\n        *   Element text matches expected values (e.g., \"Login\" button text is \"Login\").\n*   **Success Definition:** All test cases in the Smoke Suite pass consistently. A single failure indicates a critical issue requiring immediate investigation.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing the YouTube smoke test. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the core functionality of the platform is validated effectively and efficiently."
