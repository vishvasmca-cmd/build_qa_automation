  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: cdn-apple.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for smoke testing the cdn-apple.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** cdn-apple.com is a content delivery network (CDN) for Apple. While not directly customer-facing, its stability is critical for delivering Apple's web content and services. Failure can lead to website outages, impacting brand reputation and potentially revenue.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Website unavailability, broken links, inability to access key resources.\n    *   **Impact:** Brand damage, potential revenue loss (if CDN failure impacts e-commerce), user frustration.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars) on the homepage.\n        *   Verification of the presence of specific text elements (e.g., \"Login\", \"Signup\", \"Try for Free\").\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any buttons or links.\n        *   Navigation to other pages beyond the homepage.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button (or similar) is present.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button (or similar) is present.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Additional 2):** Verify the presence of two other prominent buttons on the homepage (e.g., \"Learn More\", \"Buy Now\").\n        6.  **Link Presence (2):** Verify the presence of two links on the homepage (e.g., \"Privacy Policy\", \"Terms of Use\").\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Verify the presence of two menu bars (e.g., \"Products\", \"Support\").\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create a `HomePage` Page Object to encapsulate locators and interactions with the homepage elements. This promotes maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays. This prevents false failures due to elements not being immediately available. Example: `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.LINK_TEXT, \"Privacy Policy\")))`\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Locator Strategy:** Prioritize robust locators (e.g., `id`, `data-testid`) over fragile locators (e.g., `xpath` based on position).\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (cdn-apple.com):** This is the primary focus.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage Load:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the page.\n    *   **No Exceptions:** The test execution should not throw any exceptions (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages and screenshots for any failed test cases.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the cdn-apple.com website. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a reliable and efficient testing process."
