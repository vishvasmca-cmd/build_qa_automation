  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Vungle.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Vungle.com website smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Vungle.com operates in the mobile advertising space. Website availability and accessibility are crucial for attracting new clients and maintaining existing relationships. Failure to load or access key areas of the site directly impacts lead generation and brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Website downtime or inaccessibility can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Missed opportunities for new business and potential loss of existing clients.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception of Vungle's reliability and professionalism.\n    *   **Loss of Trust:** Erosion of confidence from potential and current partners.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic attributes (e.g., text, visibility).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Navigation between pages.\n        *   Form submission.\n        *   Detailed functional testing.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness testing (initially, focus on desktop).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Vungle.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Element Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button/link is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button Count:** Verify at least 5 buttons are present on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Count:** Verify at least 2 links are present on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Count:** Verify at least 2 menu bars are present on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite (Not applicable for this smoke test)**\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** While a full POM might be overkill for this simple smoke test, it's good practice to start with a basic POM structure for future expansion. Create a `HomePage` class that encapsulates the locators for the key elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with reasonable timeouts to handle potential loading delays. This prevents false failures due to elements not being immediately visible. For example, use a wait condition to ensure the page is fully loaded before attempting to locate elements.\n    *   **Example (Conceptual):** `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.LINK_TEXT, \"Login\")))`\n    *   **Self-Healing (Low Priority):** For this smoke test, self-healing is not a primary concern. However, consider using more robust locators (e.g., CSS selectors with specific attributes) to minimize the impact of minor UI changes.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://vungle.com):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   **Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND the page title contains \"Vungle\".\n    *   **Element Presence:**\n        *   **Success:** The element is present in the DOM AND is visible on the page. Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify the elements.\n        *   **Failure:** The element is not found OR is not visible.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clearly report any failures with detailed information, including the specific test case, the element that failed to be found, and any relevant error messages.\n    *   Provide screenshots of the page in case of failure.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing the Vungle.com smoke test. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality."
