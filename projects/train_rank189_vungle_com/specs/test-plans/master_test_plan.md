# Test Plan: train_rank189_vungle_com

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the train_rank189_vungle_com project, focusing on testing the core functionality of the Vungle website. The plan includes smoke and regression test suites to ensure the quality and stability of the application.

## 2. Scope

The testing will cover the Vungle website, focusing on identifying key elements like buttons and links without interacting with them. This includes verifying the presence and accessibility of these elements.

## 3. Test Strategy

The testing strategy includes two main suites: Smoke and Regression.

### 3.1. Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite will focus on verifying the most critical functionalities of the application. This includes ensuring that key elements are present and accessible.

**8-Point Smoke Suite Checklist:**

1.  **Critical Paths:** Verify the presence of essential UI elements (buttons, links).
2.  **Core Business Logic:** N/A (Focus on UI element identification).
3.  **Positive Testing:** Confirm the existence of elements.
4.  **No Negative Testing:** N/A.
5.  **No Complex Edge Cases:** N/A.
6.  **Fast Execution:** Smoke tests should run quickly.
7.  **Independent Tests:** Tests should be independent of each other.
8.  **Automated:** Designed for automation.

### 3.2. Regression Suite Strategy

The regression suite will cover a broader range of tests, including alternative flows, negative scenarios, and boundary analysis. This suite will ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.

## 4. Test Environment

The tests will be executed in a standard web browser environment.

## 5. Test Deliverables

*   Test Plan Document
*   Test Automation Scripts (Gherkin feature files)
*   Test Execution Reports

## 6. Test вход

*   Trace Data
*   Vungle Website URL

## 7. Test Cases

Test cases will be derived from the trace data and domain knowledge, focusing on identifying buttons and links on the Vungle website.
