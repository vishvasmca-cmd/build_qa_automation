  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SoundCloud Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the SoundCloud application, specifically focusing on the Smoke Test suite. This strategy is designed to ensure the core functionality of the application is operational and ready for further, more in-depth testing.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** SoundCloud is a music and audio platform. Core functionality includes website launch, user authentication (login/signup), and navigation. Failure in these areas directly impacts user access and engagement.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionality can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of User Engagement:** Users unable to access the platform will likely seek alternatives.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Public perception of the platform's reliability will decrease.\n    *   **Potential Revenue Loss:** If premium features are inaccessible, revenue streams are directly impacted.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Existence and accessibility of key UI elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action buttons).\n        *   Existence of at least 5 buttons and 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Existence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of each button/link (e.g., actual login process, signup flow).\n        *   Audio playback functionality.\n        *   Search functionality.\n        *   User profile management.\n        *   Any functionality beyond the initial page load and UI element verification.\n        *   Mobile App testing.\n        *   API testing.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the SoundCloud website is accessible and the essential UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the SoundCloud homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and clickable (no action required).\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and clickable (no action required).\n        4.  **Try for Free Button:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" (or similar) button is present and clickable (no action required).\n        5.  **Button Count:** Verify at least 5 buttons are present on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Count:** Verify at least 2 links are present on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Count:** Verify at least 2 menu bars are present on the homepage.\n    *   **Data Strategy:** No specific test data is required for the smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** *This section is intentionally left blank as this document focuses solely on the Smoke Test strategy.* A separate Regression Test Strategy document will be created to cover more in-depth testing.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM) is recommended.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` object containing locators and methods for interacting with the UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential delays in element loading. This prevents false failures due to timing issues. Example: Wait up to 5 seconds for the \"Login\" button to be present before failing the test.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test execution. If a test fails due to a transient issue (e.g., network hiccup), retry the test a maximum of 2 times before marking it as a failure.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target. All smoke tests will be executed against the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the main SoundCloud logo.\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars must be present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n    *   **Clickability:** The buttons must be clickable (no action required after clicking).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed test cases, including screenshots and relevant logs.\n*   **Automation Priority:** Automate the smoke test suite as the highest priority. This will enable rapid feedback on build stability."
