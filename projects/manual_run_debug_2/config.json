Here's the Markdown report:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nSaucedemo.com is a demo e-commerce website. While not a real business, it simulates typical e-commerce functionality:\n*   **Critical Functionality (P0):** Login, Product Listing, Add to Cart, Checkout (Information, Overview, Finish).\n*   **Important Functionality (P1):** Product Details, Cart Management (Update/Remove), User Profile (if available).\n*   **Lower Priority (P2):** Sorting/Filtering, \"About\" page, minor UI elements.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure of Saucedemo.com, while not causing financial loss, can lead to:\n*   **Loss of Credibility:** For Sauce Labs as a demo platform.\n*   **Misleading Results:** Inaccurate representation of testing capabilities.\n*   **Wasted Time:** For users attempting to learn/demo testing.\n\nTherefore, maintaining the core functionality is crucial.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n*   All core e-commerce flows (Login, Product Listing, Add to Cart, Checkout).\n*   Positive and negative scenarios for all user inputs.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Basic security checks (input validation).\n*   Error handling and informative error messages.\n*   Accessibility (basic checks for ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n*   Detailed accessibility compliance (WCAG).\n*   Integration with external systems (payment gateways, shipping providers).  *Note: These are simulated in the demo.*\n*   Mobile app testing (if applicable, this strategy focuses on the web application).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build/deployment to ensure the system is fundamentally operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to the Saucedemo.com homepage.\n    2.  Login with `standard_user` and `secret_sauce`.\n    3.  Verify successful login (e.g., inventory page is displayed).\n    4.  Add one item to the cart.\n    5.  Navigate to the cart.\n    6.  Proceed to checkout.\n    7.  Enter valid checkout information.\n    8.  Complete the checkout process.\n    9.  Verify successful order completion.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After every build/deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass. Failure of any test case indicates a critical issue and should block further testing.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of all functionalities.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Login:** Invalid username, invalid password, empty fields, SQL injection attempts in username/password fields.\n    *   **Checkout:** Empty fields, invalid characters in name/address fields, missing information.\n    *   **Add to Cart:** Attempt to add zero or negative quantities (if applicable).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   **Concurrency:** Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n    *   **Network Failures:** Simulate network interruptions during checkout.\n    *   **Empty States:** Handling empty cart, no products available.\n    *   **Boundary Analysis:** Maximum quantity of items that can be added to the cart.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   **Input Validation:** Verify that all input fields are properly validated to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.  Specifically, check for proper encoding of special characters.\n    *   **Session Management:** Verify secure session handling and prevent session hijacking.\n*   **Alternative Flows:**\n    *   Verify functionality with different user roles (e.g., `locked_out_user`, `problem_user`, `performance_glitch_user`).\n    *   Verify the \"Remove\" button in the cart.\n    *   Verify the \"Continue Shopping\" button.\n*   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n    *   Verify that the cart count in the header is updated correctly when items are added or removed.\n    *   Verify that product details are displayed correctly.\n*   **Validation Messages:**\n    *   Verify that appropriate and user-friendly validation messages are displayed for all input fields.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** User credentials (`standard_user`, `secret_sauce`, etc.) will be stored in a configuration file.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Generate random names, addresses, and other information for checkout using a library like Faker.js (or equivalent in the chosen language).\n*   **Data Management:**  Test data should be isolated from production data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to improve code maintainability and reusability. Each page of the application should have a corresponding Page Object class that encapsulates the elements and actions on that page.\n*   **Language:**  [Choose language based on team expertise - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript]\n*   **Testing Framework:** [Choose testing framework based on language - e.g., JUnit, pytest, Mocha]\n*   **Assertion Library:** [Choose assertion library based on language - e.g., AssertJ, Chai, Hamcrest]\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met, rather than relying on fixed timeouts.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  Retry tests a limited number of times before marking them as failed.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI to identify elements based on multiple attributes) to reduce the impact of UI changes. *Note: This is an advanced technique and may not be necessary for a simple demo application.*\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to avoid unexpected behavior.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages/flows first:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify basic elements are present (logo, login form).\n2.  **Login Page:**  Focus on positive and negative login scenarios.\n3.  **Inventory Page:** Verify product listing, add to cart functionality.\n4.  **Cart Page:** Verify cart contents, remove functionality, checkout button.\n5.  **Checkout Pages (Information, Overview, Finish):**  Focus on data input and order completion.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all pages.\n    *   Expected elements are visible on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" text after login, product names on the inventory page).\n    *   Validation messages are displayed correctly for invalid inputs.\n    *   Order is successfully placed and a confirmation message is displayed.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).\n    *   Unexpected exceptions or errors.\n    *   Incorrect data displayed on pages.\n    *   Inability to complete core flows (login, checkout).\n    *   Security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust and reliable test automation suite for Saucedemo.com.  It should be reviewed and updated regularly as the application evolves.\n```\n"
