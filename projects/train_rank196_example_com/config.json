  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Website Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://example.com\n**Business Domain:** General Web Application\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the initial smoke testing phase of the website located at https://example.com. This strategy is designed to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational and stable before proceeding with more comprehensive testing. This document serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, including Senior QAs, Test Architects, and SDETs.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** This is a general web application. The primary risk is a non-functional website, leading to loss of potential users and damage to brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or critical elements to function results in immediate loss of user engagement and potential revenue.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and load time.\n        *   Existence and visibility of key UI elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action buttons), 2 additional buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Basic rendering of the website layout.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu items (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing beyond basic load time.\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Security testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the website loads successfully within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        2.  **Login Button:** Verify the \"Login\" button is visible and present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button:** Verify the \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar registration button is visible and present.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" or similar trial offer button is visible and present.\n        5.  **Button 4:** Verify the fourth button is visible and present on the page.\n        6.  **Button 5:** Verify the fifth button is visible and present on the page.\n        7.  **Link 1:** Verify the first link is visible and present on the page.\n        8.  **Link 2:** Verify the second link is visible and present on the page.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1:** Verify the first menu bar is visible and present on the page.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2:** Verify the second menu bar is visible and present on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for the initial smoke test. Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document after the smoke test is successful.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on UI element presence and website load.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for this initial smoke test. Consider using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure to represent the website's UI elements. This will facilitate maintainability as the test suite grows.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains methods to verify the presence of the Login, Signup, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:** Given the simplicity of the smoke test, flakiness should be minimal. However, implement basic retry mechanisms for website load failures.\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to verify the presence of UI elements, allowing for slight variations in load times.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: The primary target for this smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP 200 status code and successful rendering of the page layout.\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** Each specified button, link, and menu bar must be visible on the page.\n    *   **Success Definition:** All test cases in the smoke suite must pass. If any test case fails, the build is considered unstable and should be rejected."
