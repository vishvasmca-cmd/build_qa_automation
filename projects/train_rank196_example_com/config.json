  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Website Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://example.com\n**Business Domain:** General Web Application\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nThis is a general web application. The primary risk is website unavailability or critical functionality failure, leading to a negative user experience and potential loss of user engagement.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n*   **Impact of Failure:** Reduced user engagement, potential brand damage, loss of potential customers.\n*   **Critical Areas:** Website launch, navigation, key call-to-action elements (buttons, links, menus).\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Successful website launch and page load.\n    *   Presence and visibility of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar) buttons (at least 5).\n    *   Presence and visibility of at least 2 links.\n    *   Presence and visibility of at least 2 menu bars.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menus (no clicking).\n    *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n    *   Mobile testing (initially).\n    *   Detailed content verification.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **Element Visibility:** Verify the presence and visibility of at least 5 buttons (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, etc.).\n    3.  **Link Visibility:** Verify the presence and visibility of at least 2 links.\n    4.  **Menu Visibility:** Verify the presence and visibility of at least 2 menu bars.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n*N/A - This is a smoke test strategy.*\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n*   **Data Requirements:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Recommended for future test automation. Create page objects for the main website layout, header, and footer. This will allow for easy maintenance and updates as the website evolves.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for element to be visible) to handle potential timing issues during page load.\n*   **Element Existence Check:** Before asserting visibility, verify the element exists in the DOM to avoid false positives.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n*   **Primary Target:** The website's homepage (https://example.com).\n*   **Secondary Targets:** Any pages linked directly from the homepage that are likely to contain the target elements (e.g., a \"Pricing\" page if \"Try for Free\" is a button there).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n*   **Website Launch Success:** HTTP status code 200 (OK).\n*   **Element Visibility:**\n    *   Element is present in the DOM.\n    *   Element is visible on the page (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()` in Selenium).\n    *   Button/Link text is reasonably close to expected values (e.g., contains \"Login\", \"Sign Up\", \"Free\").\n*   **Menu Visibility:**\n    *   Menu element is present in the DOM.\n    *   Menu element is visible on the page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing the website smoke test. It focuses on verifying the core functionality and accessibility of the website, ensuring a positive initial user experience. This document will be updated as the application evolves and testing needs change."
