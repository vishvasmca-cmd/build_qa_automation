  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Gravatar.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nGravatar.com is a globally recognized avatar service. Its core function is to provide universally unique avatars for users across various platforms. While not directly revenue-generating in the traditional e-commerce sense, its availability and reliability are crucial for maintaining user experience and trust across numerous integrated services.\n\n*   **Business Criticality:** Medium. Outages don't directly impact revenue for Gravatar itself, but can disrupt user experience on platforms that rely on Gravatar images.\n*   **User Impact:** High. Widespread avatar unavailability can lead to a degraded user experience across the web.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of Gravatar.com can lead to:\n\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception of Gravatar and its parent company (Automattic).\n*   **User Dissatisfaction:** Frustration among users who rely on Gravatar avatars.\n*   **Service Disruption:** Impact on platforms that depend on Gravatar for user identification.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Website availability and basic functionality.\n*   Identification of key UI elements (buttons, links, menus).\n*   Successful loading of the homepage.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed functional testing of login, signup, or other user account features.\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n*   Mobile testing.\n*   API testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will focus on verifying the basic health of Gravatar.com. If any of these tests fail, the build should be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the Gravatar.com homepage loads successfully.\n    2.  **Button Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 5 of the following buttons: \"Login\", \"Signup/Get Started\", \"Try for Free\", or other prominent call-to-action buttons on the homepage.\n    3.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage (e.g., \"Learn More\", \"Terms of Service\").\n    4.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage (e.g., \"Products\", \"Support\").\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Not Applicable for Smoke Test)\n\nA regression suite will be developed later, focusing on deeper functional testing.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nFor the Smoke Suite, no specific test data is required. The tests primarily focus on UI element identification and page loading.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create Page Objects for the homepage and any other pages involved in the Smoke Suite. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for elements to load.\n*   **Element Existence Checks:** Before interacting with an element, verify that it exists on the page to prevent `NoSuchElementException` errors.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should focus on the following:\n\n*   **Homepage:** `https://gravatar.com`\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Homepage Load:**\n    *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n    *   Page Title: Contains \"Gravatar\" or a relevant keyword.\n*   **Button Identification:**\n    *   Element Presence: The specified buttons are present on the page.\n    *   Element Visibility: The buttons are visible to the user.\n*   **Link Identification:**\n    *   Element Presence: The specified links are present on the page.\n    *   Element Visibility: The links are visible to the user.\n*   **Menu Bar Identification:**\n    *   Element Presence: The specified menu bars are present on the page.\n    *   Element Visibility: The menu bars are visible to the user.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the Smoke Testing of Gravatar.com. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical aspects of the application to ensure its basic health and stability. This document will be updated as the testing effort evolves."
