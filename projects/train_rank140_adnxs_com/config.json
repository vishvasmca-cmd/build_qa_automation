  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: adnxs.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the adnxs.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** adnxs.com appears to be related to advertising technology (AdTech). While the specific business model requires deeper investigation, the core functionality likely involves managing ad campaigns, data analysis, and reporting. Failure in these areas can lead to financial losses for clients, inaccurate reporting, and reputational damage.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Given the potential financial impact on clients, the risk profile is considered **Medium-High**. System failures can directly impact revenue generation and client trust. Data breaches are also a significant concern in the AdTech space.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action buttons).\n        *   Presence of at least 5 buttons and 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons and links (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed exploration of menu options.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the adnxs.com website loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of Login, Signup/Get Started, and \"Try for Free\" (or similar) buttons on the homepage.\n        3.  **Button Count:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons on the homepage.\n        4.  **Link Count:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        5.  **Menu Bar Count:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for Smoke Testing)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For smoke tests, static data is sufficient. No dynamic data generation is required.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the adnxs.com homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   Create Page Objects for:\n        *   `HomePage`: Contains locators and methods for interacting with elements on the homepage (buttons, links, menus).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be present) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test steps that are prone to flakiness (e.g., website loading).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (adnxs.com):** Focus on identifying the required buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Element is present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n    *   **Button/Link/Menu Bar Count:** The number of elements found matches the expected count.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clearly report any failed smoke tests with detailed error messages and screenshots.\n    *   Prioritize fixing smoke test failures to ensure the system's core functionality is stable.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for smoke testing adnxs.com. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a robust and efficient testing process."
