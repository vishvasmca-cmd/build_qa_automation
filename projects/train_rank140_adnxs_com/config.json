  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Adnxs.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Adnxs.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Adnxs.com appears to be a platform related to advertising technology (AdTech). While the exact business model requires deeper investigation, the ability to access the website and identify key entry points (login, signup, etc.) is crucial for all users.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure to access the website or key functionalities represents a high risk. This could lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Inability for potential clients to explore the platform.\n    *   **Lost Business Opportunities:** Hindrance to new user acquisition.\n    *   **Internal Productivity Impact:** If internal users cannot access the platform.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website accessibility (HTTP 200 OK).\n        *   Identification of Login/Signup/Get Started buttons (or equivalent).\n        *   Identification of 5 buttons on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any buttons or links.\n        *   Form submission.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key entry points are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Accessibility:** Navigate to `https://adnxs.com` and verify HTTP status code 200.\n        2.  **Login Element Existence:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Existence:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" \"Try for Free,\" or equivalent button/link.\n        4.  **Button Count:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons on the homepage.\n        5.  **Link Count:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        6.  **Menu Bar Count:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing. Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element existence, not data input.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** While a full-fledged framework might be overkill for this *minimal* smoke test, consider using a lightweight framework or library for making HTTP requests and basic DOM element checks. Examples include:\n    *   **Python + Requests + Beautiful Soup:** Simple and effective for basic web scraping and assertion.\n    *   **JavaScript + Puppeteer/Playwright:** Allows for more realistic browser interaction if needed in the future.\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Not strictly necessary for this simple smoke test. However, if more extensive testing is planned, implementing a POM structure for the homepage would be beneficial.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**  Given the simplicity of the tests, flakiness should be minimal. However, implement a retry mechanism for the initial website accessibility check (e.g., retry 3 times with a 5-second delay).\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Not applicable for this smoke test.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** `https://adnxs.com`\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Accessibility:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    2.  **Login Element Existence:** Presence of a DOM element (button or link) containing the text \"Login\" (case-insensitive).\n    3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Existence:** Presence of a DOM element (button or link) containing the text \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" \"Try for Free,\" or similar (case-insensitive).\n    4.  **Button Count:** The number of `<button>` elements on the page is greater than or equal to 5.\n    5.  **Link Count:** The number of `<a>` (anchor) elements on the page is greater than or equal to 2.\n    6.  **Menu Bar Count:** Presence of at least two distinct `<div>` or `<nav>` elements that appear to represent menu bars (this may require visual inspection initially to confirm the correct elements are being identified).  Consider using CSS selectors that target common menu bar patterns (e.g., `div[role=\"menubar\"]`, `nav.main-menu`).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing Adnxs.com. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality of the website is verified effectively."
