# Test Plan for train_rank140_adnxs_com

## Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the train_rank140_adnxs_com project. The primary goal is to ensure the website functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. The plan includes smoke and regression test suites to cover critical functionalities and potential regression issues.

## Scope

The testing will cover the following areas:

*   Website navigation
*   Identification of key elements (buttons, links, menu bars)

## Test Suites

### Smoke Suite

The smoke suite will focus on verifying the core functionalities of the website. It will include tests to ensure the website loads correctly and key elements are present.

#### Smoke Suite Strategy

This project's smoke suite adheres to the following principles:

1.  **Critical Paths Only:** Focuses on the most essential user flows (e.g., website loading).
2.  **Positive Testing:** Primarily uses valid inputs and expected actions.
3.  **Minimal Data:** Uses a small, representative set of data.
4.  **Fast Execution:** Designed for quick execution to provide rapid feedback.
5.  **Independent Tests:** Each test is independent and can be run in any order.
6.  **Clear Assertions:** Assertions are straightforward and easy to understand.
7.  **Automated Execution:** Fully automated for continuous integration.
8.  **Build Validation:** Passing smoke tests are required for build acceptance.

### Regression Suite

The regression suite will cover a broader range of functionalities and scenarios to ensure that new changes do not introduce regressions. This will include tests for alternative flows, negative scenarios, and boundary conditions.

## Test Environment

*   Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
*   Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Linux

## Test Data

Test data will be created as needed to support the testing activities.
