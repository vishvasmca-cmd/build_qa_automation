  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: X.com Regression Testing\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for regression testing of the X.com website. It provides a framework for the entire engineering team to ensure comprehensive test coverage, maintain system stability, and mitigate potential risks.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** X.com (formerly Twitter) is a high-visibility social media platform. System failures can lead to significant reputational damage, user dissatisfaction, and potential financial losses. Data breaches are also a critical concern.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** A failure of core functionality (e.g., login, posting) has a high impact. Security vulnerabilities leading to data breaches pose the highest risk.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website functionality as described in the user goal, including core navigation, link validation, and element presence.\n        *   Negative testing of input fields and form submissions.\n        *   Basic security checks (OWASP Top 10 - input validation).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).\n        *   Performance testing (page load times for key pages).\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance - basic checks).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Mobile app testing.\n        *   API testing (unless directly related to front-end functionality defined in the user goal).\n        *   Advanced performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n        *   In-depth security penetration testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   Objective: Confirm basic website availability and core navigation.\n    *   Test Cases:\n        1.  Verify website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  Verify the presence of the Login button/link.\n        3.  Verify the presence of the Home page content.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Navigation and Element Presence:**\n        1.  Verify all identified links are present and navigate to the correct destinations (without clicking them).\n        2.  Verify all identified buttons (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, etc.) are present and visible.\n        3.  Verify the presence of the 2 menu bars without clicking on any options in them.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        1.  Attempt to log in with invalid credentials (incorrect username/password). Verify appropriate error messages.\n        2.  Attempt to sign up with invalid email format or weak password. Verify appropriate error messages.\n        3.  Submit forms with missing required fields. Verify appropriate error messages.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        1.  Test with extremely long inputs in relevant text fields.\n        2.  Test with special characters in relevant text fields.\n        3.  Simulate network interruptions during form submissions.\n        4.  Test with different browser window sizes (responsive design).\n    *   **Security:**\n        1.  Input validation: Attempt to inject SQL commands into login/signup fields.  Verify proper sanitization and no server errors.\n        2.  Input validation: Attempt to inject Javascript code into input fields (e.g., profile description). Verify proper sanitization and no XSS vulnerabilities.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   Utilize a combination of static and dynamically generated test data.\n        *   Static data:  Basic user credentials for known test accounts.\n        *   Dynamic data: Generate unique email addresses for signup testing, random strings for long input fields.\n        *   Consider using a test data management tool for larger, more complex datasets.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   Implement a Page Object Model (POM) architecture for test code.\n    *   Each page on X.com should have a corresponding Page Object class.\n    *   Elements on the page are represented as properties of the Page Object.\n    *   Actions on the page are represented as methods of the Page Object.\n    *   Recommended technologies:\n        *   Language: Java/Kotlin or Python (based on team expertise)\n        *   Test Framework: JUnit/TestNG (Java) or pytest (Python)\n        *   Browser Automation: Selenium WebDriver or Playwright\n        *   Assertion Library: AssertJ or Hamcrest (Java), pytest asserts (Python)\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous operations and potential delays in element loading.  Instead of immediately failing, the test will repeatedly check for the expected condition until a timeout is reached.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms using robust element locators (e.g., XPath with hierarchy or CSS selectors with stable attributes).  If an element is not found with the primary locator, attempt to locate it using alternative locators.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  If a test fails, it will be retried a specified number of times before being marked as a failure.\n    *   **Environment Variables:** Store environment-specific configurations (URLs, credentials) in environment variables.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   Prioritize exploration of the following pages/flows:\n        1.  Homepage (https://x.com)\n        2.  Login page (https://x.com/login)\n        3.  Signup/Get Started page (https://x.com/signup)\n        4.  Any \"Try for Free\" pages if available.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 OK status code for all page requests.\n        *   Expected elements are present and visible on the page.\n        *   Navigation to the correct page after clicking links/buttons.\n        *   Correct error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   HTTP error codes (4xx, 5xx).\n        *   Missing or incorrectly rendered elements.\n        *   Incorrect navigation.\n        *   Unexpected error messages or server errors.\n        *   Security vulnerabilities identified through input validation testing.\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   Run the smoke suite after each build to ensure basic system health.\n    *   Run the full regression suite after each code change or on a scheduled basis (e.g., nightly).\n    *   Analyze test results and report failures to the development team.\n    *   Track test coverage and identify areas for improvement.\n    *   Regularly update the test suite to reflect changes in the application."
