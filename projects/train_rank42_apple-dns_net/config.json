  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: apple-dns.net (Smoke Testing)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the apple-dns.net website. It serves as the blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** apple-dns.net appears to be a general web application, potentially offering DNS services or information related to Apple's DNS infrastructure. The business criticality is moderate, as website unavailability impacts user access to information and potential service sign-ups.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website can lead to:\n    *   Loss of potential customers due to inability to access information or sign up.\n    *   Damage to brand reputation due to website unavailability.\n    *   Loss of trust if critical information is inaccessible.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page loading.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the identified elements (e.g., clicking buttons, submitting forms).\n        *   Detailed testing of specific DNS services or features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS verification).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present on the page.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button is present on the page.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify a fourth button is present on the page.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify a fifth button is present on the page.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a first link is present on the page.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify a second link is present on the page.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a first menu bar is present on the page.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify a second menu bar is present on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing. Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the website's pages and elements. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java` (or .py, .js, etc.) - Contains locators and methods for the home page elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading. This will reduce flakiness.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Optional):** Consider implementing a basic self-healing mechanism to automatically retry element location if it fails initially.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage (`/`):** The primary focus is the homepage of the website.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify the HTTP status code is 200 OK for the homepage.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Verify that all specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page using appropriate locators (e.g., XPath, CSS selectors).\n    *   **No Exceptions:** The test should not throw any exceptions during execution.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate a clear and concise test report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots or videos of failed tests to aid in debugging.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the apple-dns.net website. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the website is accessible and core elements are present, minimizing the risk of critical failures."
