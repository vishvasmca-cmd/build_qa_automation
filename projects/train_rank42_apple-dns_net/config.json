  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: apple-dns.net (Smoke Testing)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the apple-dns.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The website appears to be a general web application, potentially offering DNS services. Business criticality is moderate; failure to load the website or access core functionalities impacts user experience and potentially service adoption.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or critical elements to function can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Potential Customers:** Users unable to access the site may seek alternative solutions.\n    *   **Damage to Reputation:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the brand.\n    *   **Reduced Service Adoption:** If signup or trial functionalities are broken, user conversion is hampered.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification and presence of key UI elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar), and 2 other buttons.\n        *   Identification and presence of 2 links.\n        *   Identification and presence of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the website homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button (or similar) is present.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button (or similar) is present.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify the presence of another button.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify the presence of another button.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify the presence of a link.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify the presence of a link.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify the presence of a menu bar.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify the presence of a menu bar.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing. This document focuses solely on the initial smoke test strategy.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   Implement a lightweight framework. For smoke tests, a full Page Object Model might be overkill. Consider a simpler approach that focuses on element identification and assertion.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., waiting for an element to be present for a short duration) to handle potential timing issues during page load.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial website load test in case of temporary network glitches.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: The primary target for all smoke tests.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP 200 status code AND page title is present (e.g., \"apple-dns.net\" or similar).\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** Elements are present in the DOM (Document Object Model). Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify the elements.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear \"Pass/Fail\" status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failures, including screenshots if possible.\n    *   Report execution time.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the apple-dns.net website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure a stable and reliable user experience."
