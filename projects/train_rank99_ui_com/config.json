  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ui.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the smoke testing of ui.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** ui.com appears to be a general web application, potentially related to networking or technology products (based on the \"ui\" in the URL). The business criticality depends on the specific services offered. Failure could lead to loss of potential customers, damage to brand reputation, and potential revenue loss if it's an e-commerce platform.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A failure of core functionalities (website launch, navigation, user onboarding) can lead to immediate loss of potential customers and damage to brand perception.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading of the homepage.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action) - 5 buttons in total.\n        *   Presence of 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the buttons and links (clicking, navigation).\n        *   Detailed content verification beyond the presence of the specified elements.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the website is up and running, and key elements for user onboarding are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website (https://ui.com) loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button (or similar) is present on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify the 4th button is present on the homepage.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify the 5th button is present on the homepage.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify the 1st link is present on the homepage.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify the 2nd link is present on the homepage.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify the 1st menu bar is present on the homepage.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify the 2nd menu bar is present on the homepage.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** *Not applicable for Smoke Test.* This will be defined in a separate Regression Test Strategy document.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For this smoke test, no specific test data is required. The focus is on the presence of elements, not their functionality.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class representing the ui.com homepage.\n        *   Within the `HomePage` class, define elements (buttons, links, menu bars) as properties.\n        *   Create methods to interact with these elements (e.g., `isLoginButtonPresent()`, `isSignupButtonPresent()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential loading delays.  Instead of immediately failing if an element is not found, retry for a short period (e.g., 5 seconds) before failing.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for the homepage.\n        *   The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the homepage.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   HTTP error codes (4xx, 5xx).\n        *   Any of the specified buttons, links, or menu bars are missing or not visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the smoke testing of ui.com. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the delivery of a stable and reliable application."
