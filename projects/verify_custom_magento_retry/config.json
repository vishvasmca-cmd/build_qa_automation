  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Magento e-commerce application (Target URL: https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe application is an e-commerce platform built on Magento. Key business areas include:\n\n*   **Product Discovery:** Browsing, searching, and filtering products.\n*   **Product Details:** Viewing product information, reviews, and availability.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and modifying items.\n*   **Checkout:** Entering shipping information, selecting payment methods, and placing orders.\n*   **User Account Management:** Registration, login, profile management, and order history.\n\n**Business Criticality (P0):** Checkout process, Payment processing, User Login/Registration.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the Magento application can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Lost sales due to checkout errors, payment processing failures, or inventory inaccuracies.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised customer data (e.g., credit card information, personal details) due to security vulnerabilities.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust due to application instability, security breaches, or poor user experience.\n*   **Operational Disruption:** Inability to process orders, manage inventory, or fulfill customer requests.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All core e-commerce functionalities (product browsing, search, add to cart, checkout, payment processing, user account management).\n*   Integration with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, shipping providers).\n*   Performance and scalability under expected load.\n*   Security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).\n*   Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.\n*   Accessibility (WCAG guidelines).\n*   API testing for all critical services.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Third-party plugins and extensions (unless explicitly identified as critical).\n*   Detailed performance testing beyond basic load testing.\n*   Detailed accessibility testing beyond basic WCAG compliance.\n*   Detailed localization testing beyond basic language support.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure the application's core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Login:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n*   **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads without errors.\n*   **Product Search:** Verify successful product search using a known keyword.\n*   **Add to Cart:** Verify a product can be added to the cart.\n*   **Checkout Start:** Verify the checkout process can be initiated.\n\n**Goal:** Rapidly identify critical issues that prevent basic application functionality.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will be executed periodically (e.g., nightly, weekly) to ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid Login attempts (incorrect username/password).\n    *   Invalid input during checkout (e.g., missing required fields, invalid credit card number).\n    *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart.\n    *   Submitting forms with XSS payloads.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures during checkout (simulated latency, dropped connections).\n    *   Empty states: Empty cart, no search results.\n    *   Large number of items in the cart.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   OWASP Top 10 basics: Input validation to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).\n    *   Authentication and authorization testing.\n    *   Session management testing.\n*   **Alternative Flows:**\n    *   Checkout with different payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal).\n    *   Checkout with different shipping addresses.\n    *   Applying coupons and discounts.\n*   **Boundary Analysis:**\n    *   Minimum and maximum quantities for product purchases.\n    *   Maximum allowed characters for input fields.\n*   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n    *   Cart updates reflected in the header (item count, subtotal).\n    *   Order history accurately reflects placed orders.\n*   **Validation Messages:**\n    *   Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input.\n    *   Verify that success messages are displayed after successful actions.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined user accounts, product catalogs, and payment methods for basic testing.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generated data for negative testing, edge cases, and large-scale testing (e.g., randomly generated email addresses, credit card numbers, order quantities).\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be managed in a centralized repository (e.g., database, CSV files) to ensure consistency and reusability.\n*   **Data Masking:** Sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, personal information) will be masked or anonymized in test environments to protect customer privacy.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to encapsulate page elements and interactions. This will improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication.\n*   **Language:** Python or Java are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n*   **Test Runner:** Pytest (Python) or JUnit (Java) for test execution and reporting.\n*   **Assertion Library:** Pytest-Assert or AssertJ for fluent assertions.\n*   **Reporting:** Allure or ExtentReports for generating detailed and visually appealing test reports.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures (e.g., element not found, network timeout). This can involve retrying actions, refreshing the page, or using alternative locators.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test. This will prevent tests from failing due to timing issues.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. This will allow tests to be retried a certain number of times before being marked as failed.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify layout, navigation, and promotional content.\n2.  **Product Listing Pages (Category Pages):** Verify product filtering, sorting, and pagination.\n3.  **Product Detail Pages:** Verify product information, images, reviews, and add-to-cart functionality.\n4.  **Shopping Cart:** Verify item quantities, subtotal, and checkout button.\n5.  **Checkout Page:** Verify shipping address form, payment method selection, and order confirmation.\n6.  **Login/Registration Pages:** Verify user authentication and account creation.\n7.  **Search Results Page:** Verify search functionality and result accuracy.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all requests return a 200 OK status code.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Verify that all critical elements are visible and interactable.\n*   **Text Verification:** Verify that expected text is present on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product name on the product detail page).\n*   **Form Submission:** Verify that forms can be submitted successfully and that appropriate success messages are displayed.\n*   **Database Validation:** Verify that data is correctly stored in the database (e.g., order details, user information).\n*   **API Response Validation:** Verify that API responses are valid and contain the expected data.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.\n"
