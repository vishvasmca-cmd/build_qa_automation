  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com E-Commerce Platform\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n*   **Domain:** E-commerce\n*   **Business Criticality:** High. The platform facilitates online sales, making functionality related to product browsing, cart management, checkout, and payment processing critical.\n*   **User Journey Focus:** The provided user goal outlines a comprehensive end-to-end flow covering key aspects of the site.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n*   **High Risk Areas:** Checkout & Payments, Account Management (Registration, Login, Deletion). Failures in these areas directly impact revenue and user trust.\n*   **Medium Risk Areas:** Product Catalog, Shopping Cart. Issues here affect the user experience and potentially lead to lost sales.\n*   **Potential Risks:**\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Payment processing errors, incorrect pricing, failed order placement.\n    *   **Data Breach:** Security vulnerabilities in account management, exposing user data.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Poor user experience due to bugs, resulting in negative reviews and loss of customer loyalty.\n    *   **Functional Defects:** Broken features, incorrect data display, and unexpected behavior.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   All functionalities covered in the specified user goal.\n    *   Core e-commerce features: Product browsing, searching, filtering, adding to cart, checkout process (including payment), user registration/login, account management, order management.\n    *   UI/UX elements directly related to the core functionalities.\n    *   Responsive design across different screen sizes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile - high-level, separate project can be done for thorough coverage).\n    *   Basic security checks (e.g., input validation, no exposed sensitive data).\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Performance testing (load, stress, etc.) - separate project\n    *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning) - separate project\n    *   Detailed cross-browser compatibility testing (beyond basic checks on Chrome, Firefox, Safari) - separate project\n    *   Accessibility testing - separate project\n    *   A/B testing or experimentation features.\n    *   Thorough coverage of 3rd party integrations.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Overall Approach\n\nWe will adopt a risk-based testing approach, prioritizing testing efforts on the most critical areas.  The automation strategy will focus on achieving high test coverage for regression scenarios, while maintaining a smaller, stable smoke suite for rapid build verification.\n\n### 2.2 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core functionality of the application after each build or deployment.  A 'Go/No-Go' decision point.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After every build/deployment.\n*   **Smoke Candidates (MINIMAL):**\n    *   Navigate to the homepage and verify page load.\n    *   User Login (Valid credentials).\n    *   View Product Details page.\n    *   Add Item to Cart.\n    *   Complete Purchase (Guest user, happy path with a pre-configured test credit card).\n*   **Data Strategy (Smoke):** Use static, pre-defined test data for smoke tests. This ensures consistency and stability.\n\n### 2.3 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Purpose:** To ensure that new changes have not introduced any regressions or broken existing functionality.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** Scheduled nightly runs, triggered by code commits, or before major releases.\n*   **Regression Candidates (BASED ON USER GOAL - EXPAND SCOPE):**\n    *   **Authentication:**\n        *   Login with Invalid Password\n        *   Registration with Existing Email\n        *   Password Reset Flow\n    *   **Product Catalog:**\n        *   Search for non-existent product.\n        *   Filter products by Price/Category.\n        *   Verify Pagination.\n    *   **Shopping Cart:**\n        *   Update Quantity in Cart.\n        *   Remove Item from Cart.\n        *   Add Out-of-Stock Item (Verify Error).\n        *   Cart Persistence (Refresh Page).\n    *   **Checkout & Payments:**\n        *   Checkout with formatted Address\n        *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code\n        *   Payment Decline Simulation\n        *   Verify Address & Order\n        *   Calculate Tax/Shipping correctly\n    *   **Account Management:**\n        *   Account Creation with various input validations.\n        *   Delete Account (Success).\n        *   Download Invoice (Verify file download).\n*   **Data Strategy (Regression):**\n    *   **Dynamic Generation:** Use a combination of dynamic test data generation and static data sets. This allows for more comprehensive testing with varied inputs.\n    *   **Data Pools:** Consider using data pools for scenarios requiring specific data sets (e.g., valid/invalid coupon codes).\n    *   **Data Cleanup:** Implement data cleanup mechanisms to prevent test data from polluting the environment.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This promotes maintainability, reusability, and readability.\n    *   Each page or component of the application should have a corresponding Page Object.\n    *   Page Objects should encapsulate the elements and methods specific to that page.\n    *   Test cases should interact with the application through the Page Objects, not directly with the UI elements.\n*   **Language:** (Assuming Java, but can be adjusted) Java with Selenium WebDriver.\n*   **Test Runner:** TestNG or JUnit.\n*   **Reporting:** Extent Reports, Allure Reports, or similar.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n*   **Flakiness Handling:** Flaky tests are a major impediment to automation success. Implement strategies to mitigate flakiness.\n    *   **Polling Assertions (Retry Logic):** Use `WebDriverWait` with explicit waits to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content.  Implement retry mechanisms for assertions that may intermittently fail.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically locate elements, even if their locators change slightly (e.g., using relative locators or AI-powered locator strategies).  This should be used cautiously and with thorough verification.\n    *   **Test Prioritization:** Tag tests based on their stability.  Flaky tests should be executed less frequently or excluded from critical pipelines until fixed.\n*   **Robust Locators:** Prioritize stable locators (e.g., IDs, data attributes) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on text or position).\n*   **Environment Management:** Ensure consistent test environments to minimize environment-related failures.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Prioritized Order)\nBased on the user goal and risk assessment, the autonomous agent should focus on the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Checkout Flow:**  From adding an item to cart to placing an order and payment confirmation. This is the most critical flow.\n2.  **Registration/Login Flow:** Cover all variations and edge cases related to user account management.\n3.  **Product Details Page:** Ensure the page loads correctly, displays accurate information, and allows users to add items to the cart.\n4.  **Shopping Cart Page:** Verify the cart updates correctly, allows users to modify quantities, and remove items.\n5.  **Homepage / Product Listing Page:** Ensure the page loads correctly and that products are displayed.\n6.  **Account Management Pages:** Invoice downloads, order history, updating profile information.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria (Examples)\n*   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that all requests return a 200 OK status code (or other expected status codes).\n*   **Text Verification:**\n    *   \"Welcome\" text displayed after login.\n    *   Order confirmation message displayed after successful order placement.\n    *   Error messages displayed for invalid inputs (e.g., \"Invalid email address\").\n*   **Element Presence:** Verify that specific elements are present on the page (e.g., product image, price, \"Add to Cart\" button).\n*   **Data Integrity:** Verify that data is displayed correctly (e.g., order total matches the sum of the items in the cart).\n*   **File Download:** Verify that the invoice is downloaded successfully.\n*   **Database Verification:** (Optional, but highly recommended) Verify that data is correctly stored in the database after performing actions (e.g., user registration, order placement).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the AutomationExercise.com e-commerce platform.  It outlines the key areas of focus, the testing approach, and the architectural considerations for building a robust and maintainable test automation framework. This document will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changing requirements and priorities."
