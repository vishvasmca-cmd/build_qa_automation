  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Amazon.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a smoke test of Amazon.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a focused and efficient approach to verifying the core functionality of the website.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Amazon.com is a high-traffic e-commerce platform. System failures can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and customer dissatisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. Failure of core functionalities (e.g., website availability, login) directly impacts revenue and user trust.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially, focus on desktop).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Amazon.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present on the homepage.\n        4.  **\"Try for Free\" Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button is present on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Generic):** Verify the presence of 2 other buttons on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of 2 links on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for a smoke test. Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on UI element presence.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Amazon.com homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains locators and methods for interacting with elements on the homepage (e.g., `getLoginButton()`, `getSignupButton()`, `getLink1()`, `getMenuBar1()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available. Example: `new WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.id(\"loginButton\")));`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test execution in case of transient network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Amazon.com Homepage:** The primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code AND the page title contains \"Amazon\".\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars) are present on the page (i.e., `element.isDisplayed()` returns `true`).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed test cases, including screenshots and relevant logs."
