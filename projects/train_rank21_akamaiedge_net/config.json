  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Akamai Edge Website - Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Akamai Edge provides edge security, content delivery network (CDN), and cloud service solutions. Website availability and core functionality are crucial for maintaining brand reputation, customer trust, and lead generation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure to load the website or critical elements like login/signup can lead to immediate loss of potential customers, damage to brand reputation, and hinder business operations. This is a high-risk scenario.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website homepage load.\n        *   Identification of Login, Signup/GetStarted, and three other prominent buttons.\n        *   Identification of two prominent links on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of two menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Navigation to other pages beyond the homepage.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health and accessibility of the Akamai Edge website.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Load:** Verify the Akamai Edge homepage loads successfully.\n    2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n        *   Login button/link.\n        *   Signup/GetStarted button/link.\n        *   Three other prominent buttons (e.g., \"Contact Us,\" \"Learn More,\" \"Request a Demo\").\n        *   Two prominent links (e.g., \"Terms of Service,\" \"Privacy Policy\").\n        *   Two menu bars (e.g., primary navigation, footer navigation).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test as it focuses on element presence and website load.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   Implement a basic Page Object Model (POM) structure.  A single `HomePage` object will suffice for this smoke test. This will allow for future expansion of the test suite.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible()`) to handle potential loading delays, especially for elements that might load asynchronously.  Set a reasonable timeout (e.g., 5-10 seconds).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial website load in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** Akamai Edge homepage (`https://akamaiedge.net`).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200 (OK).\n        *   Presence of the `<html>` tag.\n        *   Presence of the `<body>` tag.\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   Verify that each required element (Login, Signup, 3 buttons, 2 links, 2 menus) is present on the page using appropriate selectors (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath).\n        *   Verify that the elements are visible (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()`).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clearly report any failures, including the specific element that could not be found or the HTTP status code if the website failed to load.\n    *   Include screenshots of the page in case of failures."
