# Test Plan for train_rank59_skype_com

## Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the train_rank59_skype_com project, focusing on testing key functionalities of the Skype website (skype.com). The plan includes both smoke and regression test suites to ensure the quality and stability of the application.

## Test Scope

The testing will cover the following areas:

*   **Smoke Tests:** Verify the core functionalities of the website, including identifying key elements like buttons and links.
*   **Regression Tests:** Ensure that new changes haven't introduced defects in existing functionalities.

## Test Strategy

We will employ a risk-based testing approach, prioritizing tests based on the criticality and impact of the functionalities. The test suites will be automated using a BDD framework (Cucumber) to ensure efficient and repeatable testing.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite will focus on the most critical functionalities of the application. The following checklist will be applied when designing the smoke tests:

1.  **Critical Path Coverage:** Tests cover the most common user flows.
2.  **Core Functionality:** Focus on essential features required for the application to function.
3.  **Positive Testing:** Primarily positive test cases, verifying expected behavior.
4.  **Minimal Data Variation:** Use a limited set of test data to keep the suite concise.
5.  **Fast Execution:** Tests should execute quickly to provide rapid feedback.
6.  **Independent Tests:** Tests should be independent of each other to avoid cascading failures.
7.  **Automated Execution:** Tests should be automated for continuous integration.
8.  **Build Acceptance:** Passing smoke tests are a prerequisite for build acceptance.

## Test Environment

The tests will be executed in the following environment:

*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)
*   **Operating System:** Windows 10
*   **Test Framework:** Cucumber
