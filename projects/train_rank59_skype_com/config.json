  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Skype Website - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Skype website (https://skype.com). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Skype is a communication platform. Failure can lead to user frustration, communication breakdowns, and potential loss of business/personal opportunities.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Medium. Website unavailability impacts user access and brand reputation.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons and links (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the Skype website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Skype homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Generic x5):** Verify 5 other buttons are present and visible.\n        6.  **Link Presence (Generic x2):** Verify 2 links are present and visible.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (Generic x2):** Verify 2 menu bars are present and visible.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No test data required for smoke tests as we are only verifying the presence of elements.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Skype homepage. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n        *   `SkypeHomePage`: Page object representing the Skype homepage. Contains methods to verify the presence of key elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with reasonable timeouts to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by slow network connections. Example: Wait up to 5 seconds for the \"Login\" button to be visible.\n    *   **Element Existence Checks:** Before interacting with an element, verify that it exists in the DOM. This prevents `NoSuchElementException` errors.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Skype Homepage (https://skype.com):** This is the primary target for smoke testing.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and page title contains \"Skype\".\n    *   **Element Presence:** Element is visible on the page (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()` returns true).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed test cases.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the Skype website. It will be reviewed and updated as needed to ensure its continued effectiveness."
