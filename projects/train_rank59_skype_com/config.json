  "master_plan": "# Skype.com - Master Test Strategy (Smoke Testing)\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Skype.com is a communication platform. Failure impacts user communication, potentially leading to missed opportunities, business disruptions, and user frustration.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. System unavailability directly impacts communication capabilities. Data breaches or security vulnerabilities could lead to significant reputational damage and legal ramifications.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars) on the homepage.\n        *   Verification of element text and basic attributes (e.g., href for links).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicks).\n        *   Login/Signup workflows (covered in separate regression tests).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially focus on desktop).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   API testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Skype.com homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n        *   5 specified buttons (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, and any other 2 prominent buttons).\n        *   2 specified links.\n        *   2 specified menu bars.\n    3.  **Element Attributes:** Verify the text of the buttons and the `href` attribute of the links.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   This smoke test is designed to be a rapid health check. Full regression testing will cover the functionality of each element, error handling, and edge cases.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   Static data. No dynamic data generation is required for smoke tests. The focus is on UI element presence and basic attributes.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM). Even for a simple smoke test, POM provides a structured approach for maintainability and scalability. Create a `HomePage` object containing locators and methods for accessing the target elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible`) to handle potential timing issues during page load.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for element location, in case of intermittent loading issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage (https://skype.com):** Focus all exploration on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Elements are present in the DOM and visible on the page.\n    *   **Element Attributes:**\n        *   Button text matches expected values.\n        *   Link `href` attributes are present and contain valid URLs (basic validation, not full URL resolution).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failures, including element locators and expected vs. actual values.\n    *   Screenshots on failure to aid in debugging."
