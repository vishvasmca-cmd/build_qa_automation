  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. I need to create a Master Test Strategy document for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing and the specific user goal of logging in with the `standard_user` and `secret_sauce` credentials. This document will guide the entire engineering team.\n\nHere's the Master Test Strategy:\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** General E-commerce (Simulated)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n**Target User Goal:** Login with `standard_user` and `secret_sauce`\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo.com, while a demo application, simulates a basic e-commerce platform. The core functionality revolves around user authentication, product browsing, adding items to a cart, and checkout.  While not a real-world e-commerce site, failures can still lead to:\n\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect product information or order details.\n*   **Functional Defects:** Inability to add items to cart, complete checkout, or manage user accounts.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Exposure of user credentials or payment information (simulated).\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Even for a demo site, a buggy experience reflects poorly on the underlying technology.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nThe risk profile is moderate. While financial loss isn't a direct concern, a poorly functioning application can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Trust:** Users may distrust the underlying technology or development practices.\n*   **Inefficient Testing:** Bugs discovered late in the cycle are more costly to fix.\n*   **Delayed Releases:** Critical defects can block deployments.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** Login, Logout, Password Reset (if implemented).\n*   **Product Catalog:** Browsing, Filtering, Sorting, Product Details.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, Removing, Modifying Items.\n*   **Checkout Process:** Shipping Information, Payment Information (simulated), Order Confirmation.\n*   **User Account Management:** Profile updates (if implemented).\n*   **Error Handling:** Validation messages, exception handling.\n*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Testing on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   **Responsiveness:** Testing on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n*   **Accessibility:** Basic accessibility checks (e.g., alt text for images).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing, endurance testing.\n*   **Penetration Testing:** In-depth security vulnerability assessment.\n*   **A/B Testing:** Experimenting with different UI variations.\n*   **Integration with External Systems:** (Since it's a demo, there are likely no real integrations).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Login:**\n    *   Verify successful login with `standard_user` and `secret_sauce`.\n    *   Verify successful logout.\n*   **Product Page Load:**\n    *   Verify the product catalog page loads successfully.\n    *   Verify at least one product is displayed.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will be executed to ensure that new changes haven't broken existing functionality.\n\n*   **Authentication:**\n    *   **Positive:** Login with valid credentials for all user roles (if applicable).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Invalid username.\n        *   Invalid password.\n        *   Locked out user (if applicable).\n        *   Empty username and password fields.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Very long username/password strings.\n        *   Special characters in username/password.\n*   **Product Catalog:**\n    *   **Positive:**\n        *   Browse products by category (if applicable).\n        *   Filter products by price, name, etc. (if applicable).\n        *   Sort products by price, name, etc. (if applicable).\n        *   View product details.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Attempt to filter with invalid criteria.\n        *   Attempt to sort with invalid criteria.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Products with very long names/descriptions.\n        *   Products with special characters in names/descriptions.\n*   **Shopping Cart:**\n    *   **Positive:**\n        *   Add items to the cart.\n        *   Remove items from the cart.\n        *   Update item quantities.\n        *   View cart total.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Attempt to add zero or negative quantities.\n        *   Attempt to add more items than available in stock.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Adding a large number of items to the cart.\n        *   Adding items with special characters in their names/descriptions.\n*   **Checkout Process:**\n    *   **Positive:**\n        *   Complete the checkout process with valid shipping and payment information (simulated).\n        *   Verify order confirmation page.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Invalid shipping information (e.g., missing fields, invalid zip code).\n        *   Invalid payment information (e.g., invalid credit card number).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Shipping to a very long address.\n        *   Using special characters in shipping address fields.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   **Input Validation:** Check for basic SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities in all input fields (username, password, address, etc.).  Attempt to inject malicious code and verify it's properly sanitized.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Verify that error messages do not expose sensitive information.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** Use predefined usernames and passwords (e.g., `standard_user`, `secret_sauce`).\n*   **Dynamic Data:** For fields like address and payment information, generate random data using libraries like Faker.js or similar. This helps avoid data collisions and ensures test data is realistic.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nImplement a Page Object Model (POM) structure. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n\n*   **Page Objects:** Create separate classes for each page (e.g., LoginPage, ProductsPage, CartPage, CheckoutPage). Each class should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n*   **Test Cases:** Test cases should interact with the application through the Page Objects.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitForElementVisible`, `waitUntil`) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms. For example, if an element is not found, attempt to refresh the page or navigate back to the previous page.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to avoid unexpected behavior.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages/flows first:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Focus on all input fields and the login button.\n2.  **Products Page:** (After successful login) - Focus on product listings, filtering/sorting options (if available), and product detail links.\n3.  **Cart Page:** Focus on adding/removing items, updating quantities, and the checkout button.\n4.  **Checkout Page:** Focus on all input fields for shipping and payment information (simulated).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all requests return a 200 OK status code.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Verify that key elements are visible on each page (e.g., product names, prices, cart total, checkout button).\n*   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text is present on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\", \"Your Cart\", \"Checkout\").\n*   **Error Messages:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n*   **Functional Verification:** Verify that core functionality is working as expected (e.g., adding items to the cart, completing the checkout process).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing Saucedemo.com. It should be used as a guide for all testing activities, from test planning to test execution. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as needed based on the evolving needs of the application.\n"
