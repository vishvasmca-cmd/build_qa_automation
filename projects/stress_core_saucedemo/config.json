  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo E-Commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Saucedemo e-commerce application. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring the delivery of a high-quality, reliable product.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo is an e-commerce application.  In this domain, the **Checkout process is of paramount importance (P0)**.  Any failure in this area directly impacts revenue generation and customer satisfaction.  Authentication and Product Catalog are also critical, but slightly less so than Checkout.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the Saucedemo application can result in the following risks:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders leads to direct revenue loss.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Poor user experience due to bugs can damage the brand's reputation and customer trust.\n*   **Data Security Breach:** Vulnerabilities in security can lead to sensitive customer data being compromised.\n*   **Operational Disruption:** Critical system failures can halt business operations.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user authentication, product catalog browsing, shopping cart management, and checkout/payment processing.\n*   Functional testing, regression testing, security testing (OWASP Top 10 basics), performance testing (load testing of key flows).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Mobile responsiveness testing (simulated mobile devices).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed performance testing (beyond load testing key flows).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Localization testing (if applicable).\n*   Integration with external services (beyond basic API validation).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.  Failure of any of these tests will result in build rejection.\n\n*   **Authentication:**\n    *   Successful User Login (using `standard_user`)\n*   **Product Catalog:**\n    *   Homepage Load and Product Display\n*   **Shopping Cart:**\n    *   Add Item to Cart\n*   **Checkout & Payments:**\n    *   Complete Purchase (Guest / Standard)\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Authentication:** Invalid login attempts, password reset failures, registration with existing email.\n    *   **Product Catalog:** Searching for non-existent products, filtering with invalid criteria.\n    *   **Shopping Cart:** Adding out-of-stock items, updating quantity with invalid values.\n    *   **Checkout & Payments:** Applying invalid coupon codes, entering incorrect payment information, invalid address formats.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   **Concurrency:** Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n    *   **Network Failures:** Simulating network interruptions during checkout.\n    *   **Empty States:** Handling empty cart, empty search results.\n    *   **Boundary Values:** Testing minimum and maximum quantities, price ranges.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on all input fields (login, search, address, payment details).\n    *   Session management and authentication token security.\n*   **User Goal:**\n    *   Login with `standard_user`, sort products by price (low to high), add the lowest-cost item to the cart, and complete the checkout process successfully.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  A set of pre-defined user accounts (including `standard_user`), product information, and coupon codes will be maintained.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Randomly generated data (e.g., email addresses, order numbers) will be used to avoid conflicts and ensure test data uniqueness.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a centralized repository (e.g., CSV files, database) and managed using a data management tool.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to improve code maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should be represented as a separate Page Object, encapsulating the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:**  Implement explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically recover from common test failures, such as element not found errors.  This could involve retrying actions or re-locating elements.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for tests that are prone to flakiness due to network issues or server instability.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  `https://www.saucedemo.com/`\n2.  **Product Inventory Page:** (After successful login)\n3.  **Product Details Page:** (Clicking on a product)\n4.  **Shopping Cart Page:**\n5.  **Checkout Pages:** (Information, Overview, Completion)\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant page titles and headings are visible (e.g., \"Products\" after login, \"Checkout: Your Information\" on the checkout page).\n    *   Expected elements are present and interactable (e.g., login button, add to cart button, checkout button).\n    *   Data is displayed correctly (e.g., product names, prices, quantities).\n    *   Successful completion of the user goal: Login, sort, add to cart, and complete checkout.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Incorrect data or missing elements.\n    *   Inability to complete the user goal.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the Saucedemo application.\n"
