  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo E-Commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Saucedemo e-commerce application (Target URL: https://www.saucedemo.com/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring high-quality releases.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo is an e-commerce platform, making the following areas critical to business success:\n\n*   **Checkout & Payments:**  A failure here directly impacts revenue. (P0)\n*   **Authentication:**  Essential for user access and order management. (P0)\n*   **Product Catalog:**  Customers must be able to find and view products. (P1)\n*   **Shopping Cart:**  A functional cart is crucial for order completion. (P1)\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nSystem failures in Saucedemo can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:**  Failed transactions, lost orders, revenue impact.\n*   **Reputational Damage:**  Negative customer reviews, loss of trust.\n*   **Data Security Breaches:**  Compromised user data (if applicable).\n*   **Operational Inefficiency:**  Increased support costs, manual workarounds.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to Authentication, Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, and Checkout & Payments.\n*   UI/UX testing across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   API testing for core functionalities (if APIs are exposed).\n*   Security testing for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).\n*   Performance testing (load and stress) for critical paths (Checkout).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG guidelines).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Third-party integrations (unless explicitly stated and critical).\n*   Detailed performance testing of non-critical pages.\n*   Localization testing (unless specifically requested).\n*   Mobile app testing (if separate from the web application).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite provides a rapid health check of the application.  If any of these tests fail, the build is rejected.\n\n*   **Authentication:**\n    *   Successful User Login (using `standard_user`)\n*   **Product Catalog:**\n    *   Homepage Loads Successfully (Verify product listing)\n*   **Shopping Cart:**\n    *   Add Item to Cart (Verify item count increases)\n*   **Checkout & Payments:**\n    *   Initiate Checkout (Verify checkout page loads)\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite ensures existing functionality remains intact after changes.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Authentication:** Invalid login attempts, password reset failures, registration with invalid data.\n    *   **Product Catalog:** Searching for non-existent products, filtering with invalid criteria.\n    *   **Shopping Cart:** Adding out-of-stock items, applying invalid coupon codes.\n    *   **Checkout & Payments:**  Invalid address formats, declined payment simulations.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   **Concurrency:** Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n    *   **Network Failures:** Simulate network interruptions during checkout.\n    *   **Empty States:**  Empty cart, no search results.\n    *   **Boundary Values:**  Maximum quantity of items in the cart, maximum length of address fields.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   **Input Validation:**  Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.  Specifically, test product search, address fields, and coupon code inputs.\n    *   **Authentication:**  Test for brute-force login attempts.\n    *   **Session Management:**  Verify secure session handling.\n*   **Specific User Goal Regression:**\n    *   Login with `standard_user`\n    *   Sort products by price (low to high)\n    *   Add the lowest-cost item to the cart\n    *   Proceed to checkout\n    *   Complete the purchase successfully\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  A set of pre-defined user accounts (including `standard_user`), product data, and coupon codes.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Generate random email addresses for registration, random product quantities, and variations of address data.\n*   **Data Management:**  Test data will be stored in a centralized repository (e.g., CSV files, database) accessible to all test scripts.  Sensitive data (passwords) will be encrypted.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to improve code maintainability and reduce duplication. Each page of the application should have a corresponding Page Object class that encapsulates the elements and actions on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading.  This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors, such as stale element exceptions.  This could involve refreshing the page or re-locating elements.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for tests that interact with external services (e.g., payment gateways).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:**  Verify product listing and navigation.\n2.  **Login Page:**  Test authentication functionality.\n3.  **Product Detail Page:**  Verify product information and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n4.  **Shopping Cart Page:**  Test cart management features (update quantity, remove items).\n5.  **Checkout Pages (Address, Payment, Confirmation):**  Thoroughly explore the checkout process, including different payment methods and address formats.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected elements are visible on the page (e.g., product name, price, \"Add to Cart\" button).\n    *   Data is displayed correctly (e.g., cart total, order confirmation details).\n    *   Appropriate validation messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).\n    *   Unexpected exceptions or errors in the application logs.\n    *   Incorrect data or missing elements.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).\n    *   Performance degradation (slow page load times).\n"
