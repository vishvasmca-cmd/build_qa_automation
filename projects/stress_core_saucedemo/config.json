  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo E-commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Saucedemo e-commerce application, ensuring comprehensive test coverage and a robust testing framework. This strategy will guide all testing activities, from initial smoke tests to in-depth regression testing, and will be used by the entire engineering team.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: Saucedemo is an e-commerce platform. The most critical areas are Authentication, Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, and Checkout & Payments.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**: Failure in critical areas (Checkout, Payments) can lead to direct financial loss and customer dissatisfaction. Authentication failures can lead to security vulnerabilities and data breaches. Product Catalog and Shopping Cart issues can impact the user experience and sales.\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   All functionalities related to user authentication, product catalog browsing, shopping cart management, and checkout processes.\n        *   Positive and negative test scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.\n        *   Security testing for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 basics).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).\n        *   Performance testing (page load times, transaction processing).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed performance testing beyond basic page load times.\n        *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n        *   Integration with external systems (e.g., shipping providers) beyond basic API validation.\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - to be considered in a later phase.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   Purpose: To quickly verify the core functionality of the application after each build.\n    *   Test Cases:\n        *   Verify application is reachable and loads the login page.\n        *   Successful login with `standard_user` credentials.\n        *   Verify product catalog page loads after login.\n    *   Execution Frequency: After each build deployment.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**:\n    *   Purpose: To ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions and that existing functionality remains intact.\n    *   Test Cases (Based on User Goal and Domain Playbook):\n        *   **Authentication:**\n            *   Login with valid credentials (`standard_user`).\n            *   Login with invalid credentials (incorrect password, locked account).\n            *   Password reset flow.\n        *   **Product Catalog:**\n            *   View product details.\n            *   Sort products by price (low to high, high to low).\n            *   Filter products by category.\n            *   Search for a specific product.\n            *   Verify pagination.\n        *   **Shopping Cart:**\n            *   Add a low-cost item to the cart.\n            *   View cart summary.\n            *   Update quantity in the cart.\n            *   Remove an item from the cart.\n            *   Attempt to add an out-of-stock item (verify error message).\n            *   Verify cart persistence after page refresh.\n        *   **Checkout & Payments:**\n            *   Complete the checkout process with the item in the cart.\n            *   Enter valid shipping information.\n            *   Simulate payment success.\n            *   Simulate payment failure.\n            *   Verify order confirmation page.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid input for login credentials (e.g., SQL injection attempts).\n        *   Invalid shipping address formats.\n        *   Attempting to add more items to the cart than available in stock.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n        *   Network failures during checkout.\n        *   Empty cart scenarios.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on input fields (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\n    *   Execution Frequency: After each build deployment and before major releases.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   Use a combination of static and dynamic test data.\n    *   Static data: Predefined user credentials (`standard_user`, `locked_out_user`, etc.).\n    *   Dynamic data: Generate unique data for each test run (e.g., email addresses, order IDs) to avoid conflicts.\n    *   Consider using a test data management tool to manage and maintain test data.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should have a corresponding page object that encapsulates the elements and actions on that page.\n    *   **Language**: Java or Python (based on team expertise).\n    *   **Test Runner**: JUnit or pytest.\n    *   **Assertion Library**: AssertJ or Hamcrest.\n    *   **Reporting**: Allure or Extent Reports.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., with WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing**: Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common issues, such as element locators changing.  Consider using relative locators or AI-powered self-healing tools.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  Retry failed tests a limited number of times before marking them as failed.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    *   **Login Page**: `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Verify login functionality with different user roles.\n    *   **Product Catalog Page**: `/inventory.html` - Explore product sorting and filtering options.\n    *   **Cart Page**: `/cart.html` - Test adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.\n    *   **Checkout Pages**: `/checkout-step-one.html`, `/checkout-step-two.html`, `/checkout-complete.html` - Verify the entire checkout flow, including shipping information and payment processing.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes**: Verify that all requests return a 200 OK status code for successful operations.\n    *   **Text Visibility**: Verify that expected text is visible on the page (e.g., \"Welcome, standard_user!\", \"Your Cart\", \"Thank you for your order!\").\n    *   **Element Presence**: Verify that key elements are present on the page (e.g., product images, add to cart buttons, checkout button).\n    *   **Data Validation**: Verify that data is displayed correctly (e.g., product prices, cart totals, order details).\n    *   **Error Messages**: Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input or failed operations.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the Saucedemo e-commerce application. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure high-quality software and a positive user experience."
