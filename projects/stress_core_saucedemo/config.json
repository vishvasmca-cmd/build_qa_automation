  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo E-Commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Saucedemo e-commerce application (Target URL: https://www.saucedemo.com/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring the delivery of a high-quality, reliable product.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo is an e-commerce application.  The core business functions revolve around product browsing, adding items to a cart, and completing the checkout process.  Therefore, the following criticality levels apply:\n\n*   **High:** Authentication, Shopping Cart\n*   **Critical:** Checkout & Payments\n*   **Medium:** Product Catalog\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the Saucedemo application can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders results in lost revenue.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Poor user experience due to bugs can damage brand reputation and customer trust.\n*   **Data Security Breach:** Vulnerabilities can expose sensitive user data (e.g., payment information).\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user authentication, product catalog browsing, shopping cart management, and checkout/payment processing.\n*   Functional testing, regression testing, security testing (OWASP Top 10 basics), performance testing (load testing of critical paths).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Mobile responsiveness testing (simulated mobile devices).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed performance testing beyond load testing of critical paths.\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - to be considered in a later phase.\n*   Localization testing (internationalization).\n*   API testing (covered in a separate strategy document).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Purpose:**  Verify the basic health of the application.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   User Login (Valid credentials for `standard_user`)\n    *   Product Catalog Page Load (Verify products are displayed)\n    *   Add Item to Cart (Verify item is added successfully)\n    *   Checkout (Complete purchase with default shipping/payment)\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will be executed to ensure that new changes have not introduced defects into existing functionality.\n\n*   **Purpose:**  Comprehensive testing of all in-scope functionalities.\n*   **Execution Frequency:**  Before each major release and after significant code changes.\n*   **Testing Types:**\n    *   **Functional Testing:** Verify all functionalities work as expected.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid Login attempts (incorrect password, locked account).\n        *   Invalid coupon codes during checkout.\n        *   Adding out-of-stock items to the cart.\n        *   Submitting forms with missing or invalid data.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency: Multiple users accessing and modifying the same cart simultaneously.\n        *   Network failures: Simulate network interruptions during checkout.\n        *   Empty states: Handling empty cart, empty search results.\n        *   Boundary values: Testing minimum and maximum quantities for products.\n    *   **Security Testing (OWASP Top 10 Basics):**\n        *   Input validation: Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.  Focus on login fields, search bar, and address fields.\n        *   Authentication and Session Management: Verify secure handling of user sessions.\n    *   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Execute tests on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.\n    *   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Verify the application renders correctly on different screen sizes.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  Predefined user accounts (e.g., `standard_user`, `locked_out_user`, `problem_user`, `performance_glitch_user`) and product information will be stored in a configuration file or database.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Data such as email addresses, shipping addresses, and credit card numbers will be dynamically generated using libraries or APIs to ensure uniqueness and avoid conflicts.\n*   **Data Management:** A dedicated test data management strategy will be implemented to ensure data consistency and avoid data pollution.  Consider using a database seeding approach to reset the database to a known state before each test run.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class.  This will improve code maintainability and reduce code duplication.  Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.  This will help to mitigate timing issues and improve test stability.\n    *   **Implement Self-Healing:**  Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors, such as retrying failed actions or refreshing the page.\n    *   **Retry Logic:** Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests.\n*   **Environment Stability:** Ensure a stable and reliable test environment.  Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to create consistent and reproducible test environments.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  Focus on different user roles and error handling.\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:**  Explore product filtering, sorting, and search functionalities.\n3.  **Product Details Page:**  Verify product information and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n4.  **Shopping Cart Page:**  Test quantity updates, item removal, and cart persistence.\n5.  **Checkout Page:**  Focus on address input, shipping options, payment processing, and order confirmation.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected elements are visible on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\" text after login, product names on the catalog page).\n    *   Data is displayed correctly (e.g., correct product prices, accurate cart totals).\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n    *   Successful completion of the user goal: Login with `standard_user`, sort products by price, add the lowest-cost item to the cart, and complete the checkout process.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Incorrect data or calculations.\n    *   Missing or broken elements.\n    *   JavaScript errors.\n    *   Inability to complete the user goal.\n"
