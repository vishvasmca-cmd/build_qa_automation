  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Adobe I/O Website - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Adobe I/O website (https://adobe.io). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Adobe I/O is a developer-focused platform. Failure to access or navigate critical sections of the website can hinder developer adoption and integration, impacting Adobe's ecosystem.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **Medium:** Website unavailability or broken navigation can lead to developer frustration and delayed project timelines.\n    *   **Low:** Direct financial loss is unlikely from a simple website outage, but reputational damage and loss of potential integrations are possible.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page rendering.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic accessibility (no broken links).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of each button/link/menu item.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health and accessibility of the Adobe I/O website.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n        *   Login button/link\n        *   Signup/Get Started button/link\n        *   Try for Free button/link\n        *   5 additional buttons (any on the homepage)\n        *   2 links (any on the homepage)\n        *   2 menu bars (typically at the top)\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined separately.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\nThis section provides architectural guidance for building a robust and maintainable test automation framework.\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the Adobe I/O website as a separate class. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains locators and methods for interacting with elements on the homepage (buttons, links, menu bars).\n        *   `LoginPage.java`: (If applicable) Contains locators and methods for the login page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading. This reduces flakiness.\n    *   **Example:** Wait for the \"Login\" button to be present before attempting to interact with it.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Optional):** Explore self-healing capabilities (e.g., using AI-powered tools) to automatically update locators if they change. This is a more advanced technique and can be considered for future enhancements.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\nThis section provides specific instructions for executing the smoke tests and identifying potential issues.\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://adobe.io):** This is the primary target for verifying the presence of key elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"Adobe I/O\" or a relevant title.\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   Element Presence: Verify that each of the required elements (Login, Signup, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) is present on the page using appropriate locators (e.g., XPath, CSS selectors).\n        *   Element Visibility: Verify that each element is visible on the page.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate a clear and concise report indicating whether each test case passed or failed.\n    *   Include screenshots for any failed test cases to aid in debugging.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the Adobe I/O website. It will be reviewed and updated as needed to ensure its continued effectiveness."
