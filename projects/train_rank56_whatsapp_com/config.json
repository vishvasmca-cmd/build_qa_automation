  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: WhatsApp Website - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for smoke testing the WhatsApp website (https://whatsapp.com). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** WhatsApp is a globally used messaging application. The website serves as a marketing and informational portal. Failure of the website to load or critical elements to function can lead to user frustration, brand damage, and potential loss of new user acquisition.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Inability to access the website or critical functionalities (e.g., download links) directly impacts user experience and brand perception.\n    *   **Medium:** Broken links or non-functional buttons can lead to user frustration and reduced engagement.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and load time.\n        *   Presence and basic functionality (visibility) of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action buttons), 2 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of each button/link (e.g., actual login process, signup flow).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid input).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Performance testing (beyond basic load time).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially, focus on desktop view).\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the website is up and running and that key elements are present and visible.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the WhatsApp website (https://whatsapp.com) loads successfully within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        2.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence and visibility of the following elements:\n            *   Login button (or equivalent).\n            *   Signup/Get Started button (or equivalent).\n            *   Try for Free button (or equivalent).\n            *   Two (2) additional buttons (any prominent buttons on the homepage).\n            *   Two (2) links (any prominent links on the homepage).\n            *   Two (2) menu bars (e.g., navigation menu).\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing.  Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for smoke tests, as we are only verifying the presence and visibility of elements.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the WhatsApp website. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class representing the WhatsApp homepage.\n        *   Within the `HomePage` class, define elements (buttons, links, menus) as Page Objects.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for elements to load. This will reduce flakiness.  Example: Wait up to 5 seconds for the Login button to be visible.\n    *   **Element Existence Check:** Before interacting with an element, verify that it exists in the DOM. This can prevent `NoSuchElementException` errors.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://whatsapp.com):** This is the primary target for element identification.\n    2.  **Header/Navigation Bar:** Focus on identifying the main menu elements.\n    3.  **Footer:** Look for links and buttons in the footer section.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP status code 200 (OK).\n    *   **Element Presence:**\n        *   Element is present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n        *   Element is visible on the page (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()` returns `true`).\n        *   Element text (if applicable) matches expected values (e.g., button text is \"Login\").\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed test cases, including screenshots and relevant logs.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for smoke testing the WhatsApp website. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure that the core functionality of the website is validated effectively and efficiently."
