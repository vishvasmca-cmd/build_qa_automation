  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: TripAdvisor.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis Master Test Plan outlines the strategy for smoke testing TripAdvisor.com, a prominent entertainment domain website. The purpose of this plan is to define the scope, objectives, and approach for ensuring the core functionality of the website is operational and meets basic user expectations. The plan focuses on verifying the website's availability, core navigation, and a critical user flow. It also includes instructions for intelligent mining to identify key elements for potential future test scenarios.\n\n## 2.

Smoke Test Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke test suite will focus on validating the basic operability and critical functionalities of TripAdvisor.com.\n\n### 3.1. Objective\n\n*   Verify the website is accessible and responsive.\n*   Confirm core navigation links are functional.\n*   Validate a basic user flow: navigating to the homepage, verifying a headline, and clicking a key call-to-action.\n\n### 3.2. Test Cases\n\n**Test Case 1: Website Availability**\n\n*   **Description:** Verify the TripAdvisor.com website is accessible and returns a successful HTTP status code (200 OK).\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.tripadvisor.com.\n    2.  Verify the page loads successfully.\n*   **Expected Result:** The website loads without errors and returns a 200 OK HTTP status code.\n\n**Test Case 2: Core Navigation**\n\n*   **Description:** Ensure the main menu links are functional and navigate to the expected pages.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.tripadvisor.com.\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu (e.g., \"Hotels,\" \"Restaurants,\" \"Things to Do\").\n    3.  Click each main menu item.\n    4.  Verify that each link navigates to the appropriate page.\n*   **Expected Result:** Each menu link navigates to the corresponding page without errors. Check for page title changes and content relevance.\n\n**Test Case 3: Happy Path - Homepage Headline and \"Start Planning\" Button**\n\n*   **Description:** Navigate to the TripAdvisor homepage, verify the hero headline contains the expected text, and click the \"Start Planning\" button.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.tripadvisor.com.\n    2.  Locate the hero headline.\n    3.  Verify the headline contains the text: \"Know better. Book better. Go better.\"\n    4.  Locate the \"Start Planning\" button.\n    5.  Click the \"Start Planning\" button.\n    6.  Verify that clicking the button navigates to a relevant page (e.g., a search page or a landing page with travel options).\n*   **Expected Result:** The hero headline contains the expected text, the \"Start Planning\" button is clickable, and clicking the button navigates the user to a page where they can start planning their trip.\n\n### 3.3. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:** Windows 10/11 or macOS (latest version)\n\n### 3.4. Test Data\n\n*   No specific test data is required for these smoke tests.\n\n### 3.5. Success Criteria\n\n*   All test cases pass successfully.\n\n### 3.6. Failure Criteria\n\n*   Any test case fails.\n\n## 4. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThe agent should prioritize mining the following elements and pages for future test scenario creation:\n\n*   **Search Functionality:** The main search bar on the homepage and any search filters on search results pages.  Specifically, identify the input fields, dropdown menus, and submit button.\n*   **Booking Forms:**  Explore the booking forms for hotels, flights, and experiences, focusing on input fields, date pickers, and payment options.\n*   **User Review Sections:** Analyze the structure of user reviews, including ratings, text reviews, and any associated metadata (e.g., date, user ID). Extract xpath and selectors.\n*   **Account Management Pages:** Investigate pages related to user registration, login, profile management, and settings.\n*   **Error Messages:**  Trigger and identify all the various error messages on the website, especially those related to the search and booking processes.\n*   **Accessibility elements**: Find and extract all \"aria-label\" attributes for various elements.\n*   **All links in the footer**: Identify each section in the footer and the URLs associated.\n*   **Dynamic Content**: Pay close attention to any dynamically loaded content, such as personalized recommendations or real-time pricing updates.\n\n**Specific Mining Targets:**\n\n*   **Homepage:** Focus on the element containing the headline text to extract its ID, class, and other attributes. Also, identify the element for the \"Start Planning\" button.\n*   **Search Result Pages:**  Identify the elements used to display search results (hotel listings, restaurant listings, etc.), including their titles, descriptions, and review scores.\n\n## 5. Reporting\n\n*   A test report will be generated after the execution of the smoke test suite.\n*   The report will include the status of each test case (Pass/Fail), any encountered errors, and relevant screenshots.\n\n## 6. Automation Considerations\n\n*   The smoke test suite can be automated using tools like Selenium WebDriver, Cypress, or Playwright.\n*   The automation scripts should be designed to be robust and maintainable.\n*   The automation scripts should include clear and concise error handling."
