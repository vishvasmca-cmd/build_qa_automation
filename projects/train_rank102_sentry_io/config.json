  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Sentry.io Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the Sentry.io website smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Sentry.io provides error tracking and performance monitoring. Website availability and core navigation are critical for user acquisition and service accessibility.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website or core navigation can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Potential Customers:** Inability to access signup/trial options.\n    *   **Damage to Reputation:** Website unavailability reflects poorly on service reliability.\n    *   **Reduced User Engagement:** Existing users unable to access documentation or support.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading of the homepage.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, and any other 2 buttons.\n        *   Identification of any 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of any 2 menu bar elements on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Form submission or data entry.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of individual features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the Sentry.io website is accessible and core navigation elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the Sentry.io homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of \"Login\" button.\n        3.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of \"Signup/Get Started\" button.\n        4.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of \"Try for Free\" button.\n        5.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of any other 2 buttons.\n        6.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of any 2 links.\n        7.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of any 2 menu bar elements.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   No test data required as the tests only verify the presence of elements.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement POM to represent the Sentry.io homepage as a Page Object. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   **Technology Stack:** Recommend using Selenium WebDriver with a language like Python or Java for test automation.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with appropriate timeouts to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness due to timing issues. Example: Wait for an element to be present on the page before asserting its existence.\n    *   **Element Existence Checks:** Before interacting with any element, verify that the element exists on the page to prevent `NoSuchElementException`.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://sentry.io):** Focus on identifying the specified buttons, links, and menu bar elements on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load Success:** HTTP response code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bar elements are present on the page (visible or accessible via DOM).\n    *   **No Errors:** No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console during page load.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the Sentry.io smoke test automation. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure the creation of robust and maintainable automated tests that effectively validate the core functionality of the website."
