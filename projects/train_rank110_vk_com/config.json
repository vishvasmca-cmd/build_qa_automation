  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: vk.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the vk.com smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the test automation and execution efforts.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** vk.com is a social networking service. Its business criticality lies in user engagement, content delivery, and platform stability. Failure in core functionalities can lead to user dissatisfaction and potential churn.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failures can result in:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user experience can lead to loss of trust and brand image.\n    *   **Loss of User Engagement:** Inability to access the platform or core features can lead to decreased user activity.\n    *   **Potential Security Vulnerabilities:** While not the primary focus of a smoke test, basic security checks are implicitly included (e.g., ensuring login page loads over HTTPS).\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, 5 other buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence and basic accessibility of these elements.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functional testing of any button or link clicks.\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation (e.g., pixel-perfect rendering).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS verification).\n        *   Mobile testing (unless explicitly stated).\n        *   Localization testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the basic health and accessibility of the vk.com website.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to `https://vk.com` and verify the page loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element Check:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Element Check:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link.\n        4.  **Button Identification (5):** Identify and verify the presence of 5 other distinct buttons on the homepage.\n        5.  **Link Identification (2):** Identify and verify the presence of 2 distinct links on the homepage.\n        6.  **Menu Bar Identification (2):** Identify and verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined separately.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the vk.com homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `HomePage.java` (or equivalent in the chosen language)\n            *   `loginButton` (WebElement)\n            *   `signupLink` (WebElement)\n            *   `button1` (WebElement)\n            *   `button2` (WebElement)\n            *   `button3` (WebElement)\n            *   `button4` (WebElement)\n            *   `button5` (WebElement)\n            *   `link1` (WebElement)\n            *   `link2` (WebElement)\n            *   `menuBar1` (WebElement)\n            *   `menuBar2` (WebElement)\n            *   `isPageLoaded()` (Method to verify the page has loaded - e.g., check for a specific element)\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```java\n        WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));\n        wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id(\"loginButton\")));\n        ```\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed test cases. This can help mitigate intermittent issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://vk.com`):** This is the primary target for identifying the required UI elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 OK and the presence of the main page content (e.g., a logo or a specific heading).\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) must be present and visible on the page. Use appropriate locators (e.g., IDs, CSS selectors, XPaths) to identify these elements.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```java\n        WebElement loginButton = driver.findElement(By.id(\"loginButton\"));\n        assertTrue(loginButton.isDisplayed());\n        ```\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing the vk.com smoke test. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionalities of the website are validated effectively and efficiently."
