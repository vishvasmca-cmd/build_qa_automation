  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Website Health Check (Smoke Test)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://dual-s-msedge.net\n**Business Domain:** General Web Application\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the initial smoke testing phase of the website https://dual-s-msedge.net. This strategy focuses on verifying the core functionality and stability of the application before proceeding with more comprehensive testing.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** As a general web application, the primary risk lies in accessibility and basic functionality. Failure to load, broken links, or non-functional buttons can lead to immediate user frustration and abandonment.\n*   **Risk Profile:** The risk profile is considered *Moderate*. While not a high-stakes domain like e-commerce or banking, a non-functional website damages brand reputation and user trust.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action buttons).\n        *   Identification of at least 5 buttons.\n        *   Identification of at least 2 links.\n        *   Identification of at least 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed functionality of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on a rapid assessment of the website's basic health.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Load:** Verify the website loads successfully without errors (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **UI Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the specified UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for this initial smoke test.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate document after the application stabilizes.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\nThis section provides guidance for setting up the test automation framework.\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent the website's structure. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   **Technology Stack:** Recommend using a robust and widely adopted technology stack such as:\n        *   Programming Language: Python or JavaScript\n        *   Testing Framework: Pytest or Jest/Mocha\n        *   Browser Automation: Selenium or Playwright\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_for_element_to_be_visible`) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network hiccups).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\nThis section provides specific instructions for executing the smoke test.\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** The primary target is the homepage (https://dual-s-msedge.net).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Load:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n        *   No JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n    2.  **UI Element Identification:**\n        *   Presence of \"Login\" button/link.\n        *   Presence of \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link.\n        *   Presence of \"Try for Free\" (or similar call-to-action) button/link.\n        *   Presence of at least 5 distinct buttons.\n        *   Presence of at least 2 distinct links.\n        *   Presence of at least 2 distinct menu bars.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate a clear and concise test report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots of the website in the report for visual verification.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the initial smoke testing phase. Adherence to this strategy will ensure a stable foundation for future testing efforts."
