  "master_plan": "## Master Test Plan: ASOS.com - Smoke Test Suite\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior QA Strategist\n\n### 1. Introduction\n\nThis Master Test Plan outlines the strategy for creating a smoke test suite for ASOS.com. The primary goal is to ensure the website is operational, core navigation is functional, and a key user flow can be executed. This plan will guide the development of automated tests and provide a clear framework for ongoing maintenance.\n\n### 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.asos.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Ecommerce (Fashion Retail)\n*   **Target Audience:** Young adults and fashion-conscious individuals seeking a wide variety of clothing, shoes, accessories, and beauty products.\n*   **Key Functionality:**\n    *   Product browsing and search\n    *   User account management (registration, login, profile management)\n    *   Shopping cart and checkout process\n    *   Order management and tracking\n    *   Customer support and information resources\n*   **Technical Considerations:**\n    *   Responsive design for various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)\n    *   Integration with payment gateways\n    *   Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast asset delivery\n    *   Personalized content and recommendations\n\n### 3. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke test suite will focus on the most critical functionalities to ensure the basic health and stability of the ASOS website.\n\n#### 3.1. Smoke Test Goals\n\n*   Verify that the ASOS website is accessible and loads correctly.\n*   Ensure that core navigation elements are functional.\n*   Confirm that users can successfully navigate the homepage and find critical elements.\n\n#### 3.2. Test Cases\n\n**Test Case 1: Website Availability**\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the ASOS website is accessible and returns a successful HTTP status code (200).\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.asos.com\n    2.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200.\n*   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully with a 200 status code.\n\n**Test Case 2: Core Navigation - Menu Links**\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the main menu links are present and clickable.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.asos.com\n    2.  Locate the main menu (e.g., \"Women,\" \"Men,\" \"Marketplace\").\n    3.  Iterate through each main menu item.\n    4.  Verify that each link is present and clickable.\n*   **Expected Result:** All main menu links are present, clickable, and navigate to the correct corresponding pages.\n\n**Test Case 3: Core Flow - Homepage Hero Navigation**\n\n*   **Description:** Navigate to ASOS homepage. Verify the hero headline contains 'Discover fashion online'. Find and click the 'Shop Now' button.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.asos.com\n    2.  Verify the hero headline contains 'Discover fashion online'.\n    3.  Locate the \"Shop Now\" button within the hero section.\n    4.  Click the \"Shop Now\" button.\n    5.  Verify that the user is redirected to a relevant product listing page.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The hero headline contains the expected text.\n    *   The \"Shop Now\" button is clickable.\n    *   Clicking the button redirects the user to a relevant product listing page.\n\n### 4. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions are designed to guide the agent in identifying and interacting with key elements on the ASOS website, focusing on areas critical to the smoke test suite.\n\n*   **Prioritized Pages:**\n    *   Homepage (https://www.asos.com)\n\n*   **Elements to Mine:**\n\n    *   **Homepage:**\n        *   **Hero Section:**\n            *   Headline text: Extract the text content of the main headline to verify its content.\n            *   \"Shop Now\" button: Identify the button's selector (CSS or XPath) and attributes (text, link URL).\n        *   **Main Navigation Menu:**\n            *   Identify all top-level menu items (e.g., \"Women,\" \"Men,\" \"Marketplace\"). Extract their text and link URLs.\n        *   **Footer:**\n            *   Locate and extract links from the footer, especially those related to customer service (\"Help,\" \"Contact Us\")\n\n*   **Mining Strategies:**\n\n    1.  **Prioritize elements based on their visual prominence and location on the page.**  The hero section and main navigation are the most important.\n    2.  **Use a combination of CSS selectors and XPath to locate elements.** XPath is useful for elements that lack unique CSS classes or IDs, or for navigating the DOM structure.\n    3.  **Pay attention to ARIA attributes** (e.g., `aria-label`) for accessibility, as these can provide useful information for identifying elements.\n    4.  **Account for dynamic content.** ASOS.com likely uses A/B testing or personalization, so element attributes might change. Use robust selectors and verify element properties before interacting with them.\n\n### 5. Reporting\n\n*   The autonomous agent should generate a detailed report after each test run.\n*   The report should include:\n    *   Test case execution status (Pass/Fail)\n    *   Screenshots of failed test cases\n    *   Error messages and logs\n    *   Execution time for each test case\n    *   Overall smoke test suite status\n\n### 6. Maintenance\n\n*   This Master Test Plan should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes to the ASOS website.\n*   Test cases should be updated or added as new features are introduced.\n*   The smoke test suite should be executed automatically on a scheduled basis (e.g., nightly) to ensure ongoing website stability.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for building a robust smoke test suite for ASOS.com. By following these guidelines, the autonomous agent can effectively identify and verify critical functionalities, ensuring the website remains operational and user-friendly."
