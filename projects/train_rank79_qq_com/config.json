  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: qq.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the initial smoke testing of qq.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the website.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** qq.com is a high-traffic general web portal. While not directly transactional, its availability and core functionality are critical for user engagement and maintaining brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionality (e.g., website launch, finding key elements) can lead to significant user frustration, loss of traffic, and damage to brand reputation.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Successful website launch.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key UI elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar), and any other two prominent buttons.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of two prominent links.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of two menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicking).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially, focus on desktop).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Negative testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to `https://qq.com` and verify the page loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button (or equivalent) is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or equivalent button is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" (or similar) button is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify the presence of another prominent button.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify the presence of another prominent button.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify the presence of a prominent link.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify the presence of a prominent link.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify the presence of a menu bar.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify the presence of a menu bar.\n    *   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n*   **Regression Suite:**  *(Not applicable for this initial smoke test. This section would be populated for future regression testing efforts.)*\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No test data is required for this smoke test, as it only verifies the presence of UI elements.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   Implement a basic Page Object Model (POM) structure.  Create a `HomePage` object that represents the qq.com homepage. This object should contain locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars. This will facilitate maintainability as the website evolves.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be present for a short duration) to handle potential timing issues during page load.\n    *   **Locator Strategy:**  Prioritize robust locators (e.g., IDs, ARIA attributes) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://qq.com`):** This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code AND page title contains \"\u817e\u8baf\u7f51\" (or equivalent).\n    *   **Button/Link/Menu Bar Presence:** Element is present in the DOM AND is visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for any failed test cases.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for the initial smoke testing of qq.com.  It will be reviewed and updated as the application evolves and more comprehensive testing is required."
