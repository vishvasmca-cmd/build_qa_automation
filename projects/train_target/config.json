  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: Target.com Smoke Test Suite\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for the smoke test suite for Target.com. The primary goal is to ensure the website is operational, core navigation is functioning, and a critical user flow (navigating to the homepage and interacting with the hero section) is successfully executed. This test plan will guide the autonomous agents in mining relevant data, verifying functionality, and structuring the test suite.\n\n## 2. Domain Information\n\n**Website URL:** https://www.target.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce (Retail)\n**Domain Analysis:**\n\n*   Target.com is a large-scale e-commerce platform offering a wide range of products, including home goods, clothing, electronics, groceries, and more.\n*   The primary business goal is to facilitate online sales and provide a seamless shopping experience for customers.\n*   The website likely handles a high volume of traffic and requires robust infrastructure and reliable functionality.\n*   Key areas of focus include product browsing, search, shopping cart, checkout, account management, and customer service.\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nThis smoke test suite covers the following:\n\n*   Website availability and basic functionality.\n*   Core navigation links within the main menu.\n*   Verification of the homepage hero section headline.\n*   Clicking the \"Shop Now\" button on the homepage hero section.\n\n## 4. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThis section details the specific tests included in the smoke suite.\n\n### 4.1. Website Availability Test\n\n**Test ID:** SMOKE-001\n**Description:** Verifies that the Target.com website is accessible and returns a successful HTTP status code (200).\n**Steps:**\n\n1.  Navigate to https://www.target.com.\n2.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200.\n\n**Expected Result:** The website should load successfully and return an HTTP status code of 200.\n\n### 4.2. Core Navigation Test\n\n**Test ID:** SMOKE-002\n**Description:** Checks the functionality of the main navigation menu links.\n**Steps:**\n\n1.  Navigate to https://www.target.com.\n2.  Locate the main navigation menu.  (Agent Instruction: Mine all `<a>` tags within the `<nav>` or `<header>` elements, prioritizing those with `aria-label=\"main\"` or `role=\"navigation\"` attributes. Also look for `<button>` elements that control the expansion of the menu)\n3.  Iterate through each link in the main navigation menu.\n4.  Click each link.\n5.  Verify that the page loads successfully (HTTP status code 200) and that the URL changes accordingly.\n**Expected Result:** All main navigation links should be functional and redirect to the correct pages without errors.\n\n### 4.3. Homepage Hero Section Verification Test\n\n**Test ID:** SMOKE-003\n**Description:** Verifies the content and functionality of the homepage hero section.\n**Steps:**\n\n1.  Navigate to https://www.target.com.\n2.  Locate the hero headline element. (Agent Instruction: Mine the `<h1>` or `<h2>` element within the first `<section>` or `<div>` element after the `<header>`, paying attention to `aria-label` attributes that might describe this section as the \"hero\" or \"main banner\".)\n3.  Verify that the hero headline text contains \"Expect more. Pay less.\".\n4.  Locate the \"Shop Now\" button within the hero section. (Agent Instruction: Mine for `<a>` or `<button>` tags within the same section as the headline, containing text like \"Shop Now,\" \"Explore,\" or similar calls to action.)\n5.  Click the \"Shop Now\" button.\n6.  Verify that the page navigates to a relevant shopping page (e.g., a product category page or a promotional page). (Agent Instruction: Log the target URL and ensure it is not a generic error page. Check for URL parameters related to the promotion displayed within the hero section, e.g. `promotion=hero_banner`).\n\n**Expected Result:** The hero headline should contain the correct text, and the \"Shop Now\" button should redirect to a relevant shopping page.\n\n## 5. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThis section provides specific instructions for the autonomous agents to efficiently mine the necessary information for test execution.\n\n*   **Main Navigation Menu:** Prioritize mining `<a>` tags within `<nav>` or `<header>` elements with `aria-label=\"main\"` or `role=\"navigation\"` attributes. Also, be aware of `<button>` elements used to control the expansion of a hamburger menu. Mine the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tags.\n*   **Hero Section Headline:** Focus on mining `<h1>` or `<h2>` elements within the first `<section>` or `<div>` element after the `<header>`.  Examine `aria-label` attributes for descriptions like \"hero\" or \"main banner\". Extract the text content of the identified element.\n*   **\"Shop Now\" Button:** Search for `<a>` or `<button>` tags within the same section as the headline, containing text like \"Shop Now,\" \"Explore,\" or similar calls to action. Mine the `href` attribute if it is an `<a>` tag.\n*   **Dynamic Content:** Be aware that the hero section content may be dynamic and change frequently. The agent should be able to adapt to different headline text and button destinations while still verifying the core functionality.\n\n## 6. Out-of-Scope\n\nThe following are explicitly excluded from this smoke test suite:\n\n*   Product browsing and search functionality.\n*   Shopping cart and checkout process.\n*   Account management features.\n*   Customer service functionalities.\n*   UI/UX visual testing.\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Mobile-specific testing (this plan focuses on the desktop website).\n*   Accessibility testing.\n\n## 7. Test Environment\n\n*   The tests should be executed against the production environment (https://www.target.com).\n\n## 8. Test Data\n\n*   No specific test data is required for this smoke test suite.\n\n## 9. Success Criteria\n\n*   All tests in the smoke suite must pass for the build to be considered stable and ready for further testing.\n\n## 10. Reporting\n\n*   A clear and concise test report should be generated after each execution of the smoke test suite.\n*   The report should include the status of each test (pass/fail), execution time, and any relevant error messages or screenshots.\n\n## 11. Future Considerations\n\n*   As the application evolves, the smoke test suite should be updated to reflect new features and functionalities.\n*   Consider expanding the smoke test suite to include additional critical user flows.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a comprehensive guide for creating a robust and effective smoke test suite for Target.com. By following these guidelines, the autonomous agents can efficiently mine data, verify functionality, and ensure the website's stability and core functionality."
