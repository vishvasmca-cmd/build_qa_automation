  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: The Guardian Website (Smoke Testing)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Guardian website (https://theguardian.com). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The Guardian is a major news publication. System failures can lead to loss of readership, reputational damage, and potential financial impact.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. While not directly transactional (e.g., e-commerce), accessibility and availability are critical for maintaining readership and public trust.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page rendering.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially focus on desktop).\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n        *   Error handling and negative scenarios.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Guardian homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of at least five (5) buttons (e.g., Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, Subscribe, etc.).\n        3.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least two (2) links (e.g., \"News\", \"Sport\", \"Culture\", \"About Us\", etc.).\n        4.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least two (2) menu bars (e.g., main navigation, footer navigation).\n    *   **Data Strategy:** Static. No dynamic test data generation is required for smoke tests.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (N/A):**  Regression testing is not part of this initial smoke test strategy. It will be defined in a separate document.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM). This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n    *   Create Page Objects for:\n        *   Homepage\n        *   Common UI elements (e.g., Header, Footer)\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be present) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://theguardian.com):** Focus on identifying buttons, links, and menu bars within the main content area, header, and footer.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the Guardian logo or title text.\n    *   **Element Identification:** The automated test must successfully locate and identify the specified number of buttons, links, and menu bars using appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath).  The test should assert that the elements are present on the page.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed tests, including screenshots or other relevant information."
