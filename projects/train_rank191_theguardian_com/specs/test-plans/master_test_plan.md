This document outlines the test plan for train_rank191_theguardian_com, a general web application. The plan details the testing scope, strategy, and deliverables.

## 2. Scope

The testing will cover the core functionality of the website, focusing on navigation, key button and link identification, and menu bar presence. This includes verifying the presence and accessibility of critical elements without necessarily interacting with them.

## 3. Test Strategy

Two main test suites will be employed:

*   **Smoke Suite:** A minimal set of tests to ensure the basic functionality is working.
*   **Regression Suite:** A comprehensive suite to ensure new changes haven't broken existing functionality.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The Smoke Suite will adhere to the following 8-point checklist:

1.  **Critical Paths:** Verify the main navigation to the homepage.
2.  **Core Business Logic:** N/A (General web application, no specific business logic in this initial trace).
3.  **No Negative Testing:** Only positive checks for element presence.
4.  **No Complex Edge Cases:** Focus on basic accessibility.
5.  **Fast Execution:** Tests should be quick to run.
6.  **Automated:** Designed for automated execution.
7.  **Build Validation:** Failure indicates a broken build.
