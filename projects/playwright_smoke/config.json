  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document for Playwright.dev, focusing on the smoke test scenario you've provided. This document is designed to guide the engineering team and ensure a robust testing approach from the outset.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Playwright.dev Smoke Test\n\n**Application:** Playwright.dev (Documentation Website)\n**Test Type:** Smoke\n**Last Updated:** October 26, 2023\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The application is a documentation website for Playwright. While not directly revenue-generating, its availability is critical for developer adoption and satisfaction. Outages or critical errors severely impact Playwright's reputation and developer experience.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Website unavailability, critical errors preventing access to essential documentation.\n    *   **Medium:** Broken links on the homepage, inability to navigate to core documentation sections.\n    *   **Low:** Minor visual defects, non-critical content errors.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Homepage loading and rendering.\n        *   Verification of the main heading text.\n        *   Clickability and navigation from the \"Get Started\" button.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Testing every link on the site.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (for the initial smoke test).\n        *   Detailed content validation.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing (initial smoke - defer to later regression).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):** This suite will be executed upon every build deployment. If *any* test in this suite fails, the build is considered broken and should be immediately investigated.\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **Heading Verification:** Verify the main heading \"Playwright enables reliable end-to-end testing\" is visible on the homepage.\n    3.  **\"Get Started\" Navigation:** Verify the \"Get Started\" button is clickable and navigates to the expected page (e.g., `/docs/intro`).\n*   **Regression Suite (Deferred):** Initially, the regression suite will be minimal. As the application evolves, this will expand to include:\n    *   Link validation across key documentation pages.\n    *   Form submission testing within documentation examples (if applicable).\n    *   Browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).\n    *   Accessibility checks.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For the smoke test, data is static. No test data generation is required. The tests are primarily verifying UI elements and navigation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Essential for maintainability. Create Page Objects for:\n        *   `HomePage`: Encapsulates the homepage elements and interactions.\n        *   `GettingStartedPage`: Represents the target page after clicking \"Get Started\".\n    *   Consider using Playwright's built-in test runner and assertions.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use Playwright's `waitForSelector` or similar mechanisms to handle potential delays in element rendering.  Instead of immediately failing, the test should retry for a short period.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future):**  As the test suite grows, explore techniques like automatically retrying failed tests or using AI-powered element locators.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts instead of relying solely on implicit waits.\n    *   **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent from each other. Clearing browser cookies/storage might be needed between tests.\n*   **Reporting:** Integrate with a reporting tool to provide clear test results. Allure or similar tools are recommended for detailed reporting and analysis.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (For Autonomous Agents/Exploration):**  While autonomous exploration isn't a primary focus for the *smoke* test, prioritize these initial pages for future regression testing coverage:\n    *   The homepage (as tested in the smoke suite).\n    *   The `/docs/intro` page (target of the \"Get Started\" button).\n    *   Any pages linked prominently from the homepage navigation.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 OK for all page requests.\n        *   The main heading text is present and matches the expected value.\n        *   Clicking \"Get Started\" navigates to the correct page.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   Any HTTP error codes (4xx, 5xx).\n        *   Missing or incorrect heading text.\n        *   The \"Get Started\" button is not clickable or navigates to the wrong page.\n*   **Execution Environment:**\n    *   Run the smoke tests in a dedicated CI/CD pipeline.\n    *   Configure the tests to run automatically on every code commit or pull request.\n\nThis document serves as the initial blueprint. It will be updated as the application evolves and the testing strategy matures. Good luck!"
