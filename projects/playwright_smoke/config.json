  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Playwright.dev Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the smoke test of the Playwright.dev website. It will serve as the guiding document for all testing activities related to this specific scope.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Playwright.dev is a documentation website. The primary business goal is to provide users with clear and accessible information about the Playwright testing framework. A failure in this area directly impacts user adoption and satisfaction with the framework.\n\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Inaccessibility of key documentation negatively impacts user adoption and developer experience.\n    *   **Medium:** Website navigation issues leading to user frustration and inefficient information gathering.\n    *   **Low:** Minor visual defects or less critical content being unavailable.\n\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and accessibility.\n        *   Navigation to the homepage.\n        *   Verification of the main heading \"Playwright enables reliable end-to-end testing\".\n        *   Clicking the \"Get Started\" button.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   In-depth testing of all documentation pages.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (beyond initial verification).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Detailed UI/UX testing (beyond heading visibility and button click).\n        *   Testing of external links (other than the \"Get Started\" button target).\n        *   Testing of localized versions of the website (if applicable).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis test strategy focuses on quickly validating the core functionality for new deployments.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** Navigate to `https://playwright.dev/`.\n    2.  **Heading Verification:** Verify the main heading \"Playwright enables reliable end-to-end testing\" is visible on the page.\n    3.  **\"Get Started\" Navigation:** Click the \"Get Started\" button and verify the target page loads successfully.\n*   **Regression Suite:**\n    *   _Given the limited scope of the smoke test, a dedicated regression suite is not required. Any failures in the smoke test MUST trigger a full regression cycle on the relevant area(s) after the fix._\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The test focuses on verifying the existence and visibility of elements on the page.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\nThe architecture should be lightweight and focused on speed and reliability.\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   Utilize a simplified Page Object Model (POM) structure. A single page object for the homepage is sufficient for this smoke test. Future regression tests might require more elaborate POM structure.\n    *   Leverage the native features of the chosen automation framework (e.g., Playwright) for locating elements and performing actions.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions with appropriate timeouts for verifying the visibility of the main heading and successful page load after the \"Get Started\" button click. This accounts for potential network latency.\n        *   Example: Instead of `Assert.IsTrue(heading.Displayed)`, use `WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)).Until(drv => heading.Displayed);`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire test in case of intermittent network issues or temporary website unavailability. Limit the number of retries to a reasonable value (e.g., 2-3).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\nThese instructions are for the Senior QA overseeing the automation effort.\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n\n    1.  `https://playwright.dev/` (Homepage)\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** HTTP status code 200 AND the HTML `<head>` element is present.\n    2.  **Heading Verification:** The main heading \"Playwright enables reliable end-to-end testing\" is VISIBLE within 10 seconds.\n    3.  **\"Get Started\" Navigation:**\n        *   The \"Get Started\" button is clickable.\n        *   Clicking the button results in navigation to a new page.\n        *   The new page loads successfully (HTTP status code 200).\n*   **Reporting:** Any failure in the smoke test must be immediately reported and investigated. The root cause of the failure should be identified and addressed before proceeding with further testing."
