  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Book Search and Details - DemoQA\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the book search and details functionality on the DemoQA website (https://demoqa.com/books). It will serve as the blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding all testing activities, from manual exploration to automated regression suites.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: The DemoQA website is a demonstration platform. While not a live production environment, ensuring the book search and detail functionality works correctly is crucial for showcasing the application's capabilities and providing a positive user experience.\n\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failure of this functionality could lead to:\n    *   **Minor Trust Loss**: Users may perceive the application as unreliable if basic functionality is broken.\n    *   **Reduced Demo Value**: The application's demonstration value diminishes if core features are not functional.\n\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Book search functionality (keyword search).\n        *   Book details page display.\n        *   Navigation between search results and book details.\n        *   Basic UI elements on the search results and details pages.\n        *   Error handling for invalid search queries.\n        *   Responsiveness of the search results and details pages across different screen sizes.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   User account creation/login functionality (unless directly related to book details).\n        *   Integration with external APIs (unless specifically related to displaying book information).\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress) beyond basic page load times.\n        *   Advanced accessibility testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n**2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)**\n\n*   **Definition:** A minimal set of tests to verify that the core book search and details functionality is operational after each build.\n\n*   **Tests:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://demoqa.com/books`.\n    2.  Search for a known book title (e.g., \"Speaking JavaScript\").\n    3.  Verify that at least one search result is displayed.\n    4.  Click on the search result.\n    5.  Verify that the book details page loads correctly with the book title displayed.\n\n**2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**\n\n*   **Search Functionality Tests:**\n    1.  **Positive Search**: Search for existing book titles, authors, and ISBNs. Verify accurate results.\n    2.  **Partial Match**: Search using partial book titles or author names. Verify that relevant results are displayed.\n    3.  **Case Insensitivity**: Verify searches are case-insensitive.\n    4.  **No Results**: Search for non-existing books. Verify \"No Results Found\" message is displayed gracefully.\n    5.  **Special Characters**: Search with special characters in the search query (e.g., \"C++\", \"O'Reilly\").\n    6.  **Boundary Testing**: Search with very short (1 character) and very long search queries (255 characters).\n    7.  **Empty Search**: Submit an empty search query. Validate behavior (e.g., displays all books, or shows an error message).\n\n*   **Book Details Page Tests:**\n    1.  **Content Verification**: Verify that all book details (title, author, ISBN, description, publisher) are displayed correctly.\n    2.  **Link Validation**: Verify that any links on the page are functional (e.g., author links, publisher website).\n    3.  **Image Verification**: Verify the book cover image is displayed correctly.\n    4.  **Responsiveness**: Verify the book details page renders correctly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n    5.  **Negative Testing**: Ensure the page handles missing or invalid book data gracefully (e.g., a book with no author).\n\n*   **Navigation Tests:**\n    1.  **Search to Details**: Verify that clicking on a search result navigates to the correct book details page.\n    2.  **Back Button**: Verify the browser back button returns to the search results page.\n    3.  **Page Reload**: Verify that reloading the book details page maintains the page state and displays the same content.\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    1.  **Concurrent Searches**: Simulate multiple users searching simultaneously.\n    2.  **Network Failures**: Test the application's behavior when the network connection is slow or interrupted.\n    3.  **Empty States**: Verify that the UI handles empty search results or missing book details gracefully.\n\n*   **Security:**\n    1.  **XSS Prevention**: Inject potential XSS payloads into the search query. Verify that the application does not execute malicious code.\n    2.  **SQL Injection Prevention**: Inject potential SQL injection payloads into the search query. Verify that the application is not vulnerable.\n\n**2.3 Data Strategy**\n\n*   **Static Data**: A set of known book titles, authors, and ISBNs will be used for positive search tests. This data can be stored in a configuration file or database.\n*   **Dynamic Data**: For negative tests, generate invalid search queries and book data dynamically.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**: Implement a **Page Object Model (POM)**. This pattern promotes code reusability and maintainability by encapsulating page elements and interactions into separate classes.\n    *   `BookSearchPage`: Responsible for handling search input and displaying results.\n    *   `BookDetailsPage`: Responsible for displaying book details and related actions.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations (e.g., waiting for search results to load).  This prevents flakiness caused by timing issues.  Example:  `waitUntil(() => searchResults.isDisplayed(), 5000, \"Search results not displayed after 5 seconds\")`\n    *   **Self-Healing**: Implement a basic self-healing mechanism to automatically retry failed interactions (e.g., clicking a button that fails to load). This should be done judiciously to avoid masking genuine issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**: The autonomous agent should prioritize exploration of the following pages/flows:\n    1.  `https://demoqa.com/books`: Focus on the search input field and the initial display of book results.\n    2.  Book Details Pages: Explore various book details pages, paying attention to the consistency and accuracy of the displayed information.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **HTTP Status Code 200**: For all page requests, verify that the server returns an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Expected Elements Present**: Verify that key UI elements are present on the page (e.g., search input field, book title, author name).\n    *   **Accurate Data Display**: Verify that book details are displayed accurately and consistently across the search results and details pages. Example: Check if the text \"Speaking JavaScript\" is visible on the Book Details page after searching for \"Speaking JavaScript\".\n    *   **No JavaScript Errors**: Monitor the browser console for JavaScript errors.  Any errors should be investigated and addressed."
