  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: E-Commerce Book Search Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the e-commerce book search application located at `https://demoqa.com/books`. This strategy will guide all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimizing risks associated with software defects.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe application falls under the e-commerce domain, specifically focused on books. Key functionalities include:\n\n*   **Book Search:** Allows users to find books based on various criteria.\n*   **Book Details:** Displays detailed information about a specific book.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of this application can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to purchase books.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user experience due to errors or unavailability.\n*   **Data Security Risks:** Potential exposure of user data if security vulnerabilities exist.\n\nTherefore, a robust testing strategy is crucial to mitigate these risks.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Search Functionality:**\n    *   Keyword search\n    *   Author search (if applicable)\n    *   Category/Genre search (if applicable)\n    *   Filtering and sorting of search results\n*   **Book Details Page:**\n    *   Display of book title, author, description, price, and other relevant information.\n    *   Availability status (e.g., \"In Stock,\" \"Out of Stock\").\n    *   Add to cart functionality (if present).\n    *   Reviews and ratings (if present).\n*   **Basic UI/UX:**\n    *   Responsiveness across different browsers and devices.\n    *   Accessibility (basic checks).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input validation to prevent basic XSS and SQL injection attacks.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Shopping Cart and Checkout:** (Assumed to be covered by other test strategies)\n*   **User Account Management:** (Assumed to be covered by other test strategies)\n*   **Payment Processing:** (Assumed to be covered by other test strategies)\n*   **Advanced Accessibility Testing:** (Requires specialized tools and expertise)\n*   **Performance Testing:** (Requires specialized tools and expertise)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will verify the core functionality of the application.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://demoqa.com/books`.\n    2.  Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    3.  Search for a known book title (e.g., \"Git Pocket Guide\").\n    4.  Verify that the search results are displayed.\n    5.  Click on a book title in the search results.\n    6.  Verify that the book details page loads successfully.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass. Failure of any test case indicates a critical issue and should block further testing.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive testing of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Search with invalid keywords (e.g., special characters, very long strings).\n    *   Search with no keywords (empty search).\n    *   Attempt to access book details page with an invalid book ID (if possible).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Search for books with unusual characters in the title or author name.\n    *   Search for books with very long titles or descriptions.\n    *   Simultaneous searches from multiple users (basic concurrency).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input validation testing on search fields to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.\n    *   Inspect HTTP headers for security-related configurations (e.g., Content Security Policy).\n*   **Functional Testing:**\n    *   Verify search results are accurate and relevant.\n    *   Verify book details page displays all required information correctly.\n    *   Verify availability status is accurate.\n    *   Verify filtering and sorting of search results (if applicable).\n*   **UI/UX Testing:**\n    *   Verify responsiveness across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n    *   Verify responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n    *   Verify basic accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, alt text for images).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:**\n    *   **Static Data:** A set of predefined book titles, authors, and descriptions will be used for basic testing.\n    *   **Dynamic Generation:** For negative testing, dynamically generate invalid input data (e.g., long strings, special characters).\n    *   **Data Source:** Test data will be stored in a CSV or JSON file and managed within the test framework.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   **Example:** Create a `BookSearchPage` class to encapsulate the search functionality and a `BookDetailsPage` class to represent the book details page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met. This will help to mitigate issues caused by slow loading times or asynchronous operations.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific elements to be interactable before performing actions.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically retry failed actions or locate elements using alternative locators.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Book Search Page (`https://demoqa.com/books`):** Focus on the search input field and search results.\n2.  **Book Details Page:** Explore the different elements on the book details page, such as the title, author, description, and price.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that all pages return an HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that key elements on each page are visible (e.g., search input field, book titles, book details).\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text is present on the page (e.g., \"Book Store,\" \"Author,\" \"Description\").\n    *   **Search Results:** Verify that search results are displayed and that the number of results is reasonable.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the e-commerce book search application. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the quality, reliability, and security of the application.\n"
