  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Mail.ru Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Mail.ru smoke test, focusing on verifying the core functionality and stability of the application. This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Mail.ru is a high-traffic web portal offering email, news, and other services. Its availability and core functionalities are critical for user engagement and business operations.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities (login, navigation) can lead to significant user dissatisfaction, loss of trust, and potential revenue impact.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual services (email, news, etc.).\n        *   Clicking and navigating through links or buttons.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Mail.ru homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar registration button is present and visible.\n        4.  **\"Try for Free\" Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar button is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Generic 1):** Verify any other button is present and visible.\n        6.  **Button Presence (Generic 2):** Verify any other button is present and visible.\n        7.  **Link Presence (Generic 1):** Verify any link is present and visible.\n        8.  **Link Presence (Generic 2):** Verify any other link is present and visible.\n        9.  **Menu Bar Presence (Generic 1):** Verify a menu bar is present and visible.\n        10. **Menu Bar Presence (Generic 2):** Verify another menu bar is present and visible.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for a smoke test.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on UI element presence.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Mail.ru homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class with methods to identify and verify the presence of the required UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays and ensure elements are fully rendered before verification.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to handle dynamic content loading and avoid premature assertion failures.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Mail.ru Homepage (https://mail.ru):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 and the presence of the main Mail.ru logo or title.\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are visible on the page. Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify the elements.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clearly report any failures with detailed error messages and screenshots.\n    *   Track test execution results and identify any recurring issues."
