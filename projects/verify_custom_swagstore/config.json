  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the SauceDemo e-commerce application (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding test planning, execution, and automation efforts.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSauceDemo is an e-commerce application. The core business functions revolve around product browsing, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process.\n\n*   **Criticality:** High. As an e-commerce platform, failures directly impact revenue generation and customer satisfaction.\n*   **P0 Flows:** Login, Product Browsing, Add to Cart, Checkout (Payment Processing - simulated in this case).\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nSystem failures can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders, incorrect pricing, failed transactions.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative customer experiences, loss of trust.\n*   **Data Security Breaches:** (Less critical in this demo app, but important to consider in real-world e-commerce).\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All core e-commerce functionalities:\n    *   User Authentication (Login/Logout)\n    *   Product Catalog Browsing\n    *   Product Details Page\n    *   Shopping Cart Management (Add, Remove, Update Quantities)\n    *   Checkout Process (Shipping Information, Payment Information - simulated)\n    *   Order Confirmation\n*   UI/UX validation across different browsers and screen sizes (Responsive Design).\n*   Error handling and validation messages.\n*   Basic security checks (input sanitization).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n*   API testing (unless explicitly required).\n*   Database testing (beyond basic data integrity checks).\n*   Third-party integrations (unless specifically identified as high-risk).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite provides a rapid health check of the application.\n\n*   **Frequency:** Executed after every build deployment.\n*   **Goal:** Verify core functionality is operational.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Verify Login with valid credentials (standard\\_user/secret\\_sauce).\n    2.  Verify successful navigation to the Products page after login.\n    3.  Verify at least one product is displayed on the Products page.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite ensures that new changes haven't introduced regressions in existing functionality.\n\n*   **Frequency:** Executed after significant code changes or feature additions.\n*   **Goal:** Comprehensive validation of all in-scope functionalities.\n*   **Test Areas:**\n    *   **User Authentication:**\n        *   Valid login credentials (standard\\_user, locked\\_out\\_user, problem\\_user, performance\\_glitch\\_user)\n        *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect username/password)\n        *   Logout functionality\n    *   **Product Catalog Browsing:**\n        *   Verify product listing display (name, price, image)\n        *   Verify product sorting (by price, name)\n        *   Verify product filtering (if applicable)\n    *   **Product Details Page:**\n        *   Verify product details display (description, image, price)\n        *   Verify \"Add to Cart\" functionality\n    *   **Shopping Cart Management:**\n        *   Add products to the cart\n        *   Remove products from the cart\n        *   Update product quantities in the cart\n        *   Verify cart total calculation\n        *   Verify \"Continue Shopping\" functionality\n        *   Verify \"Checkout\" functionality\n    *   **Checkout Process:**\n        *   Enter shipping information (first name, last name, postal code)\n        *   Verify error handling for invalid shipping information\n        *   Verify order summary display\n        *   \"Finish\" the checkout process (simulated payment)\n        *   Verify order confirmation message\n        *   Verify \"Back Home\" functionality\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid input in forms (e.g., special characters in name fields)\n        *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart (if applicable)\n        *   Navigating to restricted pages without authentication\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Adding a large number of items to the cart\n        *   Simultaneous user access (concurrency - basic simulation)\n        *   Handling network errors (simulated)\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks (check form fields).\n        *   Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities (though unlikely in this demo app).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined user credentials (standard\\_user/secret\\_sauce, etc.), product names, and descriptions.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generated shipping information (first name, last name, postal code) to avoid data duplication and ensure test independence.  Consider using libraries like Faker.js for dynamic data generation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended.  This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n    *   Create separate page object classes for each page in the application (e.g., LoginPage, ProductsPage, CartPage, CheckoutPage).\n    *   Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n    *   Test cases should interact with the application through the page objects.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Mitigation:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable before interacting with them. This helps to avoid timing issues and flaky tests.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to handle asynchronous operations.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI-powered element locators) to automatically adapt to UI changes.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/) - Focus on different user credentials and error handling.\n2.  **Products Page:** (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/inventory.html) - Explore product listing, sorting, and filtering (if implemented).\n3.  **Product Details Page:** (Click on any product) - Verify product details and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n4.  **Shopping Cart Page:** (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/cart.html) - Explore adding, removing, and updating product quantities.\n5.  **Checkout Pages:** (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/checkout-step-one.html, https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/checkout-step-two.html, https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/checkout-complete.html) - Focus on shipping information, order summary, and order confirmation.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected elements are visible on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\" text after login, product names on the Products page).\n    *   Form submissions are successful (e.g., successful login, successful addition to cart, successful checkout).\n    *   Validation messages are displayed correctly for invalid input.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).\n    *   Unexpected exceptions or errors in the browser console.\n    *   Incorrect data displayed on the page.\n    *   Broken links or images.\n    *   Inability to complete core business flows.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the SauceDemo e-commerce application. It will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changes in the application and the evolving testing landscape.\n"
