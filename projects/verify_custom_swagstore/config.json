  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo v1 E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the SauceDemo v1 e-commerce application. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSauceDemo v1 is an e-commerce application.  The core business functionality revolves around product browsing, adding items to a cart, and completing the checkout process.\n\n**Criticality:**\n\n*   **P0 (Critical):** Login, Product Listing, Add to Cart, Checkout (Payment Processing Simulation), Order Confirmation.\n*   **P1 (High):** User Profile Management, Inventory Management (from an admin perspective - if applicable), Search Functionality.\n*   **P2 (Medium):** Product Reviews, Contact Us Form, Password Reset.\n*   **P3 (Low):**  \"About\" Page, Social Media Links.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the SauceDemo application can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders leads to lost revenue.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Poor user experience due to bugs can erode customer trust.\n*   **Data Security Breach:** Vulnerabilities can expose sensitive user data.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All P0, P1, and P2 functionalities as defined above.\n*   Regression testing of existing functionality after any code changes.\n*   Security testing focusing on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).\n*   Basic performance testing (page load times, response times).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Load testing and stress testing (unless specifically requested).\n*   Mobile application testing (if applicable, and not part of the current scope).\n*   Detailed accessibility testing (WCAG compliance - unless specifically requested).\n*   Internationalization/Localization testing (unless specifically requested).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with valid credentials (standard_user/secret_sauce).\n    *   Verify product listing page loads successfully.\n    *   Verify a single product can be added to the cart.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass. Failure of any test case will result in build rejection.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will be executed to ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions in existing functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid Login attempts (incorrect username/password).\n    *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart.\n    *   Invalid input in checkout forms (e.g., missing required fields, invalid credit card numbers).\n    *   Attempting to access restricted pages without authentication.\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures during checkout (simulated).\n    *   Empty cart scenarios.\n    *   Large number of items in the cart.\n    *   Boundary testing on quantity fields (min/max values).\n\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks:\n        *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n        *   Authentication and authorization checks.\n        *   Secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., passwords).\n\n*   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n    *   Verify cart updates are reflected in the header (item count, total price).\n    *   Verify product details page displays correct information.\n    *   Verify order confirmation page displays correct order details.\n\n*   **Validation Messages:**\n    *   Verify appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs (e.g., \"Username is required\").\n    *   Verify success messages are displayed for successful actions (e.g., \"Item added to cart\").\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  Valid usernames and passwords (standard_user/secret_sauce), product names, and descriptions.  These will be stored in configuration files.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Generated data for checkout forms (e.g., first name, last name, address, postal code).  Faker libraries can be used to generate realistic data.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be managed in a centralized repository (e.g., CSV files, database).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to improve code maintainability and reusability. Each page of the application should be represented as a Page Object, encapsulating the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable before performing actions.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  If a test fails, it should be retried a certain number of times before being marked as a failure.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  `https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/` (Focus on valid and invalid login attempts).\n2.  **Product Listing Page:**  `https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/inventory.html` (Focus on product display, sorting, and filtering).\n3.  **Product Details Page:**  (Click on any product from the listing page).\n4.  **Cart Page:**  `https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/cart.html` (Focus on adding, removing, and updating items).\n5.  **Checkout Flow:** (From Cart Page, proceed to Checkout Information, Overview, and Confirmation).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Criteria:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant text is visible on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product names on the product listing page).\n    *   Elements are interactable (e.g., buttons are clickable, input fields are editable).\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n\n*   **Failure Criteria:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Incorrect data displayed on the page.\n    *   Broken links or images.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the SauceDemo v1 e-commerce application.  It will be reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in the application and the evolving needs of the business.\n"
