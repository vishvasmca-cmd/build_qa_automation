  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared by:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the SauceDemo e-commerce application (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring high-quality releases.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSauceDemo is a demonstration e-commerce application. While not a real-world production system, it simulates core e-commerce functionalities.  The most critical business functions, in order of priority, are:\n\n*   **P0: Login/Authentication:**  Users must be able to securely log in to access the application.\n*   **P1: Product Catalog Browsing:** Users must be able to view and filter products.\n*   **P1: Add to Cart:** Users must be able to add products to their shopping cart.\n*   **P1: Checkout Process:** Users must be able to complete the checkout process, including providing shipping information and payment details (simulated).\n*   **P2: Inventory Management (Simulated):** The application should accurately reflect available inventory.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the SauceDemo application, while not resulting in direct financial loss, can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Trust:**  Unreliable functionality can damage the perception of the application's quality.\n*   **Incorrect Data Handling:**  Errors in data processing (e.g., incorrect pricing, shipping calculations) can lead to user frustration.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection) could compromise user data (simulated in this demo).\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All core functionalities listed in the Domain Analysis (Login, Product Browsing, Add to Cart, Checkout).\n*   Positive and negative test scenarios for all user input fields.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).\n*   Basic security testing (OWASP Top 10 basics).\n*   Performance testing (page load times, response times for key actions).\n*   Accessibility testing (basic checks for WCAG compliance).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Mobile application testing (unless specifically requested).\n*   Advanced performance testing (e.g., load testing, stress testing).\n*   Comprehensive security penetration testing.\n*   Integration with external systems (as this is a demo application).\n*   Detailed accessibility compliance beyond basic checks.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with a valid user (e.g., `standard_user`).\n    *   Verify successful loading of the product catalog page after login.\n    *   Verify a product can be added to the cart.\n    *   Verify the cart page loads successfully.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Login:** Invalid username, invalid password, empty fields, SQL injection attempts in username/password fields.\n    *   **Checkout:** Invalid shipping information (e.g., empty fields, incorrect zip code format), invalid credit card details (format validation).\n    *   **Add to Cart:** Attempting to add out-of-stock items.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   **Concurrency:** Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n    *   **Network Failures:** Simulate network interruptions during checkout.\n    *   **Empty States:** Handling empty cart, empty product catalog (if applicable).\n    *   **Boundary Analysis:** Testing minimum and maximum quantities for product purchases.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   **OWASP Top 10 Basics:**\n        *   Input validation to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.\n        *   Ensure sensitive data (e.g., passwords) are not stored in plain text.\n        *   Verify proper session management.\n*   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n    *   Verify that changes to the cart (adding/removing items) are reflected in the header cart summary.\n    *   Verify that inventory updates are reflected in the product catalog.\n*   **Validation Messages:**\n    *   Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input (e.g., \"Username is required\", \"Invalid zip code\").\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  A set of pre-defined user accounts (e.g., `standard_user`, `locked_out_user`, `problem_user`, `performance_glitch_user`) will be used for login testing.  Product data can be considered relatively static for the purpose of this demo.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Shipping information (names, addresses, zip codes) will be dynamically generated to ensure a variety of test cases.  Credit card numbers (for format validation only) can also be dynamically generated.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.  Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common issues, such as element locators changing slightly.  This could involve using multiple locators for the same element and automatically switching to a working locator if one fails.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  Focus on testing different login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials, locked-out user, etc.).\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:**  Explore different product categories, sorting options, and filtering options.\n3.  **Product Detail Page:**  Test adding products to the cart from the product detail page.\n4.  **Cart Page:**  Test updating quantities, removing items, and proceeding to checkout.\n5.  **Checkout Pages (Information, Overview, Completion):**  Test different shipping information scenarios and payment options (simulated).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant text and elements are visible on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product names and prices on the product catalog page).\n    *   Form submissions are successful and redirect to the expected page.\n    *   Error messages are displayed correctly for invalid input.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Missing elements or incorrect text on pages.\n    *   Form submission errors.\n    *   Unexpected redirects.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the SauceDemo e-commerce application.  It will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the project.\n"
