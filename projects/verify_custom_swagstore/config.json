  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the SauceDemo e-commerce application (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/). It serves as a blueprint for all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and a high-quality user experience.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nSauceDemo is an e-commerce application. The core business functionalities revolve around product browsing, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process.  The most critical areas are:\n\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying products accurately and efficiently.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Managing items added by the user.\n*   **Checkout Process:** Securely processing orders and payments (simulated in this demo).\n*   **Login/Authentication:** Securely authenticating users.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure of the SauceDemo application can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders, resulting in lost revenue.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Poor user experience leading to customer dissatisfaction and negative reviews.\n*   **Data Security Breach:** Compromised user data (usernames, passwords, potentially payment information if it were a real system).\n*   **Loss of Trust:** Eroded confidence in the application's reliability.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **All core functionalities:** Login, Product Browsing, Adding to Cart, Checkout, Order Confirmation.\n*   **User Interface (UI) elements:** Ensuring correct display and functionality across different browsers and devices.\n*   **Data validation:** Ensuring data integrity throughout the application.\n*   **Error handling:** Graceful handling of errors and informative error messages.\n*   **Security:** Basic security checks to prevent common vulnerabilities.\n*   **Accessibility:** Basic accessibility checks to ensure usability for users with disabilities.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing, and performance optimization are not included in this initial strategy.\n*   **Advanced Security Testing:** Penetration testing and in-depth security audits are out of scope for this initial phase.\n*   **Third-Party Integrations:** Testing integrations with external services (e.g., payment gateways) is out of scope, as this is a demo application.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the application's basic functionality is working.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with valid credentials (standard_user/secret_sauce).\n    *   Verify the product catalog page loads successfully, displaying product names and prices.\n    *   Verify adding a single item to the cart.\n    *   Verify the cart page loads with the added item.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will be executed to ensure that new changes have not introduced any regressions.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid Login Attempts: Test with incorrect usernames and passwords.\n    *   Invalid Input in Checkout: Test with missing or invalid information in the checkout form.\n    *   Out-of-Stock Scenarios: Attempt to add more items to the cart than available in stock (if applicable).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Simulate multiple users accessing the application simultaneously (if possible).\n    *   Network Failures: Simulate network interruptions during critical operations (e.g., checkout).\n    *   Empty States: Verify the application handles empty states gracefully (e.g., empty cart).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input Validation: Check for basic SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into input fields.\n*   **Functional Testing:**\n    *   Verify product details page displays correctly.\n    *   Verify the ability to remove items from the cart.\n    *   Verify the checkout process completes successfully.\n    *   Verify order confirmation page displays correctly.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:** User credentials (standard_user/secret_sauce) will be stored in a configuration file.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Product names, quantities, and other relevant data will be dynamically generated or retrieved from the application.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to improve code maintainability and reusability. Each page of the application should have a corresponding Page Object class that encapsulates the page's elements and actions.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically recover from common test failures, such as element not found exceptions.  This could involve retrying the action or re-locating the element.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test. This will help to avoid flaky tests caused by timing issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  `https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/index.html` - Focus on different login attempts (valid/invalid).\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/inventory.html` - Explore product details, add items to cart.\n3.  **Shopping Cart Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/cart.html` - Explore item removal, proceed to checkout.\n4.  **Checkout Information Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/checkout-step-one.html` - Input different valid/invalid data.\n5.  **Checkout Overview Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/checkout-step-two.html` - Review order details, proceed to finish.\n6.  **Checkout Complete Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/checkout-complete.html` - Verify order confirmation.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant text is visible on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product names and prices on the product catalog page, order confirmation message on the checkout complete page).\n    *   Elements are interactable (e.g., buttons are clickable, input fields are editable).\n    *   Data is displayed correctly (e.g., product prices, quantities, order totals).\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Incorrect data display.\n    *   Broken links or images.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the SauceDemo application.\n"
