  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the SauceDemo e-commerce application (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring comprehensive coverage of critical functionalities.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSauceDemo is an e-commerce application, simulating an online store. The core business functionalities revolve around:\n\n*   **Product Catalog:** Browsing and viewing products.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and modifying items.\n*   **Checkout Process:** Entering shipping information, selecting payment methods, and confirming orders.\n*   **User Authentication:** Login and logout functionality.\n\nGiven the e-commerce nature, the **Checkout Process** is considered **P0 (Priority 0)**, as failure in this area directly impacts revenue. User Authentication is also high priority as it gates access to the application.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the SauceDemo application can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders, resulting in lost revenue.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised user data (e.g., login credentials, shipping addresses) leading to legal and reputational damage.\n*   **Loss of Trust:** Negative user experience leading to customer churn and brand damage.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to product browsing, adding to cart, checkout, user authentication, and order management.\n*   Functional testing of all user interface elements and their interactions.\n*   Negative testing to validate error handling and input validation.\n*   Security testing to identify vulnerabilities.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Performance testing of critical workflows (e.g., page load times, checkout process).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed performance testing beyond basic page load times.\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Localization testing (testing for different languages/regions).\n*   API testing (unless directly related to UI functionality).\n*   Mobile application testing (if applicable, and not part of this project).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with valid credentials (standard\\_user/secret\\_sauce).\n    *   Verify the main product page loads successfully after login.\n    *   Verify a product can be added to the cart.\n    *   Verify the cart page loads successfully.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass. Failure of any test case will result in build rejection.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will be executed to ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions and that existing functionality remains intact.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts (e.g., incorrect username/password, empty fields).\n    *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart.\n    *   Entering invalid shipping information (e.g., incorrect postal code).\n    *   Submitting the checkout form with missing required fields.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Adding a large number of items to the cart.\n    *   Simultaneous access to the application by multiple users (concurrency).\n    *   Simulating network failures during the checkout process.\n    *   Handling empty states (e.g., empty cart, no products found).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  Specifically, check all input fields for malicious characters and code.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Test Data:** Use a set of predefined user accounts (e.g., standard\\_user, locked\\_out\\_user, problem\\_user, performance\\_glitch\\_user) with known credentials and roles.\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data:** Generate dynamic data for fields like shipping addresses and order details to avoid conflicts and ensure uniqueness. Use libraries like Faker to generate realistic data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a separate class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n    *   Each page class should contain:\n        *   Locators for all relevant UI elements (e.g., buttons, input fields, labels).\n        *   Methods for interacting with those elements (e.g., click, type, get text).\n*   **Test Framework:**  Recommend using a robust and widely adopted testing framework such as Selenium WebDriver with JUnit or TestNG for test execution and reporting.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met (e.g., element to be visible, clickable) before proceeding with the test.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically recover from common test failures, such as element not found errors. This can involve retrying the action, refreshing the page, or logging in again.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/) - Focus on different user credentials and error messages.\n2.  **Product Inventory Page:** (Accessed after successful login) - Explore product details, add to cart functionality.\n3.  **Shopping Cart Page:** (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/cart.html) - Explore quantity adjustments, remove items.\n4.  **Checkout Information Page:** (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/checkout-step-one.html) - Focus on different input combinations for shipping information.\n5.  **Checkout Overview Page:** (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/checkout-step-two.html) - Verify order summary and total price.\n6.  **Checkout Completion Page:** (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/checkout-complete.html) - Verify successful order placement.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Criteria:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant text and UI elements are visible on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product names and prices on the product page).\n    *   Expected data is displayed correctly (e.g., correct order total on the checkout overview page).\n*   **Failure Criteria:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected error messages or exceptions.\n    *   Incorrect data or UI elements.\n    *   Broken links or images.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.\n"
