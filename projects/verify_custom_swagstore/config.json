  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo v1 Regression Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n**Domain Analysis:** SauceDemo v1, while a demo application, simulates an e-commerce experience.  Key areas include login, product catalog, cart management, and checkout. Failure in any of these areas directly impacts the simulated user experience and could indicate deeper underlying issues if this was a real e-commerce site.\n\n**Risk Profile:**  Since this is a demo application, the direct financial risk is minimal. However, a failing test suite, especially regression, could indicate instability in the code base, leading to potential future failures in a live, revenue-generating application.  The primary risk is *developer trust* \u2013 a consistently failing or unstable test suite will be ignored.\n\n**Testing Scope:**\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Login functionality (positive and negative scenarios)\n    *   Product catalog display and filtering\n    *   Add to cart functionality\n    *   Cart management (add, remove, update quantities)\n    *   Checkout process (all steps, including form validation)\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (at least Chrome, Firefox, and Safari)\n    *   Responsive design (testing on various screen sizes)\n    *   Error handling (invalid inputs, out-of-stock scenarios)\n    *   Basic security checks (input validation)\n    *   Logout functionality\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance) \u2013 can be considered separately after core functionality is stable\n    *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning)\n    *   API testing (unless specifically required)\n    *   Detailed UI/UX testing beyond basic functionality (e.g., A/B testing different layouts)\n    *   Integration with external services (payment gateways, shipping providers)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n**Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n*   Purpose: Validate basic system health after deployment or code changes.\n*   Test Cases:\n    1.  Navigate to the login page.\n    2.  Login with `standard_user` and `secret_sauce`.\n    3.  Verify successful login and navigation to the product catalog page.\n*   Failure Criteria: If any of these steps fail, the build is considered broken and requires immediate investigation.\n\n**Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n\n*   Goal:  Ensure existing functionality remains intact after code changes.\n*   Categorization:  Tests should be categorized by functional area (e.g., \"Login\", \"Product Catalog\", \"Cart\", \"Checkout\") for easier maintenance and reporting.\n\n    *   **Login Functionality:**\n        *   Positive Login:  Valid credentials (`standard_user`, `secret_sauce`).\n        *   Negative Login:\n            *   Invalid username.\n            *   Invalid password.\n            *   Locked out user (`locked_out_user`).\n            *   Empty username and password fields.\n        *   Boundary Cases: Extremely long username/password strings (within reasonable limits).\n    *   **Product Catalog:**\n        *   Verify product display (name, description, price, image).\n        *   Filtering/Sorting:  Test various sorting options (e.g., price low to high, name A to Z).\n        *   Add to Cart: Add products to the cart from the catalog.\n    *   **Cart Management:**\n        *   Add multiple products.\n        *   Remove products.\n        *   Update product quantities (positive and negative scenarios \u2013 e.g., entering 0 or a negative quantity).\n        *   Verify cart total calculation.\n    *   **Checkout Process:**\n        *   Navigate to the checkout page.\n        *   Enter valid shipping information.\n        *   Complete the checkout process.\n        *   Validate the confirmation message/page.\n        *   Negative Testing:\n            *   Missing shipping information (first name, last name, postal code).\n            *   Invalid shipping information (e.g., special characters in name).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency:  Simultaneous add-to-cart actions from multiple users (if applicable to the application architecture).\n        *   Network Failures: Simulate network interruptions during critical operations (e.g., during checkout).  Ensure appropriate error handling.\n        *   Empty States: Verify handling of empty states (e.g., empty cart).\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Input Validation:  Basic checks for SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in input fields (login, shipping information).  Test with common exploit strings.\n        *   Ensure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card information \u2013 if applicable) is not exposed in the UI or console logs.\n\n**Data Strategy:**\n\n*   **Static Data:**  Use predefined test data for core functionality (e.g., the `standard_user` credentials).\n*   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Generate dynamic data for scenarios requiring unique inputs (e.g., generating random shipping addresses).  Consider using libraries like Faker.js.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n**Framework Recommendation:**\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page/section of the application as a class. This improves code maintainability, readability, and reusability.  Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n\n**Resilience Strategy:**\n\n*   **Polling Assertions (Retry Logic):**  Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and potential timing issues.  Instead of immediately failing an assertion, retry it for a reasonable amount of time.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common issues.  For example:\n    *   If an element is not found, refresh the page and try again.\n    *   If a modal dialog appears unexpectedly, automatically close it.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Favor explicit waits (`WebDriverWait`) over implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.  This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues.\n*   **Test Data Management:**  Implement a robust test data management strategy to prevent test failures due to data inconsistencies.  This may involve creating and cleaning up test data before and after each test.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n**Mining Targets (Priority Order for Autonomous Exploration):**\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  All login scenarios (positive and negative)\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:**  Adding products to the cart.\n3.  **Cart Page:**  Modifying quantities, removing items.\n4.  **Checkout Page:**  Entering shipping information and completing the checkout process.\n\n**Verification Criteria:**\n\n*   **General:**\n    *   HTTP Status Code 200 (OK) for all page requests.\n    *   No JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n*   **Specific:**\n    *   Login: \"Welcome\" message or successful navigation to the product catalog page.\n    *   Product Catalog:  Products are displayed correctly (name, description, price).\n    *   Cart: Cart total is calculated correctly.  Products are added/removed as expected.\n    *   Checkout:  Confirmation message/page is displayed after successful checkout."
