  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo v1 E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the SauceDemo v1 e-commerce application, focusing on regression testing. It provides a comprehensive plan for ensuring the quality and stability of the application, covering risk assessment, testing scope, architecture guidance, and execution instructions. This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable automated testing framework.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSauceDemo v1 is an e-commerce application. The core business functionalities include:\n\n*   **Login:** User authentication and access control.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying and browsing available products.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and managing selected products.\n*   **Checkout:** Processing orders, including shipping and payment information.\n*   **Order Confirmation:** Providing order details and confirmation to the user.\n\nGiven the e-commerce nature, the **Checkout process is considered P0 (Priority 0)**, as failure in this area directly impacts revenue. Login is P1, as without it, no other functionality can be tested.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the SauceDemo application can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders, resulting in lost revenue.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised user data (e.g., login credentials, payment information).\n*   **Loss of Trust:** Negative impact on brand reputation due to poor user experience and security vulnerabilities.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user login, product catalog browsing, shopping cart management, checkout process, and order confirmation.\n*   Negative testing scenarios for all input fields (e.g., invalid login credentials, incorrect payment information).\n*   Edge cases related to concurrency, network failures, and empty states.\n*   Security testing for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Responsive design testing (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, and endurance testing).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Detailed API testing (beyond basic integration checks).\n*   Localization testing (if not explicitly required).\n*   Third-party integrations (beyond basic functionality checks).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will serve as a minimal health check to verify the application's core functionality after each build.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with valid credentials (standard\\_user/secret\\_sauce).\n    *   Verify the product catalog page loads successfully.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All smoke tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality, ensuring that recent changes have not introduced any regressions.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts with incorrect usernames and passwords.\n    *   Invalid input in checkout forms (e.g., missing required fields, incorrect credit card numbers).\n    *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrent user access to the same product or cart.\n    *   Simulating network failures during checkout.\n    *   Handling empty cart scenarios.\n    *   Testing with large quantities of items in the cart.\n*   **Security Testing:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  Specifically, test all input fields with potentially malicious strings.\n*   **Functional Testing:**\n    *   Adding products to the cart.\n    *   Removing products from the cart.\n    *   Updating product quantities in the cart.\n    *   Proceeding to checkout with valid shipping and payment information.\n    *   Verifying order confirmation details.\n    *   Testing different payment methods (if available).\n*   **Cross-Browser Testing:**\n    *   Execute regression tests on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers.\n*   **Responsive Design Testing:**\n    *   Verify the application's layout and functionality on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined user credentials (e.g., standard\\_user/secret\\_sauce) and product information.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generated data for checkout forms (e.g., random names, addresses, credit card numbers).  Consider using a library like Faker.js for generating realistic data.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a separate configuration file or database to ensure easy maintenance and updates.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a separate class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Test Framework:**  Recommend using a popular testing framework like Selenium WebDriver with JUnit or TestNG for test execution and reporting.\n*   **Assertion Library:** Use a robust assertion library like AssertJ for clear and concise test assertions.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.  Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures, such as element not found exceptions.  This could involve retrying the action or refreshing the page.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests to account for flaky tests due to environment issues or temporary network problems.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/` - Focus on valid and invalid login attempts.\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:** `/inventory.html` (after successful login) - Focus on product listing, sorting, and filtering.\n3.  **Product Details Page:** (Clicking on a product) - Focus on product description, image, and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n4.  **Shopping Cart Page:** `/cart.html` - Focus on adding, removing, and updating product quantities.\n5.  **Checkout Pages:** `/checkout-step-one.html`, `/checkout-step-two.html`, `/checkout-complete.html` - Focus on filling out shipping and payment information, reviewing the order, and completing the checkout process.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Criteria:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant page titles and headings are visible (e.g., \"Products\" on the product catalog page, \"Checkout: Overview\" on the checkout overview page).\n    *   Specific elements are present and interactable (e.g., \"Add to Cart\" buttons, checkout form fields).\n    *   Successful login redirects to the product catalog page.\n    *   Successful checkout displays the order confirmation page.\n*   **Failure Criteria:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected exceptions or errors during test execution.\n    *   Incorrect data displayed on the page.\n    *   Broken links or images.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities detected.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust and reliable automated testing framework for the SauceDemo v1 e-commerce application. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the quality and stability of the application, minimizing risks and maximizing user satisfaction.\n"
