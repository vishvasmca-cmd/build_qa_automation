  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the SauceDemo application (https://www.saucedemo.com/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSauceDemo is a demo e-commerce application. While not a real-world e-commerce platform, it simulates critical functionalities such as login, product browsing, adding items to the cart, and checkout.  The most critical business functions, even in a demo context, are:\n\n*   **Login:** Access to the application.\n*   **Product Browsing:** Viewing available products.\n*   **Add to Cart:** Selecting products for purchase.\n*   **Checkout:** Completing the purchase process.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the SauceDemo application, while not directly impacting real-world financial transactions, can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Confidence:**  If the application is used for training or demonstration purposes, failures can erode confidence in the underlying technology or processes.\n*   **Reputational Damage:**  If the application is publicly accessible and frequently fails, it can negatively impact the perception of the organization providing it.\n*   **Blocked Demos/Training:** Critical failures can halt training sessions or product demonstrations.\n\nTherefore, a robust testing strategy is crucial to ensure the application's stability and reliability.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user login, product browsing, adding items to the cart, checkout process (including information input and confirmation), and order completion.\n*   Positive and negative test scenarios for all in-scope functionalities.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Basic security testing (input validation, XSS prevention).\n*   Performance testing (page load times, response times).\n*   Accessibility testing (basic WCAG compliance).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed performance testing (load testing, stress testing).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n*   Mobile application testing (if applicable).\n*   Integration with external systems (if any).\n*   Detailed accessibility testing beyond basic WCAG compliance.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is working as expected.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with a valid user (\"standard_user\" and \"secret_sauce\").\n    *   Verify successful loading of the inventory page after login.\n    *   Verify that at least one product can be added to the cart.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All smoke tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect username, incorrect password, locked-out user).\n    *   Invalid input during checkout (e.g., missing first name, invalid zip code).\n    *   Attempting to add more items to the cart than available in stock (if applicable).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Adding a large number of items to the cart.\n    *   Navigating the application with a slow internet connection.\n    *   Handling session timeouts.\n    *   Testing with different browser versions and operating systems.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input validation to prevent XSS attacks (e.g., entering malicious scripts in input fields).\n    *   Checking for SQL injection vulnerabilities (e.g., entering SQL code in input fields).\n*   **Functional Testing:**\n    *   Verify product details are displayed correctly.\n    *   Verify the cart updates correctly when adding or removing items.\n    *   Verify the checkout process completes successfully.\n    *   Verify order confirmation is displayed after checkout.\n*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**\n    *   Execute regression tests on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.\n*   **Accessibility Testing:**\n    *   Verify basic WCAG compliance (e.g., proper use of ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  Valid usernames and passwords (e.g., \"standard_user\" and \"secret_sauce\") will be stored in a configuration file.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Randomly generated data (e.g., first name, last name, zip code) will be used for checkout to ensure data uniqueness and prevent conflicts.  Faker libraries can be used for this purpose.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to improve code maintainability and reusability. Each page of the application should be represented by a Page Object class, which encapsulates the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically recover from common test failures, such as element not found errors. This can involve retrying the action or re-locating the element.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  Focus on different login scenarios (valid credentials, invalid credentials, locked-out user).\n2.  **Inventory Page:**  Explore product details, add items to the cart.\n3.  **Cart Page:**  Verify cart functionality (update quantity, remove items).\n4.  **Checkout Pages:**  Thoroughly explore the checkout process, including information input and confirmation.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected text and elements are visible on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product names on the inventory page).\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n    *   Elements are interactable (e.g., buttons are clickable, input fields are editable).\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Missing or incorrect elements.\n    *   JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n    *   Inability to interact with elements.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure it remains relevant and effective.\n"
