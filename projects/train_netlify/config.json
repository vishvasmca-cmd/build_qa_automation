  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: Netlify Smoke Suite\n\n## 1. Domain Information\n\n**Target URL:** https://www.netlify.com\n\n**Business Domain:** SaaS (Software as a Service) - specifically targeting developers and businesses looking for a platform to build, deploy, and scale web applications.\n\n**Analysis:** Netlify is a platform designed to streamline the web development workflow. Key aspects include:\n\n*   **Focus:** JAMstack architecture (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup).\n*   **Core Services:** Continuous deployment, serverless functions, edge networking, and collaborative tools.\n*   **Target Audience:** Web developers, front-end engineers, and digital agencies.\n*   **Business Goals:** Attracting new users, retaining existing customers, and upselling features.\n*   **Potential Risks:** Downtime directly impacts user deployments, broken features can hinder developer workflows, and security vulnerabilities could compromise user data.\n\n## 2. Smoke Suite Definition\n\n**Objective:** Verify the core functionality of the Netlify website, ensuring it is operational and users can access critical features.\n\n**Scope:**\n\n*   Website availability and basic functionality.\n*   Core navigation and key landing pages.\n*   A critical user flow: navigating to the homepage, verifying a key element (hero headline), and initiating the signup process.\n\n**Test Cases:**\n\n### 2.1 Website Availability\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Description:** Verify the Netlify homepage is accessible and returns a successful HTTP status code (200).\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.netlify.com\n    2.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200.\n*   **Expected Result:** The homepage loads successfully and the HTTP status code is 200.\n\n### 2.2 Core Navigation\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Description:** Verify the primary navigation links on the homepage are functional.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.netlify.com\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu.\n    3.  Click on the following links and verify they navigate to the correct pages:\n        *   \"Platform\"\n        *   \"Pricing\"\n        *   \"Docs\"\n        *   \"Blog\"\n*   **Expected Result:** Each navigation link redirects to the corresponding page without errors.\n\n### 2.3 Core Flow: Homepage & Get Started\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Description:** Verify the core \"Happy Path\" of landing on the homepage, seeing the hero headline, and clicking 'Get Started'\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.netlify.com\n    2.  Verify the hero headline contains the text \"The platform for modern web projects\".\n    3.  Locate the \"Get Started\" button (use `getByRole('button', {name: /Get Started/i})` if necessary).\n    4.  Click the \"Get Started\" button.\n    5.  Verify that clicking the button navigates the user to the sign-up page.\n*   **Expected Result:** The headline text matches the expected value, the \"Get Started\" button is clickable, and the user is redirected to the sign-up page.\n\n## 3. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agents on what elements and pages to prioritize during mining.  This is crucial for expanding the test suite beyond the initial smoke tests.\n\n**Prioritized Elements/Pages:**\n\n1.  **Homepage Hero Section:**\n    *   **Reason:** First impression, conveys core value proposition.\n    *   **Mining Instructions:** Extract all text elements (headings, paragraphs, links) and images. Identify all calls to action (CTAs) and their target URLs.\n2.  **Pricing Page:**\n    *   **Reason:** Critical for understanding the business model and potential revenue streams.\n    *   **Mining Instructions:** Extract pricing tiers, feature comparisons, and any interactive elements (e.g., cost calculators). Focus on links to \"Start Free Trial\" or \"Contact Sales.\"\n3.  **Documentation (Docs) Section:**\n    *   **Reason:** Essential for user onboarding and technical understanding.\n    *   **Mining Instructions:** Explore the main landing page for the documentation. Identify key sections like \"Quick Start,\" \"API Reference,\" and \"Tutorials.\" Prioritize links to code examples and configuration guides.\n4.  **Blog:**\n     *  **Reason:** Keep up to date on changes.\n     *  **Mining Instructions:** Look at Blog posts. Find categories.\n5.  **\"Platform\" Dropdown:**\n    *   **Reason:** Exposes the different sub-products.\n    *   **Mining Instructions:** Get a list of sub-products.\n\n**Data Extraction Strategy:**\n\n*   **Prioritize text-based content:** Headlines, descriptions, error messages, form labels.\n*   **Identify and extract all links (<a> tags):**  Capture the `href` attribute and link text.\n*   **Analyze form elements (<form>):**  Identify input fields (text, email, password), dropdowns, checkboxes, and submit buttons.\n*   **Capture image URLs (<img> tags):** Verify image alt text for accessibility.\n*   **Look for dynamic content:**  Elements that change based on user interaction or data updates (e.g., progress bars, status indicators).\n\n**Test Suite Expansion Guidance:**\n\n*   **Based on Mining Results:**  Create new test cases to verify the functionality of mined elements and pages. For example, if a new feature is highlighted on the homepage, create a test case to verify its functionality.\n*   **Focus on User Flows:**  Extend the \"Happy Path\" test case to cover more complex user scenarios (e.g., creating an account, deploying a website, configuring DNS settings).\n*   **Consider Edge Cases:**  Identify potential error conditions and create test cases to verify error handling (e.g., invalid form input, network errors).\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for building a comprehensive test suite for Netlify. The Smoke Suite ensures basic functionality, while the Strategic Mining Instructions guide the autonomous agents to discover and test more complex features and user flows."
