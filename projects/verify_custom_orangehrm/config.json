  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM PIM Module\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for ensuring the quality and reliability of the OrangeHRM application, specifically focusing on the PIM (Personnel Information Management) module. This strategy serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team and guides all testing activities.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Application**: OrangeHRM (opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)\n*   **Business Domain**: Human Resources Management (HRM)\n*   **Business Criticality**: High. HRM systems manage employee data, payroll, and compliance, all of which are critical to business operations.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failure of the PIM module can lead to data breaches, payroll errors, compliance violations, and loss of employee trust.\n\n**Testing Scope:**\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Login functionality with valid and invalid credentials.\n    *   Navigation to and functionality of the PIM module.\n    *   All features within the PIM module:\n        *   Adding new employee records.\n        *   Searching and filtering employee records.\n        *   Viewing and editing employee details.\n        *   Managing employee contact information.\n        *   Managing employee emergency contacts.\n        *   Managing employee dependents.\n        *   Data import and export functionality.\n        *   Report generation.\n    *   Security testing related to data access and modification within the PIM module.\n    *   User interface and usability testing.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).\n    *   Responsiveness on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Other modules within OrangeHRM besides PIM (e.g., Leave, Time).\n    *   Performance testing (load, stress, soak).  *Note:* We may introduce some basic performance checks later but they're not the priority here.\n    *   Integration with external systems (e.g., payroll systems) \u2013 unless specifically required by a user story.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n**A. Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n*   **Goal:** Verify the system is up and running and the core functionality is accessible.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to the login page.\n    2.  Login with valid \"Admin/admin123\" credentials.\n    3.  Verify successful login and redirection to the dashboard.\n    4.  Navigate to the PIM module.\n    5.  Verify the PIM module page loads successfully.\n\n**B. Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n\n*   **General Principles:** All new features and bug fixes will trigger a full regression test of the PIM module.\n*   **Test Areas:**\n    1.  **Login:**\n        *   Valid credentials (Admin/admin123).\n        *   Invalid username.\n        *   Invalid password.\n        *   Case-sensitive username/password.\n        *   Account lockout after multiple failed attempts.\n    2.  **Employee Management (Add/Edit/Delete):**\n        *   Adding a new employee with all required fields.\n        *   Adding a new employee with optional fields only.\n        *   Adding a new employee with invalid data (e.g., special characters in name, invalid email).\n        *   Editing existing employee information.\n        *   Deleting an employee record (with confirmation).\n        *   Verifying data persistence after adding/editing.\n        *   Testing character limits on all fields.\n        *   Testing with Unicode characters.\n    3.  **Search and Filtering:**\n        *   Searching by employee name.\n        *   Searching by employee ID.\n        *   Searching by other relevant fields (e.g., job title, location).\n        *   Filtering by various criteria (e.g., employment status, department).\n        *   Testing with partial search terms.\n        *   Testing with no matching results.\n    4.  **Data Import/Export:**\n        *   Importing employee data from a CSV file with valid data.\n        *   Importing employee data from a CSV file with invalid data (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types).\n        *   Exporting employee data to a CSV file.\n        *   Verifying data integrity after import/export.\n    5.  **Reports:**\n        *   Generating various reports (e.g., employee list, employee demographics).\n        *   Verifying the accuracy of data in the reports.\n        *   Testing report filtering and sorting options.\n    6.  **Security:**\n        *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on all input fields (SQL Injection, XSS).  Specifically, sanitize all inputs and check for proper encoding.\n        *   Role-based access control (ensure users only have access to authorized data).\n        *   Data encryption at rest and in transit.\n        *   Password complexity requirements.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Attempting to add an employee with missing required fields.\n    *   Attempting to add an employee with invalid data types.\n    *   Attempting to delete an employee that is referenced in other modules.\n    *   Attempting to access the PIM module without proper authorization.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Handling large datasets (thousands of employees).\n    *   Concurrent user access (multiple users adding/editing employees simultaneously).\n    *   Network failures during data import/export.\n    *   Empty states (e.g., no employees found after a search).\n\n**C. Data Strategy:**\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Pre-defined employee records with various characteristics will be used for core functionality testing.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Data will be generated on-the-fly for negative testing, edge cases, and volume testing.  Faker libraries are recommended.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a separate database or CSV files to avoid affecting production data.  The test data must be version controlled.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM). This will improve test maintainability and readability. Each page in the OrangeHRM application (e.g., Login Page, PIM Module Page, Add Employee Page) will have its corresponding Page Object class.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle dynamically loading elements and asynchronous operations. Avoid hard-coded waits.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically retry failed actions (e.g., clicking a button that is temporarily unavailable).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Use a retry mechanism for failing tests due to intermittent issues. Limited to a small number of retries (e.g. 2-3).\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits rather than implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Locator Strategy:** Prefer robust locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `data-qa`) over brittle locators (e.g., XPath based on page structure).  Work with development to add these locators.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Prioritized Order):**\n    1.  **Login Page:** Essential for accessing the PIM module.\n    2.  **PIM Module Page:** Core page for managing employee information.\n    3.  **Add Employee Page:** Critical for adding new employee records.\n    4.  **Edit Employee Page:**  Critical for modifying existing employee records.\n    5.  **Search Functionality:** Crucial for locating specific employees.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria (Success Definitions):**\n    *   **Login Success:** HTTP 200 OK response, redirection to the dashboard, and the presence of a \"Welcome\" message with the user's name.\n    *   **PIM Module Page Load:** HTTP 200 OK response and the presence of the \"Add\" button for adding new employees.\n    *   **Add Employee Success:** HTTP 200 OK response, successful creation of the employee record, and confirmation message displayed on the screen.\n    *   **Edit Employee Success:** HTTP 200 OK response, successful modification of the employee record, and confirmation message displayed on the screen.\n    *   **Search Success:** HTTP 200 OK response, and the correct employee record(s) are displayed based on the search criteria.  Ensure the correct count matches the search results.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be continuously reviewed and updated as the OrangeHRM application evolves and new requirements emerge."
