  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: LetCode.in Regression Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis:\n\nLetCode.in is a website providing coding challenges and practice exercises. While not directly revenue-generating, its criticality lies in its role as a learning platform for developers. Failure can lead to a negative user experience, impacting learning and potentially damaging the platform's reputation. The \"Input\" and \"Practice Form Filling\" functionality is a core component of the learning experience.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile:\n\n*   **Financial Risk:** Low (no direct revenue impact).\n*   **Reputational Risk:** Medium (negative user experience, loss of trust).\n*   **Data Security Risk:** Low (primarily user input data, potential XSS vulnerabilities).\n*   **Operational Risk:** Medium (inability to practice coding skills).\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope:\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   All elements and functionalities within the \"Input\" and \"Practice Form Filling\" section of LetCode.in.\n    *   Input validation and error handling.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n    *   Basic security checks (input sanitization).\n    *   Accessibility (basic ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation).\n    *   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Performance testing (load, stress).\n    *   Advanced security penetration testing.\n    *   Testing of other sections of LetCode.in outside the \"Input\" and \"Practice Form Filling\" area.\n    *   Third-party integrations (if any).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity):\n\n*   **Objective:** Verify basic functionality of the \"Input\" and \"Practice Form Filling\" section.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://letcode.in/test`.\n    2.  Click on the \"Input\" link.\n    3.  Verify the \"Input\" page loads successfully (HTTP 200, page title contains \"Input\").\n    4.  Verify at least one input field is visible on the page.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Failure Criteria:** Any test failure will block the build.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive):\n\n*   **Objective:** Thoroughly test all aspects of the \"Input\" and \"Practice Form Filling\" functionality, ensuring no regressions are introduced.\n*   **Test Areas:**\n    *   **Input Field Validation:**\n        *   **Negative Testing:**\n            *   Invalid data types (e.g., entering text in a numeric field).\n            *   Boundary values (e.g., minimum/maximum length).\n            *   Special characters and potentially malicious input (XSS).\n            *   Empty input fields.\n        *   **Positive Testing:**\n            *   Valid data types and formats.\n            *   Acceptance of expected characters and symbols.\n    *   **Form Submission:**\n        *   Successful submission with valid data.\n        *   Error handling for incomplete or invalid data.\n        *   Verification of data persistence (if applicable).\n    *   **UI/UX:**\n        *   Correct display of input fields and labels.\n        *   Proper alignment and spacing.\n        *   Responsiveness across different screen sizes.\n        *   Accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency (multiple users accessing the form simultaneously).\n        *   Network failures during form submission.\n        *   Browser-specific rendering issues.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Utilize dynamic data generation for input fields to avoid data duplication and ensure test coverage. Consider using libraries like Faker.js.\n    *   **Data Pools:** Create data pools for specific input types (e.g., valid email addresses, phone numbers) to ensure consistency and reusability.\n    *   **Security Data:** Maintain a separate data pool for security-related test cases (e.g., XSS payloads).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation:\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page or section of the application as a separate class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and reduces code duplication.\n    *   Create separate Page Objects for the \"Input\" page and any related components.\n    *   Each Page Object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met (e.g., element to be visible, clickable) before proceeding with the test.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures (e.g., retrying failed assertions, re-locating elements).\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests, allowing them to be re-executed a certain number of times before failing.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets:\n\n1.  **Input Page:** `https://letcode.in/test` -> Click \"Input\". Focus on all input fields, buttons, and associated labels.\n2.  **Practice Form Filling Page:** (If available from the Input page, otherwise provide the direct URL). Focus on all form elements, including text fields, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit buttons.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria:\n\n*   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 status code.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Verify that all expected elements are visible on the page.\n*   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text elements (e.g., labels, error messages) are displayed correctly.\n*   **Form Submission Success:** Verify that form submissions are successful and that the expected results are displayed (e.g., success message, data persistence).\n*   **Error Message Validation:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input.\n*   **Accessibility Checks:** Verify basic accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the \"Input\" and \"Practice Form Filling\" functionality of LetCode.in. It emphasizes risk assessment, a well-defined testing strategy, architectural guidance, and clear execution instructions. This document will be continuously reviewed and updated as the project evolves.\n"
