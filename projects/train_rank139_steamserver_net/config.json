  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Smoke Testing for Steamserver.net\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Steamserver.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Steamserver.net appears to be a website potentially related to game servers or related services. While not explicitly e-commerce, availability and basic functionality are crucial for user engagement and potential revenue generation (e.g., server hosting, game sales).\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities (website launch, navigation, account creation) can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Potential Users:** Inability to access the site or create accounts directly impacts user acquisition.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** A non-functional website creates a negative first impression.\n    *   **Lost Revenue Opportunities:** If the site offers services, downtime translates to lost income.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website accessibility and load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (buttons, links, menus).\n        *   Basic navigation to critical pages (Login, Signup/Get Started, etc.).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual features.\n        *   Negative testing (invalid inputs, error handling).\n        *   Performance testing (load times, scalability).\n        *   Database interactions.\n        *   Third-party integrations.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health and accessibility of the Steamserver.net website.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully in a browser.\n    2.  **UI Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n        *   Login button/link\n        *   Signup/Get Started button/link\n        *   \"Try for Free\" or similar call-to-action button/link (if present)\n        *   Two additional buttons/links (any prominent buttons/links on the homepage)\n        *   Two menu bars (verify presence, not functionality)\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. A full regression strategy will be defined separately.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence and website accessibility.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** While a full-fledged framework might be overkill for a simple smoke test, a basic Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended for maintainability and future expansion.\n    *   **BasePage:** A base class containing common functionalities like browser initialization and navigation.\n    *   **HomePage:** A page object representing the Steamserver.net homepage, with methods to identify the required UI elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays and ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them. This helps mitigate flakiness.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for website launch to handle temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: The primary target for verifying website accessibility and UI element presence.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code AND the page title contains \"Steamserver\" (or a relevant keyword).\n    2.  **UI Element Identification:** Each specified button/link/menu bar is present on the page and visible (using appropriate element selection techniques)."
