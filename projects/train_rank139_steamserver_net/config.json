  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Steamserver.net - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for smoke testing the Steamserver.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated smoke tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Steamserver.net appears to be a website related to server hosting, potentially for gaming or other applications. The business criticality is moderate; downtime or failures could lead to customer dissatisfaction and potential revenue loss.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Service outages could prevent users from accessing or managing their servers, leading to potential refunds or lost revenue.\n    *   **Trust Loss:** Frequent outages or website instability could erode user trust and lead to customer churn.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative reviews and social media mentions could impact the website's reputation and ability to attract new customers.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, 5 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic functionality (e.g., buttons are clickable, links are navigable).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of server hosting services.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Database interactions.\n        *   Error handling and negative testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully in a browser.\n        2.  **Login Element:** Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present and clickable.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Element:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"GetStarted\" button/link is present and clickable.\n        4.  **Button Identification (5):** Identify and verify the presence of 5 additional buttons on the homepage.\n        5.  **Link Identification (2):** Identify and verify the presence of 2 links on the homepage.\n        6.  **Menu Bar Identification (2):** Identify and verify the presence of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for smoke testing, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   This will be defined in a separate Regression Test Strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For smoke tests, static data is sufficient. No need for dynamic data generation.\n    *   Consider using environment variables for the base URL to easily switch between environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create separate page objects for each major section of the website (e.g., HomePage, LoginPage). This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Language:** Choose a language with strong web automation libraries (e.g., Python with Selenium, JavaScript with Playwright).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_for_element_to_be_visible`) to handle potential timing issues during page load.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., retry a test 2-3 times before marking it as failed).\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: Focus on identifying the Login, Signup/GetStarted buttons/links, 5 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified elements are present in the DOM (Document Object Model) and are visible.\n    *   **Element Clickability:** The Login and Signup/GetStarted buttons/links are clickable (no errors thrown).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate clear and concise test reports indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots or videos for failed tests to aid in debugging.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the Steamserver.net website. It will be reviewed and updated as needed to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the project."
