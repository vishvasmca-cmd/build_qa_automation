Introduction\n\nThis Master Test Plan outlines the strategy for creating a smoke test suite for the Sauce Labs website (https://saucelabs.com).  Sauce Labs is a SaaS provider offering cloud-based testing solutions. The smoke tests will verify the core functionality and ensure the website is operational and ready for further, more in-depth testing. This plan will guide the autonomous agents in mining the relevant elements, crafting assertions, and structuring the test suite.\n\n## 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://saucelabs.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Software Testing as a Service (STaaS) / SaaS\n*   **Target Audience:** Software Developers, QA Engineers, Test Automation Engineers, DevOps Engineers, and Managers involved in software testing.\n*   **Business Goals (Inferred):**\n    *   Acquire new customers seeking cloud-based testing solutions.\n    *   Showcase the features and benefits of Sauce Labs platform.\n    *   Provide resources and support to existing customers.\n*   **Key Website Areas:**\n    *   Homepage: First impression, highlights key features.\n    *   Product Pages: Details specific testing solutions (e.g., Live Testing, Automated Testing, Mobile Testing).\n    *   Pricing Page: Outlines subscription plans and costs.\n    *   Resources Section: Documentation, tutorials, blog posts, webinars.\n    *   Login/Signup Pages: Access to the Sauce Labs platform.\n    *   Integrations: Showcases integrations with popular CI/CD tools.\n\n## 3. Smoke Test Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke test suite will focus on verifying the core functionality and critical user journeys of the Sauce Labs website. The tests will be designed to be quick and easy to execute, providing a rapid assessment of the website's health.\n\n### 3.1. Smoke Suite Objectives\n\n*   Verify that the website is accessible and responsive.\n*   Ensure that the core navigation links are functional.\n*   Validate a crucial user flow - navigating the homepage and attempting to start a free trial.\n\n### 3.2. Test Cases\n\n#### 3.2.1. Website Availability\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the Sauce Labs homepage is accessible.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://saucelabs.com\n*   **Expected Result:** The Sauce Labs homepage should load successfully with HTTP status code 200.\n*   **Priority:** Critical\n\n#### 3.2.2. Core Navigation\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the main menu navigation links are working.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://saucelabs.com\n    2.  Locate the main menu (e.g., using `nav` or `ul` tag with appropriate IDs/Classes).\n    3.  Iterate through each top-level menu item (e.g., \"Platform\", \"Solutions\", \"Pricing\", \"Resources\").\n    4.  Click on each menu item.\n*   **Expected Result:** Each menu item should navigate to the corresponding page without errors.  Verify the URL changes and the new page loads.\n*   **Priority:** High\n\n#### 3.2.3. Core Flow - Homepage to \"Get Started\"\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the user can navigate to the Sauce Labs homepage, verify the hero headline, and click the \"Get Started\" button.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://saucelabs.com\n    2.  Verify that the hero headline contains the text \"Test automation at scale\".\n    3.  Locate the \"Get Started\" button (look for elements with text \"Get Started\", \"Free Trial\", or similar CTA).\n    4.  Click the \"Get Started\" button.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The hero headline contains the expected text.\n    *   The \"Get Started\" button is clickable.\n    *   Clicking the button redirects the user to a signup or contact form page (e.g., a free trial signup page).  Verify URL and page content.\n*   **Priority:** Critical\n\n## 4. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agents on which elements and pages to prioritize for analysis and test case generation.\n\n*   **Prioritized Elements:**\n    *   **Homepage Hero Headline:**  Locate the main headline on the homepage, usually within an `<h1>` or `<h2>` tag.  The agent should extract the text content for assertion in SMOKE-003.\n    *   **Navigation Menu:**  Locate the main navigation menu. Look for `<nav>` or `<ul>` tags with common class names like \"nav\", \"menu\", or \"main-menu\".  Agent should extract all `<a>` tags within the menu.\n    *   **\"Get Started\" Button:**  Locate the \"Get Started\" button on the homepage.  Look for `<button>` or `<a>` tags with text content like \"Get Started\", \"Try Free\", \"Free Trial\", or similar calls to action.  Pay attention to `id` and `class` attributes.\n*   **Prioritized Pages:**\n    *   **Homepage (/)**: The starting point for all smoke tests.\n    *   **Pages linked from the main navigation menu:** These pages represent core product offerings and should be verified for accessibility.\n    *   **Target page after clicking \"Get Started\"**: This page is critical to test the core conversion flow and therefore needs to be verified.\n*   **Data Extraction:**\n    *   Extract text content from headings, buttons, and links.\n    *   Extract `href` attributes from links.\n    *   Extract `id` and `class` attributes from all prioritized elements.\n\n## 5. Automation Strategy\n\n*   The smoke test suite should be automated using a reliable testing framework (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Playwright).\n*   Tests should be designed to be independent and easily maintainable.\n*   The test suite should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing.\n*   Consider using environment variables for configuration (e.g., base URL).\n*   Implement proper logging and reporting.\n\n## 6. Metrics\n\n*   **Test Execution Time:**  Track the time it takes to execute the entire smoke test suite.\n*   **Test Pass Rate:**  Monitor the percentage of tests that pass successfully.\n*   **Defect Detection Rate:**  Track the number of defects identified by the smoke tests.\n\n## 7. Maintenance\n\n*   The smoke test suite should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the website's functionality.\n*   Test data should be managed effectively.\n*   Failed tests should be investigated and resolved promptly.\n\nThis Master Test Plan serves as a guide for the autonomous agents to create a robust and effective smoke test suite for the Sauce Labs website. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that the website is operational and ready for further testing.\n```"
