  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on regression testing the \"Navigate to Products page and search for a product\" user goal. This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Product Search\n\n**Application:** AutomationExercise.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n**User Goal:** Navigate to Products page and search for a product\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** E-commerce applications are highly sensitive to errors. Failures in product search directly impact revenue, customer satisfaction, and brand reputation. A broken search function is a P0 (Priority 0) defect.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Inability to find products leads to lost sales.\n    *   **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Frustration with the search experience can drive customers to competitors.\n    *   **Brand Damage:** A poorly functioning website erodes trust and credibility.\n    *   **Data Security:** While the primary goal is product search, security vulnerabilities in the search functionality (e.g., SQL injection) could lead to data breaches.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Navigation to the Products page.\n        *   Search functionality (keyword search, auto-suggestions).\n        *   Search result display (product listing, pagination, sorting).\n        *   Filtering and refinement of search results (e.g., by category, price).\n        *   Error handling (e.g., no results found, invalid search terms).\n        *   Responsiveness across different browsers and devices.\n        *   Accessibility (basic ARIA compliance for search elements).\n        *   Performance (search response time).\n        *   Security (input validation to prevent injection attacks).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Shopping cart functionality (covered in separate test strategy).\n        *   Payment processing (covered in separate test strategy).\n        *   User account management (covered in separate test strategy).\n        *   Detailed product page functionality (covered in separate test strategy).\n        *   API testing (unless directly related to the search functionality).\n        *   Load testing (covered in separate performance test strategy).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   Navigate to the homepage.\n    *   Click on the \"Products\" button in the header.\n    *   Verify that the Products page loads successfully (HTTP 200, page title contains \"Products\").\n    *   Enter a valid search term (e.g., \"Dress\") in the search bar.\n    *   Verify that search results are displayed (at least one product is listed).\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Positive Testing:**\n        *   Search with valid keywords (single word, multiple words, brand names).\n        *   Search with different product categories.\n        *   Verify search result accuracy (results match the search term).\n        *   Verify pagination functionality (navigate through multiple pages of results).\n        *   Verify sorting functionality (sort by price, popularity, etc.).\n        *   Verify filtering functionality (filter by category, brand, price range).\n        *   Verify that product images are displayed correctly.\n        *   Verify that product names and descriptions are accurate.\n        *   Verify that \"Add to Cart\" button is present and functional (basic check).\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Search with invalid keywords (special characters, long strings).\n        *   Search with empty search term.\n        *   Search with keywords that are likely to return no results.\n        *   Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid searches (e.g., \"No products found\").\n        *   Attempt to inject malicious code into the search bar (XSS, SQLi).\n        *   Test boundary values for search filters (e.g., minimum and maximum price).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Search with keywords containing accented characters or special symbols.\n        *   Search with keywords that are similar to existing product names (fuzzy search).\n        *   Search with keywords that are misspelled (typo tolerance).\n        *   Test search functionality under slow network conditions (simulated latency).\n        *   Test search functionality with a large number of concurrent users (simulated concurrency).\n    *   **Security Testing:**\n        *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n        *   Input validation to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\n        *   Check for proper encoding of search terms in URLs.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Static Data:** A set of pre-defined search terms and expected results will be maintained in a data file (e.g., CSV, JSON). This will cover common product categories and brands.\n        *   **Dynamic Generation:** For negative testing and edge cases, dynamically generate invalid search terms and boundary values.\n        *   **Data Masking:** Ensure that any sensitive data (e.g., customer names in product reviews) is properly masked in test data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Products page and search functionality as reusable components. This will improve code maintainability and reduce duplication.\n        *   `HomePage`: Page object for the main page.\n        *   `ProductsPage`: Page object for the Products page, including search bar, filters, and product listings.\n        *   `SearchResult`: Page object for individual search results.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous updates to the search results. This will prevent false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors, such as element not found exceptions.  This could involve retrying the search or refreshing the page.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests, especially those involving network requests.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Products Page:** `https://automationexercise.com/products` - Focus on the initial load, layout, and presence of the search bar and filters.\n    2.  **Search Bar:** The search input field itself. Explore different input types (valid, invalid, special characters).\n    3.  **Search Results:** The area where products are displayed after a search. Analyze the structure, pagination, and sorting options.\n    4.  **Filter Options:** The category, brand, and price filters. Explore different combinations of filters.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that all pages and resources return a 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Page Title:** Verify that the Products page title contains \"Products\".\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that all key elements (search bar, filters, product listings) are visible and interactable.\n    *   **Search Result Count:** Verify that the number of search results matches the expected count (if known).\n    *   **Error Message:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid searches.\n    *   **Accessibility:** Verify basic ARIA compliance for search elements (e.g., labels for input fields).\n    *   **Performance:** Measure the search response time and ensure that it meets the performance requirements (defined in a separate performance test strategy).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing the product search functionality on AutomationExercise.com. It should be used as a guide by the entire engineering team to ensure that the search functionality is robust, reliable, and secure. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as needed based on the evolving requirements of the application."
