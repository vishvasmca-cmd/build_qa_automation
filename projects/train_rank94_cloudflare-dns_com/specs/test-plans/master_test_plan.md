# Test Plan: train_rank94_cloudflare-dns_com

## Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the train_rank94_cloudflare-dns_com project, focusing on verifying the core functionality of the website. The plan includes both smoke and regression testing strategies to ensure a high level of quality.

## Scope

The scope of this test plan covers the functionality of the website, including identifying key elements such as buttons and links.

## Testing Strategy

We will employ a two-pronged testing strategy:

1.  **Smoke Testing**: A quick, high-level test suite to ensure the most critical functionalities are working as expected.
2.  **Regression Testing**: A more comprehensive test suite to ensure that new changes haven't introduced any regressions in existing functionality.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite will focus on the following key aspects:

1.  **Core Functionality**: Verify that the main features of the website are working.
2.  **Critical Paths**: Test the most common user flows.
3.  **Positive Testing**: Focus on happy path scenarios.
4.  **Build Verification**: Ensure the build is stable enough for further testing.
5.  **Fast Execution**: The smoke suite should be quick to execute.
6.  **Limited Scope**: Only cover the most essential functionalities.
7.  **Automated Execution**: The smoke suite should be automated for continuous integration.
8.  **Clear Failure Indicators**: Failures in the smoke suite should clearly indicate critical issues.

## Test Suites

1.  **Smoke Suite**: This suite will include tests to verify the basic functionality of the website, such as identifying buttons and links.
2.  **Regression Suite**: This suite will include more comprehensive tests to cover various scenarios and edge cases.

## Test Environment

The tests will be executed in a standard web browser environment.

## Test Data

No specific test data is required for the smoke tests.
