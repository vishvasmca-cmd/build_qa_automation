  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Cloudflare DNS Website - Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Cloudflare DNS is a critical service for website performance and security. Failure can lead to website unavailability, impacting businesses and users.\n*   **Risk Profile**: High. Website unavailability directly translates to lost revenue, damaged reputation, and potential security vulnerabilities. A failed DNS service can have cascading effects across the internet.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website availability and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key interactive elements (Login, Signup, Try for Free, etc.).\n        *   Menu bar presence and basic structure.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed functionality of any button or link.\n        *   Performance testing (load times, etc.).\n        *   Security testing (vulnerability scans, etc.).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (beyond a single, representative browser).\n        *   Error handling (e.g., 404 pages).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Website Availability**: Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Element**: Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element**: Verify a \"Signup\", \"Get Started\", or similar call-to-action button/link is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element**: Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar trial offer button/link is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button/Link Element 4**: Verify another prominent button/link (e.g., \"Contact Us\", \"Pricing\") is present and visible.\n        6.  **Button/Link Element 5**: Verify another prominent button/link (e.g., \"About Us\", \"Features\") is present and visible.\n        7.  **Link Element 1**: Verify a prominent link (e.g., \"Terms of Service\", \"Privacy Policy\") is present and visible.\n        8.  **Link Element 2**: Verify a prominent link (e.g., \"Documentation\", \"Support\") is present and visible.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1**: Verify the primary menu bar is present and visible.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2**: Verify the secondary menu bar (if any) is present and visible.\n*   **Regression Suite**: Not applicable for a smoke test strategy.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke testing. Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability, even at this early stage.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `BasePage`: Contains common methods (e.g., `isElementPresent`, `getPageTitle`).\n        *   `HomePage`: Extends `BasePage` and contains locators and methods specific to the homepage (e.g., `loginButtonLocator`, `isLoginButtonPresent`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use short polling intervals (e.g., 500ms) with a timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) to check for element presence. This helps mitigate transient loading issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Use explicit waits (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to be present before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  `https://cloudflare-dns.com` (Homepage)\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Website Availability**: HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Presence**: The specified buttons/links/menu bars are present and visible on the page.  Visibility is defined as being rendered and not hidden by CSS or other means.\n    *   **No functional verification**: The tests should NOT click on any buttons or links. The goal is simply to verify their presence.\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   Clear pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Screenshots on failure to aid in debugging.\n    *   Execution time for each test case.\n*   **Environment**:\n    *   Execute tests against a stable environment (e.g., production or a dedicated staging environment).\n    *   Specify the browser used for testing (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Cloudflare DNS website. It focuses on verifying the core functionality and identifying critical issues early in the development lifecycle."
