# Test Plan: train_rank183_miui_com

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the train_rank183_miui_com project, focusing on testing the website functionality at https://miui.com. The plan includes smoke and regression test suites designed to ensure the quality and stability of the application.

## 2. Scope

The testing will cover the core functionalities of the website, including identifying key elements such as links and buttons. The tests will verify the presence and basic functionality of these elements.

## 3. Test Strategy

The testing strategy includes two main suites:
