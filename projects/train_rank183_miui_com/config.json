  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: MIUI.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the smoke testing of MIUI.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the website.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** MIUI.com is the official website for Xiaomi's MIUI operating system. Its primary function is to provide information about MIUI, support resources, and downloads. While not directly an e-commerce platform, its availability and functionality are crucial for user engagement, brand reputation, and software distribution.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure of MIUI.com can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of User Trust:** Inability to access information or support can damage user confidence in the MIUI ecosystem.\n    *   **Reduced Software Adoption:** Difficulty in downloading or accessing information about MIUI can hinder adoption rates.\n    *   **Negative Brand Perception:** A malfunctioning website reflects poorly on the Xiaomi brand.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or equivalent), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic rendering.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking or interacting with any elements (buttons, links, menus).\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature or page.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initial focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness testing (initial focus on desktop).\n        *   Error handling or negative scenarios.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and the core elements are present and rendered correctly.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully in the browser.\n        2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of:\n            *   Login button (or equivalent).\n            *   Signup/Get Started button (or equivalent).\n            *   Try for Free button (or equivalent).\n            *   5 additional buttons (any buttons on the homepage).\n            *   2 links (any links on the homepage).\n            *   2 menu bars (navigation menus).\n    *   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All elements must be present and rendered without obvious visual defects.\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined separately.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Recommended for future test automation. Create Page Objects for the Home page, Login page (if applicable), and any other relevant sections. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for element to be present) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for element identification in case of intermittent loading issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://miui.com):** Focus on identifying the required elements (buttons, links, menus) on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and page title contains \"MIUI\" (or a relevant keyword).\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   Elements are present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n        *   Elements are visible on the page.\n        *   Elements are rendered without obvious visual defects (e.g., broken images, overlapping text).\n*   **Success Definition:** All verification criteria are met. The website loads successfully, and all required elements are present and rendered correctly.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for the smoke testing of MIUI.com. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the website's core functionality is working as expected, minimizing the risk of critical failures and maintaining a positive user experience."
