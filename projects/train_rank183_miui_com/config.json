  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: MIUI.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the initial smoke testing of MIUI.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** MIUI.com is the official website for Xiaomi's MIUI operating system. Its primary purpose is to provide information about MIUI, allow users to download the OS, and offer support resources. Failure of the website can lead to user frustration, negative brand perception, and potential loss of user base.\n*   **Risk Profile:** The risk profile is moderate. While a complete outage would be highly visible and damaging, intermittent issues or minor functional failures pose a lesser threat. Key risks include:\n    *   **Inability to access the website:** Prevents users from accessing information and downloading the OS.\n    *   **Broken links or buttons:** Frustrates users and hinders navigation.\n    *   **Login/Signup failures:** Prevents users from accessing account-related features.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and load time.\n        *   Presence and basic functionality of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started/Try for Free buttons (5 total), 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Visual verification of key elements (e.g., logo, navigation).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functional testing of individual features.\n        *   Performance testing beyond basic load time.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited to primary browsers).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness testing (limited to basic verification).\n        *   Error handling and negative testing.\n        *   Clicking on any of the buttons, links, or menu bars.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test focuses on verifying the core functionality and availability of MIUI.com.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the website loads successfully within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n    2.  **Key Element Presence:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n        *   Login button/link\n        *   Signup/Get Started/Try for Free button/link (at least one of these)\n        *   Five (5) distinct buttons (any buttons on the page)\n        *   Two (2) distinct links (any links on the page)\n        *   Two (2) distinct menu bars (navigation menus)\n    3.  **Visual Verification:** Verify the basic visual appearance of the website, including the logo and main navigation elements.\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this initial smoke test. Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:** This smoke test does not require any specific test data. It focuses on verifying the presence and basic functionality of UI elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** A lightweight framework using Selenium or Playwright with a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended. This will allow for easy maintenance and scalability as the testing effort expands.\n    *   **Base Page:** Contains common methods for interacting with the browser and verifying element presence.\n    *   **Home Page:** Represents the MIUI.com homepage and contains locators for the key elements to be verified.\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential timing issues when verifying element presence. This allows the test to wait for an element to appear before failing.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://miui.com):** Focus on the main navigation, header, and footer sections to identify the required buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Availability:** HTTP 200 status code and page load within 5 seconds.\n    *   **Key Element Presence:** The specified elements (Login, Signup/Get Started/Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present on the page and visible. Use appropriate CSS selectors or XPath expressions to locate the elements.\n    *   **Visual Verification:** The website logo is displayed correctly, and the main navigation elements are visually consistent with the expected design.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for the initial smoke testing of MIUI.com. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the website's core functionality and availability are verified effectively."
