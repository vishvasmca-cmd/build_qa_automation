  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: MIUI.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the MIUI.com website smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** MIUI.com is the official website for Xiaomi's MIUI operating system. Its business criticality lies in providing information, downloads, support, and community engagement for MIUI users. Failure can lead to user frustration, negative brand perception, and reduced adoption of MIUI.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failure can result in:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user reviews and social media backlash.\n    *   **Reduced User Engagement:** Decreased downloads, forum activity, and overall community participation.\n    *   **Loss of Trust:** Erosion of user confidence in Xiaomi and MIUI.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Existence and visibility of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, and any other 5 prominent buttons.\n        *   Existence and visibility of 2 links.\n        *   Existence and visibility of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu items (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the MIUI.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is visible on the homepage.\n        4.  **Button Presence (5):** Verify the presence of 5 other prominent buttons on the homepage (e.g., \"Download,\" \"Forum,\" \"Support,\" \"Themes,\" \"Devices\").\n        5.  **Link Presence (2):** Verify the presence of 2 links on the homepage (e.g., \"Privacy Policy,\" \"Terms of Service\").\n        6.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Verify the presence of 2 menu bars (e.g., top navigation, footer navigation).\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for a smoke test.  Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test as it focuses on element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the MIUI.com homepage as a Page Object. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains locators for Login button, Signup button, other buttons, links, and menu bars.\n        *   Methods: `isLoginButtonPresent()`, `isSignupButtonPresent()`, `areButtonsPresent(int count)`, `areLinksPresent(int count)`, `areMenuBarsPresent(int count)`.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with reasonable timeouts to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness due to network latency.\n    *   Example: `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id(\"loginButton\")));`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed test cases due to transient issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **MIUI.com Homepage:** Focus the autonomous agent on the homepage (`https://miui.com`).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code AND `<title>` tag contains \"MIUI\" or \"Xiaomi\".\n    *   **Element Presence:** Element is visible on the page (using `element.isDisplayed()`).\n    *   **Button Presence:** Verify that the button element exists and is visible.\n    *   **Link Presence:** Verify that the link element exists and is visible.\n    *   **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify that the menu bar element exists and is visible.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clearly report any failed test cases with detailed error messages and screenshots.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing the MIUI.com smoke test. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a robust and reliable testing process."
