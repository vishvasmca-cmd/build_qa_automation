  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: DNS.Google Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the DNS.Google website smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** DNS.Google provides a public DNS service. While not directly revenue-generating, its availability is crucial for internet accessibility and Google's overall infrastructure. Outages can lead to widespread connectivity issues and damage Google's reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of DNS.Google can result in:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative publicity and loss of user trust.\n    *   **Service Disruption:** Widespread internet connectivity issues for users relying on the service.\n    *   **Indirect Financial Impact:** Potential impact on other Google services dependent on DNS resolution.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Presence of key UI elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action buttons), 5 buttons total, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Verification of HTTP 200 status for the main page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the DNS service itself (DNS resolution testing).\n        *   Clicking and navigating through links and buttons.\n        *   Form submission and user authentication.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness testing (initially).\n        *   Error handling and negative scenarios.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and the core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the DNS.Google website loads successfully and returns an HTTP 200 status code.\n        2.  **UI Element Verification:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   At least 5 buttons (e.g., Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, etc.).\n            *   At least 2 links.\n            *   At least 2 menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this smoke test strategy. A separate regression strategy will be defined later.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the DNS.Google website. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` object containing locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to be present on the page. This helps handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the website launch test in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** The DNS.Google homepage (`https://dns.google`).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n    *   **UI Element Verification:**\n        *   Element Presence: The specified number of buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page.\n        *   Element Visibility: The elements are visible to the user (not hidden by CSS or other means).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed tests, including screenshots and relevant logs."
