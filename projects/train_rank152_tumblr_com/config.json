  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Tumblr Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Tumblr is a social media platform focused on content sharing and community. Core functionalities include user registration, login, content creation, and content consumption.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities can lead to user frustration, loss of engagement, and potential damage to brand reputation. While not directly financial, prolonged outages or critical bugs can impact user growth and retention.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic attributes (e.g., text, visibility).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any UI elements.\n        *   Functional testing of login, signup, or any other features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially).\n        *   API testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the basic health of the Tumblr website.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Tumblr homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element Check:** Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Check:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element Check:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button/link is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button Element Check (5):** Verify 5 other buttons are present and visible.\n        6.  **Link Element Check (2):** Verify 2 other links are present and visible.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Check (2):** Verify 2 menu bars are present and visible.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for a smoke test, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   This will be developed later and will cover all functionalities of Tumblr, including user registration, login, content creation, content consumption, search, and settings.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For this smoke test, no specific test data is required. The focus is on UI element presence.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Tumblr homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   `HomePage`: Page object representing the Tumblr homepage. It should contain methods to locate and interact with the UI elements mentioned above.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to be visible before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Tumblr Homepage (https://tumblr.com):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 and the presence of the main Tumblr content (e.g., logo, tagline).\n    *   **UI Element Checks:**\n        *   Elements are present in the DOM.\n        *   Elements are visible on the page.\n        *   Elements have the expected text (e.g., \"Login\", \"Signup\").\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   A clear and concise report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for any failed test cases.\n    *   Screenshots of the page in case of failures."
