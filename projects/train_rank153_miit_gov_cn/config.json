  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: miit.gov.cn - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the miit.gov.cn website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** miit.gov.cn is the website for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China. As a government website, its availability and basic functionality are crucial for public access to information and services.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Public Trust:** Inability to access government information can erode public confidence.\n    *   **Dissemination of Misinformation:** If the official website is down, users may rely on unofficial sources.\n    *   **Impeded Communication:** Disruptions can hinder communication between the ministry and the public/industry stakeholders.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Presence and visibility of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, 5 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu items (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is visible on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar button is visible.\n        4.  **Button Presence (5 Others):** Verify the presence of 5 other distinct buttons on the page.\n        5.  **Link Presence (2):** Verify the presence of 2 distinct links on the page.\n        6.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bars on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** While the scope is limited, POM provides a good foundation for future expansion. Create a base `HomePage` object.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (wait-until) to check for element presence. This accounts for potential delays in element rendering. Example: `waitUntilElementIsVisible(loginButtonLocator)`.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial website load test in case of temporary network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target for all smoke tests.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence (Buttons, Links, Menu Bars):**\n        *   Element is present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n        *   Element is visible on the page (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()` returns `true`).\n        *   Element is enabled (if applicable).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear pass/fail indication for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failures (e.g., \"Login button not found\").\n    *   Include screenshots for failed tests.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the miit.gov.cn website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the website's core functionality is validated quickly and efficiently."
