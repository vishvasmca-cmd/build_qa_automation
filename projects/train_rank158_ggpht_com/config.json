  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Smoke Testing for ggpht.com\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the ggpht.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated smoke tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** ggpht.com appears to be a general web application, potentially related to image hosting or Google services. While not explicitly e-commerce, its availability and basic functionality are crucial for user access and potential integration with other Google services.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionality (website launch, navigation) leads to user frustration, inability to access services, and potential negative impact on Google's brand reputation.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar) buttons.\n        *   Identification of 2 links and 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific features.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, or similar).\n        3.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined separately.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the website's pages and elements. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains locators and methods for interacting with the homepage (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential loading delays. This avoids false failures due to elements not being immediately visible.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to be present and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test execution in case of transient network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** The primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   Buttons: Verify that at least 5 buttons with relevant text (Login, Signup, Get Started, Try for Free, etc.) are present on the page. Use `element.isDisplayed()` to confirm visibility.\n        *   Links: Verify that at least 2 links are present on the page. Use `element.isDisplayed()` to confirm visibility.\n        *   Menu Bars: Verify that at least 2 menu bars are present on the page. Use `element.isDisplayed()` to confirm visibility.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed tests, including screenshots and relevant logs.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the ggpht.com website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality of the website is verified quickly and efficiently."
