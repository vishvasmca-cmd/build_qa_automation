  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the OrangeHRM application (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding test planning, architecture, and execution. This strategy focuses on regression testing, ensuring that existing functionality remains intact with new changes.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: The application is an HR management system. Core functionalities include user management, employee information management, and directory services. Incorrect implementation or failures in these areas can lead to operational inefficiencies, data integrity issues, and potential legal compliance problems.\n\n*   **Risk Profile**:\n    *   **Data Integrity**: Incorrect employee data (salary, personal information) can lead to significant financial and legal repercussions.\n    *   **Access Control**: Unauthorized access or incorrect role assignments can lead to security breaches and data leaks.\n    *   **Workflow Disruption**: Failure of key HR processes (e.g., onboarding, leave management) can disrupt business operations.\n    *   **Reporting Accuracy**: Errors in reports (e.g., headcount, diversity) can lead to flawed decision-making.\n    *   **Compliance Issues**: Incorrect tax calculations, leave accrual errors, or other compliance failures could result in penalties.\n\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   User Management (creation, modification, deletion, role assignment).\n        *   Employee Information Management (personal details, job details, salary, contact information).\n        *   Directory Services (search, filtering).\n        *   Login/Logout functionality.\n        *   All related workflows and UI elements.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Performance testing (unless specifically requested).\n        *   Security testing beyond basic input validation and OWASP Top 10 checks.\n        *   API testing (unless directly related to the user workflows).\n        *   Integration with external systems (unless specifically identified).\n        *   Detailed reporting module (unless a failure in this area impacts other areas within scope).\n        *   Localization testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**: A minimal set of tests executed after each build to verify core functionality. This must be completed before any other testing occurs.\n\n    *   Login with valid credentials ('Admin'/'admin123').\n    *   Verify successful login and page load (Admin dashboard visible).\n    *   Navigate to PIM -> Employee List.\n    *   Verify employee list page loads.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**: A comprehensive suite of tests executed to ensure that new changes haven't broken existing functionality.\n\n    *   **Negative Testing**:\n        *   Invalid Login attempts (incorrect password, username).\n        *   Invalid User creation (missing required fields, invalid email format, password complexity violations).\n        *   Invalid Employee creation (missing required fields, invalid date formats).\n        *   Searching for non-existent employees.\n        *   Input fields that exceed maximum length.\n    *   **Edge Cases**:\n        *   Concurrency: Multiple users simultaneously creating or modifying user/employee data.\n        *   Network Failures: Simulate network timeouts during user creation or employee updates.\n        *   Empty States: Verify appropriate behavior and messages when lists are empty (e.g., no employees found).\n        *   Boundary Analysis: Create users with the maximum allowed characters in usernames, passwords, first/last names.\n    *   **Security Testing**:\n        *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on input fields (user names, passwords, employee data) to prevent SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n        *   Password Complexity Enforcement: Validate that the password policy is enforced during user creation and password reset.\n    *   **Functional Testing based on User Goal:**\n        *   Login 'Admin'/'admin123'.\n        *   Click Admin.\n        *   Click Add (User).\n        *   Role 'ESS'.\n        *   Name 'Ranga Akunuri'.\n        *   Status 'Enabled'.\n        *   User 'testuser\\_8315'.\n        *   Pass 'Password123!'.\n        *   Save.\n        *   Click PIM.\n        *   Add Employee. First 'John', Last 'Doe'.\n        *   Save.\n        *   Click Directory.\n        *   Search 'John Doe'.\n        *   Logout.\n\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n\n    *   **Test Data Creation**: A mix of static and dynamic test data.\n        *   **Static**: Use a small set of predefined users (e.g., 'Admin') with known credentials for smoke tests and consistent regression testing.\n        *   **Dynamic**: Generate unique usernames, employee IDs, and other data dynamically for regression tests to avoid conflicts and ensure data integrity.  Utilize faker libraries to generate realistic data for employee information.\n    *   **Data Management**:\n        *   Consider using a test data management (TDM) tool or strategy for larger regression suites. This helps to ensure data consistency, avoid conflicts, and refresh data as needed.\n        *   Implement a cleanup process to remove dynamically generated data after tests complete to prevent data buildup and potential performance issues.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:  Page Object Model (POM) with a clear separation of concerns.\n    *   **Page Objects**: Represent each page of the application with its elements and actions.\n    *   **Test Cases**: Focus on business logic and user workflows, utilizing Page Objects to interact with the application.\n    *   **Utilities**: Implement helper functions for data generation, common actions, and reporting.\n*   **Technology Stack**:\n    *   Programming Language: Java or Python (based on team skillset).\n    *   Test Automation Framework: Selenium WebDriver.\n    *   Assertion Library: AssertJ or Hamcrest.\n    *   Reporting: Allure or Extent Reports.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Implement polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing**: Implement basic self-healing mechanisms by retrying failed element interactions or re-locating elements dynamically if they are not found.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests, especially those involving network interactions or asynchronous updates.  Limit the number of retries to avoid masking real issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Favor explicit waits over implicit waits to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them. Implicit waits can lead to unpredictable behavior and flaky tests.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    *   **Login Page**: Focus on different login scenarios (valid credentials, invalid credentials, locked accounts).\n    *   **Admin -> User Management (Add User)**: Explore all input fields, role assignments, status options, and password policies.\n    *   **PIM -> Add Employee**: Explore different data combinations, required fields, and saving workflows.\n    *   **Directory Search**: Explore different search criteria and filtering options.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Successful Login**: HTTP 200 status code AND \"Welcome\" message or dashboard elements are visible.\n    *   **User Creation**: HTTP 200 status code AND user appears in the user list with the correct attributes.\n    *   **Employee Creation**: HTTP 200 status code AND employee appears in the employee list with the correct attributes.\n    *   **Directory Search**: HTTP 200 status code AND relevant employee information is displayed.\n    *   **Error Messages**: Verify accurate and user-friendly error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or failed operations.\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   Generate detailed test reports with clear failure messages and screenshots/videos to aid in debugging.\n    *   Track test execution metrics (pass rate, failure rate, execution time) to identify areas for improvement.\n*   **Exploratory Testing**:\n    *   Allocate time for exploratory testing to uncover unexpected issues and edge cases.  Focus on areas identified as high-risk.\n*   **Test Prioritization**:\n    *   Prioritize test cases based on risk and business impact.  Focus on testing critical functionalities first.\n    *   Utilize risk-based testing techniques to allocate testing effort effectively."
