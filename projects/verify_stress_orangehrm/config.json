  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Regression Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the OrangeHRM application (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/), focusing on comprehensive regression testing. This strategy aims to ensure the stability and reliability of the application following any code changes or updates.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1. Domain Analysis\n\nOrangeHRM is a Human Resources Management system. Critical areas include:\n\n*   **User Authentication:**  Login/Logout functionality. Failure impacts all users.\n*   **User Management (Admin):** Adding, editing, and managing user accounts. Errors can lead to security vulnerabilities or access issues.\n*   **Employee Management (PIM):** Managing employee information. Incorrect data affects HR processes (payroll, benefits).\n*   **Directory:** Ability to search the directory. Impacts the business' efficiency in finding people.\n\nGiven the nature of HR data, data integrity and security are paramount.\n\n### 1.2. Risk Profile\n\nSystem failures in OrangeHRM could lead to:\n\n*   **Data Breaches:**  Compromised employee data.\n*   **Financial Loss:**  Errors in payroll or benefits calculations.\n*   **Legal Issues:**  Non-compliance with data privacy regulations.\n*   **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of trust in the HR department and the company.\n*   **Operational Disruption:**  Inability to manage HR processes effectively.\n\nTherefore, a robust testing strategy is essential.\n\n### 1.3. Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionality described in the User Goal.\n*   All core modules related to User Management (Admin), Employee Management (PIM), and Directory.\n*   Positive and negative test cases for all input fields.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   Data validation (database integrity).\n*   Security testing (basic OWASP Top 10).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress).  (Recommend a separate strategy for this).\n*   Mobile testing. (Recommend a separate strategy for this).\n*   Detailed API testing. (Consider basic API validation where relevant to core flows).\n*   Internationalization (i18n) testing (unless specifically required).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1. Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThis suite verifies the basic health of the application.\n\n*   **Login Success:** Log in with valid 'Admin'/'admin123' credentials.\n*   **Admin Page Load:** Navigate to the Admin page successfully.\n*   **PIM Page Load:** Navigate to the PIM page successfully.\n*   **Directory Page Load:** Navigate to the Directory page successfully.\n\nIf any of these tests fail, the build is considered broken and further testing is halted.\n\n### 2.2. Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThis suite provides comprehensive testing of all functionality.\n\n*   **User Management (Admin Module):**\n    *   **Positive:** Add a new user with valid data (as per User Goal). Verify the user is created successfully. Verify the user can login with the new credentials.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Attempt to add a user with an existing username.\n        *   Attempt to add a user with invalid password (e.g., too short, missing special characters).\n        *   Attempt to add a user with missing required fields.\n        *   Attempt to create user with XSS payload in the username field.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Add a user with maximum allowed length for all fields.\n        *   Add a user with special characters in the name and username fields.\n\n*   **Employee Management (PIM Module):**\n    *   **Positive:** Add a new employee with valid data (as per User Goal). Verify the employee is created successfully.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Attempt to add an employee with missing required fields.\n        *   Attempt to add an employee with invalid data (e.g., invalid date format).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Add an employee with maximum allowed length for all fields.\n        *   Add an employee with special characters in the name fields.\n\n*   **Directory Module:**\n    *   **Positive:** Search for the newly created employee ('John Doe'). Verify the employee is found in the search results.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Search for a non-existent employee.\n        *   Search with partial names.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Search with special characters in the search term.\n        *   Search with very long search terms.\n\n*   **Login/Logout:**\n    *   **Positive:** Verify the user can logout successfully.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Attempt to login with invalid credentials.\n        *   Attempt to login with a locked account.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrent login attempts from different browsers.\n        *   Session timeout.\n\n*   **Security Testing (Basic OWASP):**\n    *   Input field validation to prevent XSS attacks (especially in User Management and PIM modules).\n    *   Parameter tampering checks (verify that user roles cannot be manipulated through URL parameters).\n\n### 2.3. Data Strategy\n\n*   **Dynamic Test Data Generation:**  Use dynamic data generation for usernames (e.g., `testuser_<timestamp>`) to avoid conflicts.\n*   **Data Seeding:** Consider seeding the database with a set of baseline test data for consistent test execution.\n*   **Data Cleanup:** Implement mechanisms to clean up test data after test execution (e.g., delete created users and employees).\n*   **Sensitive Data Handling:**  Ensure sensitive data (passwords) are handled securely (encrypted storage, masked in logs).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1. Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure for maintainability and reusability. Each page/component in OrangeHRM should have a corresponding Page Object class.\n*   **Language:** Java or Python are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n*   **Testing Framework:** JUnit or TestNG (Java) or pytest (Python).\n*   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ (Java) or Pytest-Assert (Python).\n*   **Reporting:** ExtentReports (Java) or Allure Report (Python).\n\n### 3.2. Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., with `awaitility` in Java) to handle asynchronous operations and eventual consistency. Instead of immediately failing, retry assertions for a specified duration.\n*   **Explicit Waits:**  Use explicit waits (WebDriverWait) with appropriate timeouts to handle dynamic page loading.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement basic self-healing mechanisms (e.g., retry failed actions, re-initialize the browser).\n*   **Test Isolation:**  Ensure tests are independent and do not rely on the state of previous tests.  Use data cleanup after each test to maintain a clean environment.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Configure the test framework to automatically retry failed tests (with a limited number of retries).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1. Mining Targets (Prioritized Exploration)\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages/flows first:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login`\n2.  **Admin -> User Management -> Users -> Add User:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/viewSystemUsers` (After Login)\n3.  **PIM -> Add Employee:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/pim/addEmployee` (After Login)\n4.  **Directory:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/directory/viewDirectory` (After Login)\n\n### 4.2. Verification Criteria\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Successful requests should return HTTP 200. Redirects (e.g. after login) should return 302.\n*   **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of key elements on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" text after login, form labels, buttons).\n*   **Data Validation:** Verify that data is saved correctly in the database (e.g., using SQL queries).\n*   **Error Messages:** Verify the presence and correctness of error messages for negative test cases.\n*   **UI Rendering:** Verify that the UI renders correctly across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   **Functional Success:** The final 'Save' action on each page is successful and the expected data is visible (new user, new employee).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the quality and stability of the OrangeHRM application. Regular review and updates to this strategy are essential to adapt to evolving business requirements and technological changes."
