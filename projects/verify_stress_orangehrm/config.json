  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Regression Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n**Domain Analysis**: OrangeHRM is a Human Resources Management (HRM) system. Critical functions include user management, employee information management, and directory services. Data accuracy and security are paramount.\n\n**Risk Profile**: Failure in this system can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss**: Incorrect payroll, compliance issues.\n*   **Data Breach**: Leakage of sensitive employee information.\n*   **Trust Loss**: Damage to employee morale and company reputation.\n*   **Operational Disruption**: Inability to manage employees effectively.\n\n**Testing Scope**:\n\n*   **In Scope**: All functionalities exercised in the user goal, including:\n    *   User Login/Logout\n    *   User Management (Add User)\n    *   Employee Information Management (Add Employee)\n    *   Directory Search\n    *   Input validation and error handling for all fields.\n    *   Cross-module interactions between Admin, PIM, and Directory.\n    *   Security checks for common vulnerabilities (input sanitization).\n*   **Out of Scope**:\n    *   Performance Testing (load, stress, etc.)\n    *   Full Security Audit (penetration testing)\n    *   All modules not explicitly used in the user goal (e.g., Leave, Time).\n    *   Compatibility testing across all browsers and devices (focus on major browsers).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy emphasizes a comprehensive regression suite to ensure the stability and reliability of the core HR functionalities.\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Goal**: Verify basic system health.\n*   **Test Cases**:\n    1.  Navigate to the login page.\n    2.  Enter valid credentials (\"Admin\"/\"admin123\").\n    3.  Verify successful login (e.g., dashboard is displayed).\n    4.  Logout.\n*   **Success Criteria**: All tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThis suite will cover the user goal with extensive variations and negative testing.\n\n*   **User Management (Admin -> Add User)**:\n    *   **Positive**: Verify successful user creation with valid data.\n    *   **Negative**:\n        *   Invalid input for Role (e.g., special characters).\n        *   Empty or whitespace input for required fields (Name, User, Password).\n        *   Duplicate username.\n        *   Password strength validation (e.g., insufficient length, missing special characters).\n        *   Invalid status values.\n    *   **Boundary**: Maximum length for User and Name fields.\n*   **Employee Information Management (PIM -> Add Employee)**:\n    *   **Positive**: Verify successful employee creation.\n    *   **Negative**:\n        *   Invalid input for First Name and Last Name (e.g., numbers, special characters).\n        *   Empty or whitespace input for required fields.\n        *   Exceeding maximum field lengths.\n    *   **Boundary**: Check maximum length for First Name and Last Name.\n*   **Directory Search**:\n    *   **Positive**: Verify correct search results are displayed for existing employees.\n    *   **Negative**:\n        *   Search for non-existent employees.\n        *   Partial name search.\n        *   Case-insensitive search.\n        *   Searching with special characters.\n*   **Security**:\n    *   **XSS**: Attempt to inject JavaScript into input fields (User, Name, First Name, Last Name) to check for stored or reflected XSS vulnerabilities.\n    *   **SQL Injection**: Attempt to inject SQL code into input fields to check for SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\n### Data Strategy\n\n*   **Dynamic Generation**: Use dynamic data generation for usernames (e.g., `testuser_<timestamp>`) to avoid conflicts. Passwords should be generated according to application security standards.\n*   **Data Persistence**: Store successful employee and user creation data in a data table (CSV, database) for use in subsequent tests (e.g., login with a created user).\n*   **Data Cleanup**: Implement a cleanup process to delete test users and employees after test execution to maintain data integrity.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**: **Page Object Model (POM)** with a modular structure.\n    *   Create separate page objects for: `LoginPage`, `AdminPage`, `AddUserPage`, `PIMPage`, `AddEmployeePage`, `DirectoryPage`.\n    *   Implement reusable components (e.g., `FormInputField`, `DropdownSelector`, `ConfirmationDialog`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous operations (e.g., waiting for a user to be created).\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Implement explicit waits for elements to be present and interactable before performing actions.\n    *   **Self-Healing**: Implement mechanisms to locate elements dynamically using multiple locators (e.g., ID, Name, XPath) in case of minor UI changes.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests (e.g., network glitches) with a limited number of retries.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**: Prioritize exploration of the following pages/flows:\n    1.  `LoginPage`:  Focus on different login attempts (valid, invalid, locked accounts).\n    2.  `AdminPage`: Explore all options under the Admin tab, paying special attention to User Management and access control.\n    3.  `AddUserPage`:  Focus on role-based access and the implications of assigning different roles.\n    4.  `PIMPage`:  Investigate different employee information fields and their impact on other modules.\n    5.  `AddEmployeePage`: Focus on the fields that determine the display in Directory.\n    6.  `DirectoryPage`: Verify different search criteria and filtering options.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes**: Verify that all requests return HTTP 200 (OK) for successful operations and appropriate error codes for failures.\n    *   **UI Text**: Verify that specific text elements (e.g., success messages, error messages, labels) are displayed correctly.\n    *   **Data Validation**: Verify that data entered in the UI is correctly stored in the database.\n    *   **Database Verification**: Check created/updated records in the backend database.\n    *   **Functional Flows**: Complete end-to-end flows to ensure seamless integration between modules. (e.g., creating a user in Admin and then logging in with that user).\n*   **Reporting**: Generate detailed test reports with clear pass/fail statuses, error messages, and screenshots for failed tests. Track test execution metrics (e.g., pass rate, failure rate, execution time) to identify areas for improvement."
