  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke Testing\n**User Goal:** Login with standard_user, sort products by price, add low-cost item to cart, and finish checkout.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** Saucedemo.com is an e-commerce platform, albeit a demo one. While not directly tied to real-world financial transactions, failures can still impact perceived reliability and user experience, which are crucial for demonstrating the platform's capabilities.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High Risk:** Failure of core functionalities like login, product display, adding to cart, and checkout. These failures would render the application unusable.\n    *   **Medium Risk:** Issues with sorting functionality. While not critical, it impacts the user's ability to find desired products efficiently.\n    *   **Low Risk:** Minor UI glitches or non-critical error messages.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Login functionality with the `standard_user` account.\n        *   Product catalog display.\n        *   Product sorting by price (low to high).\n        *   Adding a low-cost item to the cart.\n        *   Checkout process (including shipping information and payment).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials, locked accounts).\n        *   Detailed product description validation.\n        *   All other sorting options.\n        *   Adding multiple items to the cart.\n        *   Coupon code application.\n        *   Payment gateway integration (assume successful payment).\n        *   Order history.\n        *   Account management features.\n        *   UI/UX edge cases (browser compatibility, responsiveness).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Overall Approach:** This smoke test suite will focus on verifying the core \"happy path\" functionality required for a user to successfully log in, find a product, add it to their cart, and complete the checkout process. The tests will be designed to be fast and reliable, providing a quick indication of the application's health.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the fundamental functionality of the application.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Login:** Navigate to the login page, enter `standard_user` credentials, and verify successful login (redirect to product page).\n        2.  **Product Load:** Verify that the product page loads successfully and displays a list of products.\n        3.  **Sort Products:** Sort products by price (low to high) and verify that the products are displayed in the correct order.\n        4.  **Add to Cart:** Add the lowest-priced item to the cart.\n        5.  **Checkout:** Navigate to the cart, proceed to checkout, enter valid shipping information, and complete the order.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Static Data:** Use the pre-defined `standard_user` credentials.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically identify the lowest-priced item on the product page. Shipping information can be hardcoded for simplicity in this smoke test.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** *Note: While this is a smoke test strategy, I'm including a brief outline of the regression strategy for future expansion.*\n    *   **Objective:** Ensure that new changes haven't broken existing functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases (Examples):**\n        *   All smoke test cases.\n        *   Login with invalid credentials.\n        *   Add multiple items to the cart.\n        *   Remove items from the cart.\n        *   Test different shipping addresses.\n        *   Verify error messages for invalid input.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Generate random user data for registration and checkout.\n        *   **Data Pools:** Maintain pools of test data for different scenarios (e.g., valid/invalid addresses, payment information).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and readability. Create separate page objects for:\n        *   LoginPage\n        *   ProductsPage\n        *   CartPage\n        *   CheckoutPage\n        *   CheckoutOverviewPage\n        *   CheckoutCompletePage\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (wait-until) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to handle dynamic content loading.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., retry a test 1-2 times before failing).\n    *   **Self-Healing (Basic):**\n        *   Implement element locators with multiple strategies (e.g., ID, CSS selector, XPath) to increase resilience to UI changes. Prioritize stable locators like IDs.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Initial Focus):**\n    1.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/` (Login Page)\n    2.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html` (Products Page)\n    3.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html` (Cart Page)\n    4.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-one.html` (Checkout Information Page)\n    5.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html` (Checkout Overview Page)\n    6.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-complete.html` (Checkout Complete Page)\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **General:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n        *   No JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n    *   **Specific:**\n        *   **Login:** Successful redirect to the product page after entering valid credentials.\n        *   **Product Load:** Verify that at least one product is displayed on the product page.\n        *   **Sort Products:** Verify that the products are sorted by price (low to high).\n        *   **Add to Cart:** Verify that the cart icon displays the correct number of items in the cart.\n        *   **Checkout:** Verify that the order is successfully placed and the \"Thank You\" message is displayed on the confirmation page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust and reliable smoke test suite for Saucedemo.com. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and your testing needs change."
