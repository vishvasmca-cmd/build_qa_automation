  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo E-Commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Saucedemo e-commerce application, ensuring a robust and reliable testing approach. This strategy will guide all testing activities, from initial smoke tests to comprehensive regression testing, and will be used by the entire engineering team.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Saucedemo is an e-commerce platform. The most critical areas are Authentication, Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, and Checkout & Payments.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failure in critical areas (Checkout, Payments) can lead to direct financial loss and customer dissatisfaction. Data breaches (e.g., user credentials) can result in severe reputational damage.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Authentication (Login, Logout)\n        *   Product Catalog (Viewing, Sorting)\n        *   Shopping Cart (Adding, Removing, Updating)\n        *   Checkout & Payments (Order Placement)\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed performance testing (beyond basic load times)\n        *   Detailed security penetration testing (beyond basic vulnerability checks)\n        *   Third-party integrations (payment gateways) - Stubs/Mocks will be used.\n        *   Accessibility testing (initial phase)\n        *   Detailed UI/UX testing (beyond basic layout verification)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy employs a two-tiered approach: Smoke and Regression testing.\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Definition**: A minimal set of 'Happy Path' tests that verify the system's most critical functions are working. If these fail, the build is rejected.\n*   **Goal**: Rapidly assess the stability of a new build.\n*   **Scope**:\n    *   Critical Paths (e.g., Login, Checkout)\n    *   Core Business Logic (Primary Revenue/Operation Flows)\n    *   No negative testing (unless critical security)\n    *   No complex edge cases\n*   **Test Cases (Based on User Goal)**:\n    1.  **Login**: Successfully log in with the `standard_user` account.\n    2.  **Product Catalog**: Load the product catalog page.\n    3.  **Sort Products**: Successfully sort products by price (low to high).\n    4.  **Add to Cart**: Add the lowest-priced item to the cart.\n    5.  **Checkout**: Complete the checkout process with valid shipping information.\n*   **Execution Frequency**: After every build/deployment.\n\n### Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Definition**: A comprehensive suite of tests ensuring that recent changes have not broken existing functionality. Covers variations, edge cases, and error handling.\n*   **Goal**: Ensure the stability and reliability of the application over time.\n*   **Scope**:\n    *   Alternative Flows (e.g., Payment with PayPal vs Credit Card)\n    *   Negative Scenarios (e.g., Invalid Login, Out of Stock)\n    *   Boundary Analysis (e.g., Min/Max quantities)\n    *   Cross-Module Interactions (e.g., Cart update reflects in Header)\n    *   Validation Messages (e.g., 'Email is required')\n*   **Regression Candidates (Examples)**:\n    *   **Authentication**:\n        *   Login with Invalid Password\n        *   Login with Locked Account\n        *   Password Reset Flow\n        *   Registration with Existing Email\n    *   **Product Catalog**:\n        *   Filter products by Price/Category\n        *   Sort products (Price High-Low)\n        *   Search for non-existent product\n        *   Verify Pagination\n    *   **Shopping Cart**:\n        *   Update Quantity in Cart\n        *   Remove Item from Cart\n        *   Add Out-of-Stock Item (Verify Error)\n        *   Cart Persistence (Refresh Page)\n    *   **Checkout & Payments**:\n        *   Checkout with formatted Address\n        *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code\n        *   Payment Decline Simulation\n        *   Calculate Tax/Shipping correctly\n*   **Execution Frequency**: Nightly, Weekly, or after significant code changes.\n\n### Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data**: A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data**: Predefined user accounts (e.g., `standard_user`, `locked_out_user`) and product information.\n    *   **Dynamic Data**: Dynamically generated data for fields like email addresses, shipping addresses, and order numbers. This will help avoid data conflicts and ensure test repeatability.\n*   **Data Management**: Test data will be stored in a centralized location (e.g., JSON files, database) and managed using data-driven testing techniques.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**: Page Object Model (POM) with a modular design.\n    *   **Rationale**: POM promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability. It abstracts the UI elements and interactions into reusable page objects.\n    *   **Structure**:\n        *   `pages`: Contains page objects representing each page of the application (e.g., `LoginPage`, `ProductPage`, `CartPage`, `CheckoutPage`).\n        *   `components`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `Header`, `Footer`, `ProductCard`).\n        *   `tests`: Contains test cases that utilize the page objects.\n        *   `utils`: Utility functions (e.g., data generation, reporting).\n        *   `config`: Configuration settings (e.g., base URL, browser settings).\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_until`, `retry`) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing**: Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures, such as stale element references or network timeouts. This could involve refreshing the page, retrying the action, or using alternative locators.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test. Avoid using implicit waits, as they can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n    *   **Robust Locators**: Use robust locators (e.g., IDs, ARIA attributes) that are less likely to change. Avoid using fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**: Focus on the following pages/flows for initial exploration and test case creation:\n    1.  **Login Page**: `https://www.saucedemo.com/`\n    2.  **Product Catalog Page**: `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html`\n    3.  **Cart Page**: `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html`\n    4.  **Checkout Pages**: `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-one.html`, `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html`, `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-complete.html`\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Success**:\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n        *   Relevant page elements are visible (e.g., \"Products\" heading on the product catalog page, \"Checkout: Your Information\" heading on the checkout page).\n        *   Expected data is displayed correctly (e.g., product prices, cart totals).\n        *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n    *   **Failure**:\n        *   HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500).\n        *   Unexpected exceptions or errors.\n        *   Incorrect data or calculations.\n        *   Missing or broken UI elements.\n        *   JavaScript errors.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing the Saucedemo e-commerce application. It will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the project."
