  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo.com is an e-commerce platform, albeit a demo one. The core business functionality revolves around product browsing, adding to cart, and checkout.\n*   **Risk Profile:** While this is a demo site, a failure in core functionality (login, add to cart, checkout) would indicate a critical system failure. The primary risk is a broken build that prevents users from completing basic actions.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   User Login (standard\\_user)\n        *   Product Catalog (Sorting by Price)\n        *   Shopping Cart (Adding Items)\n        *   Checkout Process\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Negative Login Scenarios (Invalid Credentials)\n        *   Detailed Product Filtering\n        *   Payment Gateway Integration (as it's a demo)\n        *   Edge Cases (e.g., extremely large quantities)\n        *   UI/UX validation (beyond basic element presence)\n        *   Performance Testing\n        *   Security Testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the core \"happy path\" functionality of Saucedemo.com.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the system's health after a build or deployment.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  Navigate to Saucedemo.com\n        2.  Login with `standard_user` and `secret_sauce`\n        3.  Verify successful login (e.g., inventory page is displayed)\n        4.  Sort products by price (low to high)\n        5.  Add the lowest-priced item to the cart\n        6.  Navigate to the shopping cart\n        7.  Verify the correct item is in the cart\n        8.  Proceed to checkout\n        9.  Enter valid checkout information (First Name, Last Name, Postal Code - use dummy data)\n        10. Complete the checkout process\n        11. Verify successful order completion (e.g., \"Thank you for your order\" message)\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use the provided `standard_user` credentials.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Generate dummy data for checkout information (First Name, Last Name, Postal Code). This can be achieved using libraries like Faker.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application (LoginPage, InventoryPage, CartPage, CheckoutPage, etc.). This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Language:**  [Choose your preferred language, e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript]\n    *   **Test Framework:** [Choose your preferred framework, e.g., JUnit, pytest, Mocha]\n    *   **Assertion Library:** [Choose your preferred assertion library, e.g., AssertJ, Chai]\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with explicit waits) to handle asynchronous loading of elements.  For example, wait for an element to be visible before interacting with it.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  If a test fails, retry it a maximum of 2-3 times before marking it as a failure.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Basic):**\n        *   Implement basic self-healing by locating elements using multiple locators (e.g., ID, CSS Selector, XPath). If one locator fails, try the others.  This is especially useful for handling minor UI changes.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Verify login functionality.\n    2.  **Inventory Page:** `/inventory.html` (after login) - Verify product display and sorting.\n    3.  **Cart Page:** `/cart.html` - Verify adding and viewing items in the cart.\n    4.  **Checkout Pages:** `/checkout-step-one.html`, `/checkout-step-two.html`, `/checkout-complete.html` - Verify the checkout process.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of key elements on each page (e.g., \"Products\" heading on the Inventory page, \"Checkout: Your Information\" heading on the checkout page).\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify specific text on pages (e.g., \"Thank you for your order\" on the confirmation page).\n    *   **Redirection:** Verify correct redirection after login and checkout.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate clear and concise test reports indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots or videos of failed tests to aid in debugging.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust smoke test suite for Saucedemo.com. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves."
