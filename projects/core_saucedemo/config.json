  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo.com is an e-commerce platform, albeit a demo one. Core functionality revolves around product browsing, adding to cart, and checkout.\n*   **Risk Profile:** While a demo site, failure of core functions (login, add to cart, checkout) would indicate a critical system failure. The primary risk is a broken build that prevents basic user flows.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Login with a valid user (\"standard_user\").\n        *   Product catalog display.\n        *   Product sorting by price (low to high).\n        *   Adding a low-priced item to the cart.\n        *   Checkout process (single item, standard flow).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials).\n        *   Detailed product page testing (reviews, descriptions).\n        *   Filtering products.\n        *   Adding multiple items to the cart.\n        *   Coupon codes.\n        *   Payment gateway integration (as it's a demo).\n        *   Shipping options.\n        *   Error handling beyond basic success/failure.\n        *   UI/UX visual testing.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Overall Approach:** This is a *Smoke Test* strategy. We aim to verify the most critical path through the application. If any of these tests fail, the build is considered broken and should be rejected.\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Successful Login**\n        *   Navigate to the login page.\n        *   Enter valid credentials for \"standard_user\".\n        *   Verify successful login and redirection to the product catalog page.\n    *   **Test Case 2: Add Lowest Price Item & Checkout**\n        *   Sort products by price (low to high).\n        *   Add the first (lowest priced) item to the cart.\n        *   Navigate to the cart.\n        *   Initiate the checkout process.\n        *   Enter valid shipping information.\n        *   Complete the checkout process.\n        *   Verify successful order confirmation.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for this Smoke Test strategy.* A full regression suite would be defined separately.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use the pre-defined \"standard_user\" credentials.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** No dynamic data generation is required for this smoke test.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Essential for maintainability. Create Page Objects for:\n        *   LoginPage\n        *   ProductCatalogPage\n        *   ShoppingCartPage\n        *   CheckoutPage\n        *   ConfirmationPage\n    *   **Language:**  [Choose language - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript] with a suitable testing framework (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Playwright).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use explicit waits with polling to handle asynchronous loading of elements (e.g., product prices, cart updates).  Avoid hardcoded `Thread.sleep()`.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., retry a test 1-2 times before failing).\n    *   **Self-Healing (Basic):**\n        *   Implement robust element locators (e.g., use IDs, or combine multiple attributes).\n        *   Consider using relative locators (e.g., \"find the button next to the 'Price' label\").\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Focus Areas):**\n    1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Verify login functionality.\n    2.  **Product Catalog Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html` - Verify product display and sorting.\n    3.  **Cart Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html` - Verify adding to cart functionality.\n    4.  **Checkout Pages:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-one.html`, `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html`, `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-complete.html` - Verify checkout flow.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Successful Login:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code on redirection to the product catalog page.\n        *   Presence of the product catalog container element.\n    *   **Product Sorting:**\n        *   Verify that the product list is sorted correctly by price (low to high).\n    *   **Add to Cart:**\n        *   The cart icon in the header should display \"1\" (indicating one item in the cart).\n        *   The item should be visible in the cart page.\n    *   **Checkout Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code on the confirmation page (`https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-complete.html`).\n        *   Presence of the \"Thank you for your order!\" text on the confirmation page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the engineering team to implement a robust smoke test suite for Saucedemo.com. It emphasizes critical functionality and provides guidance on architecture and execution. Remember to adapt this strategy as the application evolves and testing needs change."
