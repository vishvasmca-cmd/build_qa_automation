  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo E-Commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Saucedemo e-commerce application, focusing on a risk-based approach to ensure comprehensive test coverage and efficient execution. This strategy will guide the entire engineering team, including Senior QAs, Test Architects, and SDETs, in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo is an e-commerce platform. In this domain, the following areas are considered critical:\n\n*   **Authentication:** User login and access to the system.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying and searching for products.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and modifying items in the cart.\n*   **Checkout & Payments:** Completing the purchase process.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure in any of the critical areas can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders and generate revenue.\n*   **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Frustration due to inability to purchase products.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception of the brand due to system failures.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Smoke Tests:** Critical path scenarios to ensure core functionality is working.\n*   **Regression Tests:** Comprehensive tests to validate existing functionality after changes.\n*   **Functional Tests:** Tests to verify that the application behaves as expected.\n*   **UI Tests:** Tests to ensure the user interface is displaying correctly.\n*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility Tests:** Tests to ensure the application works across different browsers.\n\n**Out of Scope (For Initial Phase):**\n\n*   **Performance Testing:** Load, stress, and endurance testing.\n*   **Security Testing:** Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning.\n*   **Accessibility Testing:** Testing for compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG).\n*   **Localization Testing:** Testing for different languages and regions.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will serve as a \"health check\" to ensure the application is in a stable state.\n\n*   **Goal:** Verify the core functionality of the application.\n*   **Frequency:** Executed after each build deployment.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   **Login:**\n        *   Successful login with a valid user (e.g., `standard_user`).\n    *   **Product Catalog:**\n        *   Loading of the main product page.\n    *   **Shopping Cart:**\n        *   Adding a product to the cart.\n    *   **Checkout:**\n        *   Initiating the checkout process.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Goal:** Ensure that new changes have not introduced any regressions.\n*   **Frequency:** Executed after each sprint or major release.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   **Authentication:**\n        *   Login with invalid credentials.\n        *   Password reset flow.\n        *   Account lockout scenarios.\n    *   **Product Catalog:**\n        *   Filtering products by price and category.\n        *   Sorting products by price.\n        *   Searching for products.\n    *   **Shopping Cart:**\n        *   Updating the quantity of items in the cart.\n        *   Removing items from the cart.\n        *   Handling out-of-stock items.\n    *   **Checkout & Payments:**\n        *   Completing the checkout process with different payment methods.\n        *   Applying valid and invalid coupon codes.\n        *   Handling payment failures.\n        *   Validating tax and shipping calculations.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined user accounts, product information, and coupon codes.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generated data for scenarios such as creating new user accounts or generating unique order IDs.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a centralized location (e.g., CSV files, databases) and managed using data-driven testing techniques.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application will have a corresponding page object that encapsulates the elements and actions on that page.\n*   **Language:** Java or Python are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n*   **Test Runner:** JUnit or pytest.\n*   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ or Hamcrest.\n*   **Reporting:** Allure or ExtentReports.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to handle asynchronous operations.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common issues such as element locators changing.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism to automatically retry failed tests.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages and flows first:\n\n*   **Login Page:** `/`\n*   **Product Catalog Page:** `/inventory.html`\n*   **Product Details Page:** `/inventory-item.html?id=4` (Example Product)\n*   **Shopping Cart Page:** `/cart.html`\n*   **Checkout Pages:** `/checkout-step-one.html`, `/checkout-step-two.html`, `/checkout-complete.html`\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Login:** HTTP 200 AND \"Products\" text visible on the inventory page.\n*   **Product Page Load:** HTTP 200 AND Product names are visible.\n*   **Add to Cart:** HTTP 200 AND Cart icon shows \"1\" item.\n*   **Checkout Success:** HTTP 200 AND \"Thank you for your order!\" text visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the Saucedemo e-commerce application. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure that the application is thoroughly tested and meets the required quality standards."
