  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com (E-commerce)\n**Test Type:** Smoke\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo.com is an e-commerce platform. While a demo site, the principles apply. Checkout and core product browsing are critical.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionality (login, add to cart, checkout) directly impacts the ability to simulate sales and demonstrate the platform. This leads to a loss of confidence in the application.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Login with a valid user.\n        *   Product catalog browsing and sorting.\n        *   Adding a product to the cart.\n        *   Checkout process.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials).\n        *   Detailed product filtering.\n        *   Coupon code application.\n        *   Payment gateway integration (assumed to be mocked in this demo).\n        *   Edge cases (e.g., out-of-stock items).\n        *   UI/UX validation (beyond basic element presence).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the core, most critical path of the application is functional.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Login Success:** Login with `standard_user` and valid password.\n        2.  **Product Sort:** Sort products by price (low to high).\n        3.  **Add to Cart:** Add the lowest-priced item to the cart.\n        4.  **Checkout Completion:** Complete the checkout process with default shipping information.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not executed in this smoke test, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   **Authentication:**\n        *   Login with Invalid Password\n        *   Login with Locked Account\n        *   Password Reset Flow\n    *   **Product Catalog:**\n        *   Filter products by Price/Category\n        *   Sort products (Price High-Low)\n        *   Search for non-existent product\n    *   **Shopping Cart:**\n        *   Update Quantity in Cart\n        *   Remove Item from Cart\n        *   Add Out-of-Stock Item (Verify Error)\n    *   **Checkout & Payments:**\n        *   Checkout with formatted Address\n        *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code\n        *   Payment Decline Simulation\n        *   Calculate Tax/Shipping correctly\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use the `standard_user` credentials provided by the application.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** No dynamic data generation is required for this smoke test.  For future regression tests, consider using Faker libraries to generate realistic test data (e.g., names, addresses).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create Page Objects for:\n        *   LoginPage\n        *   InventoryPage (Product Catalog)\n        *   CartPage\n        *   CheckoutPage (Information, Overview, Completion)\n    *   **Technology Stack:**  Selenium WebDriver (or Cypress/Playwright), Python/Java/JavaScript (based on team expertise), pytest/JUnit/Mocha.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use explicit waits with polling to handle asynchronous loading of elements (e.g., wait for the cart to update).\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).  Limit retries to 1-2 times.\n        *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):**  Consider using techniques to automatically locate elements based on multiple attributes (e.g., ID, name, text) if the primary locator fails.\n    *   **Locator Strategy:**\n        *   Prioritize stable locators (IDs, unique attributes).\n        *   Use CSS selectors or XPath as a fallback.\n        *   Avoid brittle locators that rely on text content that might change.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Exploration Order):**\n    1.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/`: Login Page\n    2.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html`: Inventory Page (after successful login)\n    3.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html`: Shopping Cart\n    4.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-one.html`: Checkout Information\n    5.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html`: Checkout Overview\n    6.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-complete.html`: Checkout Completion\n*   **Verification Criteria (Success Definition):**\n    *   **Login Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code on `inventory.html`.\n        *   Presence of the \"Products\" header on the Inventory Page.\n    *   **Product Sort:**\n        *   The first product displayed on the Inventory Page has the lowest price.\n    *   **Add to Cart:**\n        *   The cart icon in the header displays \"1\".\n        *   Navigating to `cart.html` shows the selected product.\n    *   **Checkout Completion:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code on `checkout-complete.html`.\n        *   Presence of the \"Thank you for your order!\" text on the Checkout Completion Page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing the smoke test and sets the foundation for future regression testing efforts. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves."
