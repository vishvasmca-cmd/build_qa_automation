  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (smoke). This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** Saucedemo.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business functionality revolves around product browsing, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process. Failure in these areas directly impacts the user experience and the perceived reliability of the platform.\n\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Given that this is a smoke test, the primary risk is a complete system outage or failure of core functionality. This could lead to:\n    *   **Loss of User Trust:** If users cannot access the site or complete basic actions, they will likely abandon the platform.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Public perception of the platform's reliability will be negatively affected.\n\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   User Login (with `standard_user`)\n        *   Product Catalog Loading and Display\n        *   Product Sorting (by price - low to high)\n        *   Adding a low-cost item to the cart\n        *   Viewing the cart\n        *   Checkout process (single item, happy path)\n        *   Order Confirmation\n\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials)\n        *   Detailed product filtering and search\n        *   Multiple item cart scenarios\n        *   Payment gateway integration (mocked or stubbed)\n        *   Shipping calculations\n        *   Coupon codes\n        *   User registration\n        *   Password reset\n        *   Edge cases (e.g., out-of-stock items)\n        *   UI/UX validation (beyond basic element presence)\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a single, primary browser)\n        *   Performance testing\n        *   Security testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n    *   **Definition:** A minimal set of tests to verify the core functionality of Saucedemo.com is operational.\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After every build/deployment.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** All smoke tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Login:** Successfully log in with the `standard_user` credentials.\n        2.  **Product Load:** Verify that the product catalog loads and displays products.\n        3.  **Sort Products:** Sort the products by price (low to high) and verify the order.\n        4.  **Add to Cart:** Add the lowest-priced item to the cart.\n        5.  **View Cart:** Verify the item is present in the cart.\n        6.  **Checkout:** Complete the checkout process with the added item.\n        7.  **Order Confirmation:** Verify the order confirmation page is displayed.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Future Expansion):**\n    *   **Definition:** A comprehensive suite of tests to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality. This will be developed *after* the smoke tests are stable.\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** Scheduled nightly or weekly, and before major releases.\n    *   **Scope (Future):** Will include all areas currently \"Out of Scope\" above, plus:\n        *   Negative testing (invalid inputs, error handling)\n        *   Boundary value analysis\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility\n        *   Performance testing\n        *   Security testing\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Approach:** Static test data for the smoke tests.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   **Username:** `standard_user`\n        *   **Password:** `secret_sauce`\n        *   Product selection: Dynamically identify the lowest-priced item on the page. This avoids hardcoding a specific product name, which could change.\n        *   Address information: Use a pre-defined, valid address for the checkout process.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   **Structure:**\n        *   Base Page: Contains common methods (e.g., `openPage()`, `getTitle()`).\n        *   Page Objects: Separate classes for each page (e.g., `LoginPage`, `ProductsPage`, `CartPage`, `CheckoutPage`). Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n        *   Test Cases: Reside in separate classes and use the Page Objects to interact with the application.\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them. Avoid implicit waits.\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** For elements that may take time to update (e.g., cart count), use polling assertions (retry assertions with a short delay) to avoid false failures.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for critical actions (e.g., adding to cart, clicking a button) that may occasionally fail due to network issues or temporary server instability.\n        *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI to identify elements based on multiple attributes) to mitigate failures caused by minor UI changes.  This is a longer-term goal.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Initial Focus):**\n\n    1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Verify login functionality.\n    2.  **Products Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html` (after successful login) - Verify product loading and sorting.\n    3.  **Cart Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html` - Verify item addition and display.\n    4.  **Checkout Pages:**\n        *   `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-one.html`\n        *   `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html`\n        *   `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-complete.html` - Verify checkout process.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    *   **General:**\n        *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return a 200 OK status code.\n        *   **Element Presence:** Verify that key elements (e.g., login button, product names, cart icon) are present on the page.\n    *   **Specific:**\n        *   **Login:** After login, verify that the URL changes to `/inventory.html` and that the product list is displayed.\n        *   **Product Sorting:** Verify that the products are sorted correctly by price (low to high).\n        *   **Add to Cart:** Verify that the cart icon displays \"1\" after adding an item.\n        *   **Checkout:** Verify that the order confirmation page displays a success message (e.g., \"Thank you for your order!\").\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for building a robust smoke test suite for Saucedemo.com. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical functionalities and incorporating resilience strategies to minimize flakiness. This document will be updated as the testing effort evolves and expands to include regression testing and more advanced techniques."
