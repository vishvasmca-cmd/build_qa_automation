  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke). This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo.com is an E-commerce platform. The core business functionality revolves around product browsing, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process.  Checkout and Login are the most critical areas.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure in the core flows (Login, Add to Cart, Checkout) can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user experience leading to loss of customer trust.\n*   **Operational Disruption:**  Inability to fulfill orders.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Login with a standard user.\n    *   Product catalog browsing and sorting.\n    *   Adding a low-cost item to the cart.\n    *   Checkout process completion.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials).\n    *   Detailed product filtering and sorting variations.\n    *   Cart manipulation edge cases (e.g., adding large quantities).\n    *   Payment gateway integration testing (simulated payment is sufficient for smoke).\n    *   UI/UX visual testing.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will focus on verifying the core \"happy path\" functionality. If any of these tests fail, the build is considered unstable and should be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Successful Login:** Verify that a user can log in with valid credentials (`standard_user`).\n    2.  **Product Sort:** Verify that products can be sorted by price (low to high).\n    3.  **Add to Cart:** Verify that a low-cost item can be added to the cart.\n    4.  **Checkout Completion:** Verify that the checkout process can be completed successfully with the added item.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*N/A - This is a Smoke Test Strategy. Regression tests will be defined in a separate document.*\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Test Data:** Use the provided `standard_user` credentials. The low-cost item should be determined dynamically (find the lowest price on the page).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n\n    *   Example:\n        *   `LoginPage`\n        *   `InventoryPage`\n        *   `CartPage`\n        *   `CheckoutPage`\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., network issues).  Limit retries to a maximum of 2-3 to avoid masking genuine issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Exploration Order)\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages/flows in the specified order:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Focus on the login form.\n2.  **Inventory Page:** (Post-login) - Focus on product listing and sorting functionality.\n3.  **Product Detail Page:** (After selecting a low-cost item) - Verify product details.\n4.  **Cart Page:** (After adding to cart) - Verify item in the cart.\n5.  **Checkout Pages:** (Information, Overview, Completion) - Focus on completing the checkout process.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **General Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   No unhandled exceptions or errors in the browser console.\n*   **Specific Success Criteria:**\n    *   **Login:**  After successful login, the Inventory Page should load, and the URL should contain `/inventory.html`.\n    *   **Product Sort:** After sorting by price (low to high), the first product displayed should have the lowest price among all products.\n    *   **Add to Cart:** After adding an item to the cart, the cart icon in the header should display the correct number of items (1 in this case).\n    *   **Checkout Completion:** After completing the checkout process, the \"Thank You\" page should load, and a confirmation message (e.g., \"Thank you for your order!\") should be displayed.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing Saucedemo.com. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the stability and reliability of the application's core functionality."
