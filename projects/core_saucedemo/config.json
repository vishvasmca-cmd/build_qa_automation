  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo.com is a demonstration e-commerce application. While not a live production environment, a failure in core functionality would misrepresent the capabilities of the platform and potentially impact user perception.\n*   **Risk Profile:** The primary risk is a misrepresentation of the application's functionality. This could lead to incorrect assumptions about the platform's capabilities.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Successful login with the `standard_user` account.\n        *   Product catalog display and sorting by price (low to high).\n        *   Adding the lowest-priced item to the shopping cart.\n        *   Completing the checkout process with valid data.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials, locked accounts).\n        *   Detailed product catalog filtering and searching.\n        *   Cart manipulation beyond adding a single item.\n        *   Payment gateway integration (as this is a demo site).\n        *   Edge cases in address validation.\n        *   UI/UX visual testing.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Overall Approach:** This smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the core \"happy path\" functionality of the application, ensuring that the fundamental user journey is operational.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly validate the stability and basic functionality of the application after deployment or code changes.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Login Success:**\n            *   Navigate to the login page.\n            *   Enter username: `standard_user`\n            *   Enter password: `secret_sauce`\n            *   Click \"Login\" button.\n            *   Verify successful login by checking for the presence of the product catalog page.\n        2.  **Sort and Add to Cart:**\n            *   Sort products by price (low to high).\n            *   Add the lowest-priced item to the cart.\n            *   Verify the item is added to the cart.\n        3.  **Checkout Success:**\n            *   Navigate to the cart.\n            *   Click \"Checkout\".\n            *   Enter valid first name, last name, and postal code.\n            *   Click \"Continue\".\n            *   Click \"Finish\".\n            *   Verify successful order completion by checking for the \"Thank you for your order!\" message.\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for this Smoke Test Strategy.* A regression suite would be defined separately to cover a broader range of scenarios.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use the provided `standard_user` credentials directly in the test scripts.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** For checkout information (first name, last name, postal code), use hardcoded valid data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n        *   Example: `LoginPage`, `ProductsPage`, `CartPage`, `CheckoutPage`, `CheckoutOverviewPage`, `CheckoutCompletePage`.\n    *   **Test Framework:** Choose a suitable test framework (e.g., Selenium with JUnit/TestNG, Cypress, Playwright) based on team expertise and project requirements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to wait for specific elements to be present or interactable before performing actions.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests, especially those involving network requests or UI rendering.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Verify login functionality.\n    2.  **Products Page:** `/inventory.html` - Verify product sorting and add-to-cart functionality.\n    3.  **Cart Page:** `/cart.html` - Verify cart contents.\n    4.  **Checkout Pages:** `/checkout-step-one.html`, `/checkout-step-two.html`, `/checkout-complete.html` - Verify checkout process.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of key elements on each page (e.g., \"Products\" header on the products page, \"Checkout: Overview\" header on the checkout overview page).\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify the presence of specific text strings (e.g., \"Thank you for your order!\" on the checkout complete page).\n    *   **Cart Count:** Verify that the cart count updates correctly after adding an item.\n    *   **Redirection:** Verify correct redirection between pages during the login and checkout flows.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the core functionality of Saucedemo.com. It will help ensure that the application is stable and functioning as expected. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as needed based on the evolving requirements of the project."
