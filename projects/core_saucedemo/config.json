  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com (E-commerce)\n**Test Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo.com is an e-commerce demo application. While not a real-world revenue-generating platform, its functionality mirrors critical aspects of e-commerce systems.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities (login, product display, cart, checkout) would indicate a severe system issue, preventing users from completing essential tasks. This could lead to a perception of unreliability and potential loss of user trust (if it were a real application).\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   User Login (with `standard_user`)\n        *   Product Catalog Display\n        *   Product Sorting (by price - low to high)\n        *   Adding a single, low-cost item to the shopping cart\n        *   Checkout process (single item)\n        *   Successful order placement\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials, locked accounts)\n        *   Detailed product catalog filtering and searching\n        *   Adding multiple items to the cart\n        *   Updating quantities in the cart\n        *   Removing items from the cart\n        *   Payment gateway integration (assumed successful in this smoke test)\n        *   Shipping calculations\n        *   Tax calculations\n        *   Coupon codes\n        *   User registration\n        *   Order history\n        *   Mobile responsiveness\n        *   Accessibility testing\n        *   Performance testing\n        *   Security testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To verify the core functionality of the application is operational after deployment or code changes.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Login:** Navigate to the login page, enter `standard_user` credentials, and verify successful login (redirect to product catalog page).\n        2.  **Sort Products:** Verify products can be sorted by price (low to high).\n        3.  **Add to Cart:** Add the lowest-priced item to the cart.\n        4.  **Checkout:** Navigate to the cart, initiate the checkout process, enter required shipping information, and complete the order.\n        5.  **Order Confirmation:** Verify successful order placement (confirmation message/page).\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not executed in this smoke test, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   This suite would cover all the \"Out of Scope\" items listed above, plus more detailed testing of the \"In Scope\" items.\n    *   It would include:\n        *   Negative login tests\n        *   Multiple items in the cart\n        *   Quantity updates\n        *   Payment variations\n        *   Address validation\n        *   Error handling\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use the provided `standard_user` credentials.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** The lowest-priced item can be dynamically identified during test execution by parsing the product catalog page. Shipping information can be hardcoded for this smoke test (e.g., \"First Name\", \"Last Name\", \"Zip Code\").\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create Page Objects for:\n        *   LoginPage\n        *   ProductCatalogPage\n        *   ShoppingCartPage\n        *   CheckoutPage\n        *   ConfirmationPage\n    *   This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) to handle potential timing issues.  Avoid hardcoded `Thread.sleep()` calls.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., retry a test 1-2 times before failing).\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and log meaningful error messages.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Verify login functionality.\n    2.  **Product Catalog Page:** (After successful login) - Verify product display and sorting.\n    3.  **Shopping Cart Page:** (After adding an item) - Verify cart summary.\n    4.  **Checkout Page:** (After proceeding to checkout) - Verify checkout form and order placement.\n    5.  **Confirmation Page:** (After order placement) - Verify order confirmation.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Login:** Successful redirect to the Product Catalog Page.\n    *   **Product Catalog:** Products are sorted by price (low to high).\n    *   **Add to Cart:** The selected item is present in the shopping cart.\n    *   **Checkout:** Order is successfully placed.\n    *   **Order Confirmation:** A confirmation message or page is displayed indicating successful order placement.\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** All page requests should return HTTP 200 (OK).\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Key elements (e.g., product names, prices, buttons) should be visible and interactable.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing the smoke test on Saucedemo.com. It outlines the scope, strategy, architecture, and execution guidelines to ensure the core functionality of the application is working as expected."
