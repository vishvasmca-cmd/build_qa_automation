  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com (E-commerce)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo.com is a demonstration e-commerce application. While not a real-world revenue-generating platform, its functionality mirrors critical aspects of e-commerce systems.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities (login, product display, cart, checkout) would indicate a severe system issue, potentially blocking all user activity. The risk is primarily related to system availability and basic functionality.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   User Login (standard\\_user)\n        *   Product Catalog Display\n        *   Product Sorting (Price - Low to High)\n        *   Adding a low-cost item to the cart\n        *   Checkout process (single item)\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials)\n        *   Detailed product filtering\n        *   Multiple item cart scenarios\n        *   Payment gateway integration (assumed to be stubbed)\n        *   Edge cases (e.g., inventory management, promotions)\n        *   UI/UX validation (beyond basic element presence)\n        *   Performance testing\n        *   Security testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Overall Approach:** This smoke test aims to validate the core \"happy path\" of a user logging in, finding a product, adding it to the cart, and completing the checkout process. It's designed to be a quick and efficient health check.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite:**\n    1.  **Login:**\n        *   Navigate to the login page.\n        *   Enter username \"standard\\_user\".\n        *   Enter password \"secret\\_sauce\".\n        *   Click \"Login\".\n        *   Verify successful login by checking for the presence of the product catalog page.\n    2.  **Product Sorting:**\n        *   Select \"Price (low to high)\" from the sort dropdown.\n        *   Verify that the products are sorted correctly (at least the first few products).\n    3.  **Add to Cart:**\n        *   Identify the lowest-priced item.\n        *   Click the \"Add to Cart\" button for that item.\n        *   Verify that the cart icon in the header now displays \"1\".\n    4.  **Checkout:**\n        *   Click the cart icon.\n        *   Click the \"Checkout\" button.\n        *   Enter First Name, Last Name, and Postal Code.\n        *   Click \"Continue\".\n        *   Verify the order summary page is displayed.\n        *   Click \"Finish\".\n        *   Verify the \"Thank You\" confirmation message is displayed.\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not executed in this smoke test, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   N/A - Smoke test only.  A full regression suite would cover all the \"Out of Scope\" items listed above.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** The username (\"standard\\_user\") and password (\"secret\\_sauce\") are hardcoded and known.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** First Name, Last Name, and Postal Code for checkout can be any valid string.  Consider using a simple, consistent value for these fields (e.g., \"Test\", \"User\", \"12345\").\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM) is highly recommended. This will improve maintainability and readability.\n    *   Create Page Objects for:\n        *   LoginPage\n        *   InventoryPage (Product Catalog)\n        *   CartPage\n        *   CheckoutInformationPage\n        *   CheckoutOverviewPage\n        *   CheckoutCompletePage\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait-until) when verifying UI changes (e.g., cart icon update). This helps avoid flakiness due to timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts (e.g., 5-10 seconds) for elements to become visible or interactable.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for critical steps (e.g., login, add to cart) to handle transient errors.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  `/` (Root - Login Page)\n    2.  `/inventory.html` (Product Catalog Page)\n    3.  `/cart.html` (Cart Page)\n    4.  `/checkout-step-one.html` (Checkout Information Page)\n    5.  `/checkout-step-two.html` (Checkout Overview Page)\n    6.  `/checkout-complete.html` (Checkout Complete Page)\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** All pages should return HTTP 200 (OK).\n    *   **Element Presence:** Key elements on each page must be present (e.g., Login button on the Login Page, Product Names on the Inventory Page, Checkout button on the Cart Page, etc.).\n    *   **Text Verification:** Specific text elements should be verified (e.g., \"Products\" heading on the Inventory Page, \"Thank you for your order!\" on the Checkout Complete Page).\n    *   **Functional Verification:** The core actions (login, sort, add to cart, checkout) must complete successfully without errors.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing the smoke test on Saucedemo.com. It prioritizes critical functionality and sets the foundation for future, more comprehensive testing efforts."
