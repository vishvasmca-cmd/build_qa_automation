  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo E-Commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Saucedemo e-commerce application, ensuring a robust and reliable testing approach. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding test automation and execution efforts.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo is an e-commerce platform. The core business functions revolve around product browsing, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process. Failure in these areas directly impacts the user experience and potential revenue.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failures can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders.\n    *   **Reputation Damage:** Negative user experience due to bugs.\n    *   **Lost Productivity:** Time spent troubleshooting issues.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Authentication (Login)\n        *   Product Catalog (Sorting)\n        *   Shopping Cart (Adding Items)\n        *   Checkout & Payments (Completion)\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed UI/UX testing (e.g., pixel-perfect rendering)\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress)\n        *   Security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning)\n        *   Accessibility testing\n        *   Localization testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a smoke test suite to validate the core functionality of the application.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Definition:** A minimal set of tests to verify the system's most critical functions are working after a build or deployment.\n    *   **Goal:** Quickly identify major issues that would prevent further testing.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Login with `standard_user`:** Verify successful login.\n        2.  **Sort Products by Price (Low to High):** Verify products are sorted correctly.\n        3.  **Add Lowest Price Item to Cart:** Verify item is added to the cart.\n        4.  **Complete Checkout:** Verify successful order placement.\n*   **Regression Suite (Future):**\n    *   **Definition:** A comprehensive suite of tests ensuring that recent changes have not broken existing functionality.\n    *   **Goal:** Maintain the stability of the application as new features are added or existing ones are modified.\n    *   **Test Cases (Examples):**\n        *   Login with Invalid Password\n        *   Filter products by Category\n        *   Update Quantity in Cart\n        *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use predefined user credentials (`standard_user`) for login.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically identify the lowest-priced item during test execution to avoid hardcoding product names or prices.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `LoginPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the login page.\n        *   `ProductsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the products page (sorting, adding to cart).\n        *   `CartPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the shopping cart.\n        *   `CheckoutPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the checkout process.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable, especially after actions that trigger asynchronous updates.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits and use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page (`/`)**: Focus on the login form and error handling.\n    2.  **Products Page (`/inventory.html`)**: Focus on product sorting and adding items to the cart.\n    3.  **Cart Page (`/cart.html`)**: Focus on cart summary and checkout button.\n    4.  **Checkout Pages (`/checkout-step-one.html`, `/checkout-step-two.html`, `/checkout-complete.html`)**: Focus on address input, payment information, and order confirmation.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Login Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND redirection to the products page (`/inventory.html`) AND presence of a \"Products\" heading.\n    *   **Sorting Success:** Verify that the products are sorted correctly by price (low to high).\n    *   **Add to Cart Success:** Verify that the item is added to the cart and the cart icon displays the correct number of items.\n    *   **Checkout Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND redirection to the order confirmation page (`/checkout-complete.html`) AND presence of a \"Thank you for your order!\" message."
