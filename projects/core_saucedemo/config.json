  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com (E-commerce)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business function is enabling users to purchase products. Therefore, the checkout process is of *critical* importance (P0).\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities (login, product display, add to cart, checkout) leads to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders.\n    *   **Reputation Damage:** Negative user experience and potential loss of customer trust.\n    *   **Operational Disruption:** Inability to fulfill orders.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Login with a standard user.\n        *   Product catalog display.\n        *   Sorting products by price.\n        *   Adding a low-cost item to the cart.\n        *   Checkout process (single item, standard user).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials, locked account).\n        *   Detailed product filtering and advanced search.\n        *   Cart manipulation beyond adding a single item.\n        *   Payment gateway integration (simulated payment is acceptable for smoke).\n        *   Shipping calculations.\n        *   Tax calculations.\n        *   Coupon codes.\n        *   User registration.\n        *   Order history.\n        *   Customer support features.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic authentication).\n        *   Accessibility testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Overall Approach:** This smoke test aims to verify the *essential* functionality of the application. It's a \"health check\" to ensure the system is in a usable state. If any of these tests fail, the build should be rejected.\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Successful Login**\n        *   Navigate to the login page.\n        *   Enter valid credentials for `standard_user`.\n        *   Verify successful login and redirection to the product catalog page.\n    *   **Test Case 2: Product Sorting & Add to Cart**\n        *   On the product catalog page, sort products by price (low to high).\n        *   Add the lowest-priced item to the cart.\n        *   Verify the item is added to the cart successfully.\n    *   **Test Case 3: Checkout Completion**\n        *   Navigate to the cart.\n        *   Proceed to checkout.\n        *   Enter valid shipping information (first name, last name, postal code - use dummy data).\n        *   Complete the checkout process.\n        *   Verify successful order submission and confirmation message.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not executed in this smoke test, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   Login with Invalid Password\n    *   Login with Locked Account\n    *   Password Reset Flow\n    *   Registration with Existing Email\n    *   Filter products by Price/Category\n    *   Sort products (Price Low-High)\n    *   Search for non-existent product\n    *   Verify Pagination\n    *   Update Quantity in Cart\n    *   Remove Item from Cart\n    *   Add Out-of-Stock Item (Verify Error)\n    *   Cart Persistence (Refresh Page)\n    *   Checkout with formatted Address\n    *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code\n    *   Payment Decline Simulation\n    *   Calculate Tax/Shipping correctly\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Login Credentials:** Use the pre-defined `standard_user` credentials provided by Saucedemo.\n    *   **Shipping Information:** Use static, valid-formatted dummy data for shipping details (e.g., First Name: \"John\", Last Name: \"Doe\", Postal Code: \"12345\").  This avoids dependency on external data sources.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM) is highly recommended.\n    *   **Rationale:** POM promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability. It encapsulates page elements and interactions, making tests more resilient to UI changes.\n    *   **Structure:**\n        *   `LoginPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the login page.\n        *   `ProductCatalogPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the product catalog page (including sorting).\n        *   `CartPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the shopping cart.\n        *   `CheckoutPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the checkout process.\n        *   `CheckoutOverviewPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the checkout overview page.\n        *   `CheckoutCompletePage`: Contains elements and methods related to the checkout complete page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(...))`) to handle potential timing issues and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits instead of implicit waits for better control and predictability.\n    *   **Element Locators:** Use robust element locators (e.g., `data-test` attributes) that are less likely to change with UI updates.  Avoid relying solely on CSS selectors or XPaths that are prone to breakage.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., retry failed tests up to 2 times).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page (`/`)**:  Focus on identifying the username and password input fields, and the login button.\n    2.  **Product Catalog Page (`/inventory.html`)**: Focus on the product sorting dropdown, product names, product prices, and \"Add to Cart\" buttons.\n    3.  **Cart Page (`/cart.html`)**: Focus on the item name, quantity, and \"Checkout\" button.\n    4.  **Checkout Information Page (`/checkout-step-one.html`)**: Focus on the first name, last name, postal code input fields, and the \"Continue\" button.\n    5.  **Checkout Overview Page (`/checkout-step-two.html`)**: Focus on the item name, price, and \"Finish\" button.\n    6.  **Checkout Complete Page (`/checkout-complete.html`)**: Focus on the success message.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** All page requests should return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Login Success:** After submitting valid credentials, the user should be redirected to the `/inventory.html` page.\n    *   **Product Sorting:** Products should be displayed in ascending order of price after sorting.\n    *   **Add to Cart Success:** The cart icon should display the correct number of items after adding an item to the cart.\n    *   **Checkout Success:** After completing the checkout process, the user should be redirected to the `/checkout-complete.html` page and see a success message (e.g., \"Thank you for your order!\").\n*   **Execution Environment:** Execute the tests in a consistent and reliable environment (e.g., a dedicated test environment or a cloud-based testing platform like Sauce Labs).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing the smoke tests on Saucedemo.com. It emphasizes critical functionality, risk mitigation, and a structured approach to test automation. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves."
