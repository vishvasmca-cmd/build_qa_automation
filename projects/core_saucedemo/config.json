  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo E-Commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Saucedemo e-commerce application, ensuring a robust and reliable testing approach. This strategy focuses on a risk-based approach, prioritizing critical functionalities and establishing a clear framework for test automation and execution.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The application falls under the E-commerce domain. The core business functions revolve around product browsing, shopping cart management, and checkout. Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High Risk:** Checkout process failures (payment processing, order placement) leading to financial loss and customer dissatisfaction. Authentication failures preventing users from accessing the application.\n    *   **Medium Risk:** Product catalog issues (incorrect pricing, missing descriptions) leading to inaccurate information and potential customer frustration. Shopping cart errors (incorrect quantities, inability to remove items) leading to order discrepancies.\n    *   **Low Risk:** Minor UI inconsistencies or non-critical error messages.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Authentication (Login)\n        *   Product Catalog (Browsing, Sorting)\n        *   Shopping Cart (Adding Items, Viewing Cart)\n        *   Checkout & Payments (Order Placement)\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed UI/UX testing (pixel-perfect design)\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress) - to be addressed in a separate strategy.\n        *   Security testing (penetration testing) - to be addressed in a separate strategy.\n        *   Accessibility testing - to be addressed in a separate strategy.\n        *   Detailed error handling for edge cases (covered in Regression Strategy).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a Smoke test suite, as requested.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Definition:** A minimal set of tests to verify the core functionality of the application after each build or deployment.\n    *   **Goal:** Ensure the application is in a stable state and ready for further testing.\n    *   **Scope:**\n        *   **Login:** Successful login with a valid \"standard_user\" account.\n        *   **Product Catalog:** Verify product catalog page loads successfully.\n        *   **Sorting:** Verify products can be sorted by price (low to high).\n        *   **Add to Cart:** Add the lowest-priced item to the cart.\n        *   **Checkout:** Complete the checkout process with default shipping and payment information.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Static Data:** Use a predefined \"standard_user\" account with known credentials.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically identify the lowest-priced item during test execution.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** *This is not part of the current request, but included for completeness and future reference.*\n    *   **Definition:** A comprehensive suite of tests to ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions in existing functionality.\n    *   **Goal:** Maintain the stability and reliability of the application over time.\n    *   **Scope:** (Examples)\n        *   Authentication: Invalid login attempts, password reset flow.\n        *   Product Catalog: Filtering, searching for non-existent products.\n        *   Shopping Cart: Updating quantities, removing items, handling out-of-stock items.\n        *   Checkout & Payments: Applying coupon codes, simulating payment failures, validating address formats.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Use data generation techniques (e.g., Faker library) to create realistic test data for various scenarios.\n        *   **Data Pools:** Maintain pools of test data for different user roles, product categories, and payment methods.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to encapsulate page elements and interactions. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n        *   Each page in the application should have a corresponding Page Object class.\n        *   Page Objects should contain locators for elements on the page (e.g., login button, product name).\n        *   Page Objects should provide methods for interacting with elements on the page (e.g., clickLoginButton(), getProductName()).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures, such as element not found errors. This could involve retrying the action or using alternative locators.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. This will help to reduce the number of false positives.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Focus on the login form.\n    2.  **Inventory Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html` - Focus on product listing and sorting.\n    3.  **Cart Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html` - Focus on adding and viewing items.\n    4.  **Checkout Pages:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-one.html`, `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html`, `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-complete.html` - Focus on completing the checkout process.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Login Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND redirection to the inventory page AND presence of the \"Products\" header.\n    *   **Product Sorting:** Verify that the products are sorted correctly by price (low to high).\n    *   **Add to Cart Success:** Verify that the item is added to the cart AND the cart icon displays the correct quantity.\n    *   **Checkout Success:** Verify that the order is placed successfully AND the \"Thank you for your order!\" message is displayed. AND HTTP 200 status code."
