  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test automation framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo.com is a demonstration e-commerce platform. While not a live production environment, ensuring core functionality is critical for showcasing the platform's capabilities and stability.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities (login, product browsing, checkout) would misrepresent the platform's intended functionality, leading to a negative user experience for potential customers or learners.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   User Login (with `standard_user`)\n        *   Product Catalog display\n        *   Product Sorting (by price - low to high)\n        *   Adding a low-priced item to the cart\n        *   Checkout process (single item, happy path)\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials, locked accounts)\n        *   Extensive product catalog filtering and searching\n        *   Cart manipulation beyond adding a single item\n        *   Payment gateway integration (as it's a demo site)\n        *   Edge cases in address/shipping information\n        *   UI/UX visual validation (beyond basic element presence)\n        *   Performance testing\n        *   Security testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):** This suite will be the \"heartbeat\" of the application, executed on every build.\n\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Successful Login:** Verify that the `standard_user` can successfully log in to the application.\n        2.  **Product Catalog Load:** Verify that the product catalog page loads successfully after login.\n        3.  **Sort by Price (Low to High):** Verify that products can be sorted by price from low to high.\n        4.  **Add Low-Priced Item to Cart:** Verify that the lowest-priced item can be added to the shopping cart.\n        5.  **Checkout Completion:** Verify that the checkout process can be completed successfully with the selected item.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not the focus of this document, but considerations for future expansion)\n\n    *   This suite will be expanded later to cover more comprehensive scenarios.\n    *   It will include negative testing, boundary value analysis, and edge cases.\n    *   The regression suite will be triggered on a nightly basis or before major releases.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Static Data:** For the smoke tests, use the pre-defined `standard_user` credentials.\n    *   **Dynamic Data (Future):** For regression tests, consider using dynamic data generation for fields like addresses and names to avoid data conflicts.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n        *   Example: `LoginPage`, `InventoryPage`, `CartPage`, `CheckoutPage`.\n    *   **Language:** [Choose your preferred language, e.g., Java, Python, C#]\n    *   **Test Framework:** [Choose your preferred framework, e.g., JUnit, pytest, NUnit]\n    *   **Assertion Library:** [Choose your preferred library, e.g., AssertJ, Hamcrest, FluentAssertions]\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with explicit waits) to handle asynchronous operations and potential timing issues.  Instead of immediately failing, the test will retry the assertion for a specified duration.\n        *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):**  Explore self-healing techniques where the framework can automatically locate elements even if their locators change slightly.  This is a more advanced strategy and should be implemented carefully.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests (e.g., retry up to 2 times) to mitigate transient issues.\n    *   **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to capture detailed information about test execution, including timestamps, actions performed, and any errors encountered.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Initial Focus):**\n\n    1.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/`: Login Page\n    2.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html`: Inventory (Product Catalog) Page\n    3.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html`: Shopping Cart Page\n    4.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-one.html`: Checkout Step 1 (Information)\n    5.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html`: Checkout Step 2 (Overview)\n    6.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-complete.html`: Checkout Complete Page\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of key elements on each page (e.g., \"Products\" heading on the inventory page, \"Checkout: Overview\" heading on the checkout overview page).\n    *   **Text Verification:**\n        *   Login Success: Verify that after login, the page displays \"Products\" or a similar indicator of successful login.\n        *   Checkout Success: Verify that the final checkout page displays a success message (e.g., \"Thank you for your order!\").\n    *   **Sorting Verification:** After sorting, verify that the first product displayed has the lowest price.\n    *   **Cart Verification:** Verify that the correct item is added to the cart and that the cart summary displays the correct item and price.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust smoke test suite for Saucedemo.com. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and testing needs change. Good luck!"
