  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo E-Commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Saucedemo e-commerce application, ensuring a robust and reliable testing process. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding test automation and execution efforts.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo is an e-commerce platform. The core business functions revolve around product browsing, adding to cart, and completing the checkout process. Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and user experience.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failures can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user experience due to bugs and errors.\n    *   **Loss of Trust:** Users may abandon the platform if they encounter frequent issues.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Authentication (Login/Logout)\n        *   Product Catalog (Viewing, Sorting)\n        *   Shopping Cart (Adding, Removing, Updating)\n        *   Checkout & Payments (Order Placement)\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance Testing (Load, Stress) - *Initial focus is on functional correctness.*\n        *   Security Testing (Penetration, Vulnerability Scanning) - *Separate security assessment required.*\n        *   Accessibility Testing - *To be addressed in a later phase.*\n        *   Detailed UI/UX Testing - *Focus on core functionality first.*\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a risk-based approach, prioritizing critical functionalities and high-impact scenarios.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Definition:** A minimal set of tests to verify the core functionality of the application after each build.\n    *   **Goal:** Ensure the application is in a stable state for further testing.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Login with `standard_user`:** Verify successful login.\n        2.  **Product Catalog Load:** Verify product catalog page loads successfully.\n        3.  **Add Low-Cost Item to Cart:** Verify a low-cost item can be added to the cart.\n        4.  **Checkout Completion:** Verify the checkout process can be completed successfully.\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n    *   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** If any smoke test fails, the build is rejected.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Definition:** A comprehensive suite of tests to ensure that new changes haven't introduced regressions in existing functionality.\n    *   **Goal:** Maintain the stability and reliability of the application.\n    *   **Test Cases (Examples - to be expanded):**\n        *   **Authentication:**\n            *   Login with invalid credentials.\n            *   Logout functionality.\n        *   **Product Catalog:**\n            *   Sort products by price (high to low).\n            *   Filter products by category.\n            *   Search for a specific product.\n        *   **Shopping Cart:**\n            *   Update quantity of items in the cart.\n            *   Remove items from the cart.\n            *   Handle out-of-stock items.\n        *   **Checkout & Payments:**\n            *   Checkout with different shipping addresses.\n            *   Handle payment failures.\n            *   Verify order confirmation.\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After each sprint or major feature release.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:** User credentials (`standard_user`, `locked_out_user`, etc.) will be stored in a configuration file.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Product names, quantities, and shipping addresses will be dynamically generated or retrieved from a test data pool.\n    *   **Data Management:** A dedicated data management strategy will be implemented to ensure data integrity and avoid conflicts.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** This design pattern will be used to create reusable and maintainable test code. Each page of the application will be represented as a Page Object, encapsulating the elements and actions on that page.\n    *   **Language:** Python with pytest\n    *   **Libraries:** Selenium, Requests\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use explicit waits and polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues.\n        *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n    *   **Test Environment:**\n        *   A dedicated test environment that mirrors the production environment will be used.\n        *   Regular environment refreshes to ensure data consistency.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Focus on login functionality with different user roles.\n    2.  **Inventory Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html` - Focus on product listing, sorting, and filtering.\n    3.  **Cart Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html` - Focus on adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.\n    4.  **Checkout Pages:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-one.html`, `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html`, `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-complete.html` - Focus on the entire checkout flow, including address input, payment processing, and order confirmation.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Successful Login:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Products\" text visible on the inventory page.\n    *   **Product Added to Cart:** HTTP 200 status code AND the cart icon displays the correct number of items.\n    *   **Checkout Completion:** HTTP 200 status code AND \"Thank you for your order!\" text visible on the confirmation page.\n    *   **General:** Verify no JavaScript errors are present in the console.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing the Saucedemo e-commerce application. It will be reviewed and updated regularly to adapt to changing requirements and evolving risks."

  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (smoke).\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Saucedemo.com is an e-commerce platform.  The core business functionality revolves around product browsing, adding to cart, and checkout.  Checkout is the most critical function.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure in the core flows (login, add to cart, checkout) directly impacts revenue generation and user trust.  A failed login prevents access, a broken cart prevents purchases, and a failed checkout results in lost sales.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Login with a standard user.\n        *   Product catalog display and sorting.\n        *   Adding a single item to the cart.\n        *   Checkout process (single item, standard user).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   All negative testing (invalid credentials, etc.).\n        *   Multiple items in the cart.\n        *   Coupon codes.\n        *   Payment gateway integration (simulated success only).\n        *   Edge cases (out-of-stock, etc.).\n        *   UI/UX validation (visual appearance).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   API testing (except as needed to support UI flow).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Overall Approach:** This is a *smoke test* strategy.  The goal is to quickly verify the core functionality is operational.  If any of these tests fail, the build is considered broken and should be rejected.\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Login Success:** Navigate to the login page, enter valid credentials for `standard_user`, and verify successful login (redirect to product page).\n        2.  **Product Sort:** Verify products can be sorted by price (low to high).\n        3.  **Add to Cart:** Add the lowest-priced item to the cart.\n        4.  **Checkout Success:** Proceed to checkout with the selected item, enter valid shipping information, and complete the order (simulated success).\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for this smoke test strategy.* A full regression suite would be defined separately.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Test Data:** Use the pre-defined `standard_user` credentials provided by Saucedemo.  The lowest-priced item can be determined dynamically during test execution.\n    *   **No data creation or modification:** The tests should not create new users or modify existing data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended.  Create page objects for:\n        *   LoginPage\n        *   ProductsPage\n        *   CartPage\n        *   CheckoutPage (Information, Overview, Completion)\n    *   **Language:** [Choose your preferred language, e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript]\n    *   **Test Framework:** [Choose your preferred framework, e.g., JUnit, pytest, Mocha]\n    *   **Assertion Library:** [Choose your preferred library, e.g., AssertJ, Chai, Hamcrest]\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) to handle potential timing issues.  Avoid hard-coded waits.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests (e.g., retry a test up to 3 times).\n        *   **Element Identification:** Use robust element locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `aria-label`) that are less likely to change.  Avoid fragile locators like XPath based on position.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Optional):** Consider implementing basic self-healing capabilities (e.g., automatically re-login if the session expires).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  `/` (Login Page)\n    2.  `/inventory.html` (Products Page)\n    3.  `/cart.html` (Cart Page)\n    4.  `/checkout-step-one.html` (Checkout Information)\n    5.  `/checkout-step-two.html` (Checkout Overview)\n    6.  `/checkout-complete.html` (Checkout Completion)\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **General:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n        *   No JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n    *   **Specific:**\n        *   **Login Success:**  Verify the URL changes to `/inventory.html` and a welcome message or product list is displayed.\n        *   **Product Sort:** Verify the products are sorted correctly by price (low to high).\n        *   **Add to Cart:** Verify the cart icon in the header displays \"1\".\n        *   **Checkout Success:** Verify the URL changes to `/checkout-complete.html` and a success message (e.g., \"Thank you for your order!\") is displayed.\n*   **Execution Frequency:**  Run the smoke test suite on every build (Continuous Integration).\n*   **Reporting:**  Generate a clear and concise report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.  Alert the development team immediately if any tests fail."
