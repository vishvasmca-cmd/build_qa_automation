  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo E-Commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Saucedemo e-commerce application. It provides a comprehensive plan for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application, focusing on a risk-based approach and clear execution guidelines. This strategy will serve as the blueprint for all testing activities, guiding the engineering team (Senior QAs, Test Architects, SDETs) in their efforts.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: The application falls under the E-commerce domain. This domain is characterized by high transaction volumes, sensitive customer data, and direct revenue impact. Checkout and Payment functionalities are considered P0 (Priority 0) due to their direct impact on revenue generation.\n\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**: Failure of the Saucedemo application can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss**: Inability to process orders results in lost revenue.\n    *   **Data Breach**: Compromised customer data (e.g., credit card information) leads to legal and reputational damage.\n    *   **Trust Loss**: Poor user experience due to bugs erodes customer trust and brand loyalty.\n\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Authentication (Login/Logout)\n        *   Product Catalog (Viewing, Sorting)\n        *   Shopping Cart (Adding, Removing Items)\n        *   Checkout & Payments (Order Placement)\n        *   UI/UX (Basic Functionality)\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Performance Testing (Load, Stress, Endurance)\n        *   Security Testing (Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Scanning) - *Note: Basic security checks within functional tests are in scope.*\n        *   Accessibility Testing (WCAG Compliance)\n        *   Localization Testing (Multi-language support)\n        *   Detailed Error Handling (Beyond critical error messages)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy employs a phased approach, starting with a Smoke suite for rapid health checks, followed by a Regression suite for in-depth verification.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Definition**: A minimal set of 'Happy Path' tests that verify the system's most critical functions are working. If these fail, the build is rejected.\n    *   **Goal**: To quickly assess the stability of a new build and ensure core functionalities are operational.\n    *   **Scope**:\n        *   User Login (Valid `standard_user` credentials)\n        *   Product Catalog Load (Verify product listing page loads successfully)\n        *   Add Item to Cart (Add a single, in-stock item to the cart)\n        *   Checkout (Complete purchase with default shipping/payment)\n    *   **Data Strategy**: Static test data for the `standard_user` is sufficient for the Smoke suite.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**:\n    *   **Definition**: A comprehensive suite of tests ensuring that recent changes have not broken existing functionality. Covers variations, edge cases, and error handling.\n    *   **Goal**: To ensure that new features or bug fixes haven't introduced regressions in existing functionality.\n    *   **Scope**:\n        *   **Authentication**:\n            *   Login with Invalid Password\n            *   Logout Functionality\n        *   **Product Catalog**:\n            *   Sort products by Price (Low to High, High to Low)\n            *   View Product Details\n        *   **Shopping Cart**:\n            *   Update Quantity in Cart\n            *   Remove Item from Cart\n        *   **Checkout & Payments**:\n            *   Checkout with formatted Address\n            *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code\n            *   Payment Decline Simulation\n            *   Calculate Tax/Shipping correctly\n    *   **Data Strategy**: A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used. For example, product names and prices can be read from a configuration file or database.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: This design pattern promotes maintainability and reusability by encapsulating page elements and interactions within dedicated page objects.\n        *   Example: `LoginPage`, `ProductsPage`, `CartPage`, `CheckoutPage`\n    *   **Language**: Java or Python (based on team expertise)\n    *   **Test Runner**: JUnit or pytest (depending on language choice)\n    *   **Assertion Library**: AssertJ or Hamcrest (for fluent assertions)\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Implement polling assertions (e.g., using Awaitility) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to handle dynamic content loading. Avoid implicit waits as they can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n    *   **Self-Healing**: Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common issues, such as stale element references. This can involve refreshing the page or re-locating elements.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests, allowing them to be re-executed a limited number of times before failing.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**: The autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n    *   `/inventory.html`: Product listing page (focus on sorting and filtering)\n    *   `/cart.html`: Shopping cart page (focus on quantity updates and removals)\n    *   `/checkout-step-one.html`: Checkout information page (focus on address input)\n    *   `/checkout-step-two.html`: Checkout overview page (focus on price calculations)\n    *   `/checkout-complete.html`: Order confirmation page (focus on success message)\n\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes**: Verify that all requests return a 200 OK status code, indicating successful retrieval of resources.\n    *   **Element Visibility**: Ensure that critical elements (e.g., product names, prices, buttons) are visible and interactable.\n    *   **Text Verification**: Verify that specific text strings (e.g., \"Welcome\", \"Thank you for your order\") are present on the page.\n    *   **Data Validation**: Validate that data displayed on the page (e.g., product prices, cart totals) is accurate and consistent.\n    *   **Functional Verification**: Ensure that core functionalities (e.g., adding items to cart, completing checkout) are working as expected.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for ensuring the quality of the Saucedemo e-commerce application. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can effectively identify and address potential issues, delivering a reliable and user-friendly experience."
