  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for Saucedemo.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo.com is an e-commerce platform, albeit a simplified one for demonstration purposes.  The core business functionality revolves around product display, shopping cart management, and checkout.  Given the nature of e-commerce, the **Checkout process is considered P0 (Priority 0) - Critical**.  Failure in this area directly impacts revenue generation. Authentication and Product Catalog are P1 (High Priority).\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nSystem failures can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user experience due to broken functionality.\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect order information or payment processing errors (less relevant for a demo site, but important to consider in a real-world scenario).\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Authentication (Login)\n*   Product Catalog (Sorting)\n*   Shopping Cart (Adding Items)\n*   Checkout Process\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   User Registration\n*   Password Reset\n*   Detailed Product Information Pages (beyond basic display)\n*   Payment Gateway Integration (simulated in Saucedemo)\n*   Order History\n*   Customer Support Features\n*   Performance Testing\n*   Security Testing (beyond basic authentication)\n*   Accessibility Testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will provide a rapid health check of the core functionality.  If any of these tests fail, the build is considered unstable and should be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Login**\n    *   **Description:** Verify a standard user can successfully log in to the application.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://www.saucedemo.com/`.\n        2.  Enter valid username (`standard_user`).\n        3.  Enter valid password (`secret_sauce`).\n        4.  Click \"Login\".\n        5.  Verify user is redirected to the product catalog page.\n*   **Test Case 2: Sort Products by Price (Low to High)**\n    *   **Description:** Verify products can be sorted by price from low to high.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Log in as `standard_user` (as in Test Case 1).\n        2.  Select \"Price (low to high)\" from the sort dropdown.\n        3.  Verify the first product displayed has the lowest price.\n*   **Test Case 3: Add Lowest Price Item to Cart**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the lowest priced item can be added to the cart.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Log in as `standard_user` and sort by price (as in Test Cases 1 & 2).\n        2.  Click \"Add to cart\" button for the first product (lowest price).\n        3.  Verify the cart icon in the header displays \"1\".\n*   **Test Case 4: Complete Checkout**\n    *   **Description:** Verify a user can complete the checkout process with valid information.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Log in as `standard_user`, sort by price, and add the lowest price item to the cart (as in Test Cases 1, 2 & 3).\n        2.  Click the cart icon.\n        3.  Click \"Checkout\".\n        4.  Enter valid First Name, Last Name, and Postal Code.\n        5.  Click \"Continue\".\n        6.  Click \"Finish\".\n        7.  Verify the \"Thank you for your order!\" message is displayed.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Not Applicable for this Smoke Test Strategy)\n\nSince the request is for a smoke test, a full regression suite definition is out of scope. However, for future expansion, a regression suite would include:\n\n*   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials).\n*   Sorting by other criteria (name, price high to low).\n*   Removing items from the cart.\n*   Checkout with invalid address information.\n*   Testing the \"Back to Products\" button.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:**  For the smoke tests, use the pre-defined `standard_user` and `secret_sauce` credentials.  No dynamic data generation is required for this initial smoke suite.  Address information can also be hardcoded for simplicity.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application (LoginPage, ProductsPage, CartPage, CheckoutPage, CheckoutOverviewPage, CheckoutCompletePage).  This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading or updating.  This reduces flakiness.  Example:  Instead of immediately asserting that the cart icon displays \"1\", wait for the cart icon to *eventually* display \"1\".\n*   **Explicit Waits:**  Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits to wait for specific elements to be present or visible before interacting with them.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for network-related issues.  A simple retry (up to 2-3 times) can significantly reduce false positives.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows in this order:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` (Focus: Successful login)\n2.  **Products Page:** (Focus: Sorting functionality)\n3.  **Cart Page:** (Focus: Adding items and proceeding to checkout)\n4.  **Checkout Pages (Information, Overview, Complete):** (Focus: Completing the checkout process)\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **General Success:**  The test passes if all steps are executed without exceptions and all assertions are met.\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:**  Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n*   **Text Verification:**  Specific text elements should be present on each page to confirm successful loading and functionality.  Examples:\n    *   Login Page: Verify the presence of the \"Username\" and \"Password\" labels.\n    *   Products Page: Verify the presence of the \"Products\" header.\n    *   Checkout Complete Page: Verify the presence of the \"Thank you for your order!\" message.\n*   **Element State:** Verify the state of elements (e.g., button enabled/disabled, input field is editable).\n*   **Cart Icon:** Verify the cart icon updates correctly after adding items.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a reliable smoke test suite for Saucedemo.com. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and testing needs change."
