  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: Postman.com - Smoke Test Suite\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for the Postman.com website, focusing on Smoke testing. This plan will guide the autonomous agents in efficiently executing smoke tests, verifying critical functionalities, and ensuring a stable user experience.\n\n## 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\n*   **Website URL:** [https://www.postman.com](https://www.postman.com)\n*   **Business Domain:** SaaS (Software as a Service) - API Development and Management Platform.\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Postman is a leading platform for API development, testing, and collaboration. The website serves as a central hub for marketing, product information, documentation, downloads, and account management. Ensuring its stability and core functionality is crucial for user acquisition and retention.\n*   **Target Audience:** Developers, testers, API architects, product managers, and other professionals involved in the API lifecycle.\n*   **Key Areas of Focus:**\n    *   Homepage accessibility and content accuracy.\n    *   Navigation and information architecture.\n    *   User onboarding flow (Sign-up).\n    *   Download access.\n    *   Documentation access.\n    *   Pricing clarity.\n\n## 3. Test Scope: Smoke Test Suite\n\nThe smoke test suite will focus on the most critical functionalities of the Postman website to ensure basic stability and operability. It covers core navigation, a primary user flow (sign-up), and key page elements.\n\n### 3.1. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke test suite includes the following test cases:\n\n#### Test Case 1: Website Availability\n\n*   **Description:** Verifies that the Postman website is accessible and returns a successful HTTP status code.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to [https://www.postman.com](https://www.postman.com).\n    2.  Verify that the HTTP status code is 200 (OK).\n*   **Expected Result:** The website should load successfully and return a 200 status code.\n\n#### Test Case 2: Core Navigation - Menu Links\n\n*   **Description:** Verifies that the main menu links are functional and redirect to the correct pages.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to [https://www.postman.com](https://www.postman.com).\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu (usually in the header).\n    3.  Iterate through the following menu items (adjust based on actual menu items):\n        *   \"Features\"\n        *   \"Pricing\"\n        *   \"Resources\"\n        *   \"Enterprise\"\n    4.  Click each menu item.\n    5.  Verify that the page loads successfully and the URL changes accordingly.\n*   **Expected Result:** Each menu item should redirect to the correct corresponding page without errors.\n\n#### Test Case 3: Core Flow - Homepage Hero & Sign-Up\n\n*   **Description:** Verifies the hero headline is accurate and the \"Sign Up for Free\" button is functional.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to [https://www.postman.com](https://www.postman.com).\n    2.  Verify the main headline on the hero section contains the text 'The API platform'.\n    3.  Locate the \"Sign Up for Free\" button (check common locations: hero section, header).\n    4.  Click the \"Sign Up for Free\" button.\n    5.  Verify that the user is redirected to the sign-up page (URL should contain \"/sign-up\" or similar).\n*   **Expected Result:** The headline text should match the expected value. The \"Sign Up for Free\" button should redirect to the registration page.\n\n## 4. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agent on which elements and pages to prioritize during the test execution and any exploratory testing that might be needed.\n\n*   **Homepage (`/`)**:\n    *   **Prioritize:** Hero section (headline, description, call-to-action buttons). Navigation menu. Footer links. Any prominent announcements or banners.\n    *   **Mining Focus:** Extract all text content within the hero section. Identify all links in the navigation menu and footer. Analyze the structure of the page to understand content hierarchy.\n    *   **Dynamic Content:** Pay attention to any dynamically changing elements (e.g., carousels, news tickers) and log their behavior.\n*   **Navigation Pages (e.g., `/pricing`, `/product`, `/enterprise`)**:\n    *   **Prioritize:** Page titles, headings, pricing tables, feature lists, and call-to-action buttons.\n    *   **Mining Focus:** Extract the main heading to confirm page identity. Identify key features and benefits highlighted on the page. Analyze the pricing structure (if applicable). Look for lead generation forms or contact information.\n*   **Sign-Up Page (`/sign-up` or similar)**:\n    *   **Prioritize:** Input fields (email, password, name), error messages, validation rules, and submit button.\n    *   **Mining Focus:** Identify all input fields and their labels. Analyze the form validation rules. Test various input combinations (valid, invalid, empty) to check error handling.\n*   **General Instructions:**\n    *   **Link Identification:** Identify and record all internal and external links on each page.\n    *   **Element Identification:** Identify key elements (buttons, forms, images, videos) using common CSS selectors (e.g., `button`, `form`, `img`, `video`).\n    *   **Error Handling:** Capture any error messages or unexpected behavior encountered during navigation or interaction.  If elements are not found, report them.\n    *   **Mobile Responsiveness:** If viewport/device switching is supported, prioritize mobile viewports.\n\n## 5. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:** Platform agnostic (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n## 6. Reporting\n\n*   The autonomous agent will generate a detailed report including:\n    *   Test case execution status (Pass/Fail).\n    *   Screenshots of any failures.\n    *   Error messages encountered.\n    *   Performance metrics (page load times).\n    *   List of identified links and their destinations.\n    *   Any anomalies or unexpected behavior observed.\n\n## 7. Success Criteria\n\n*   All smoke test cases must pass.\n*   No critical errors or functional defects are identified.\n*   The website is accessible and responsive.\n\n## 8. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the test suite to include more comprehensive functional testing.\n*   Implement performance testing to monitor website speed and scalability.\n*   Integrate accessibility testing to ensure compliance with WCAG guidelines.\n*   Incorporate cross-browser and cross-device testing."
