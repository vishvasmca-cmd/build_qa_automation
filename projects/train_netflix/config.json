  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: Netflix.com - Smoke Test Suite\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared by:** AI QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis Master Test Plan outlines the smoke test strategy for Netflix.com. It defines the scope, objectives, and approach for ensuring the core functionality of the website is operational. This plan will guide autonomous agents in mining, verifying, and structuring the smoke test suite before any test automation begins.\n\n## 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\n**2.1. Target URL:** https://www.netflix.com\n\n**2.2. Business Domain:** Entertainment (Streaming Service)\n\n**2.3. Domain Analysis:**\n\n*   **Core Business:** Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service offering a wide variety of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and original content.\n*   **Key Functionality:**\n    *   User registration and subscription management.\n    *   Content browsing and search.\n    *   Video playback.\n    *   Personalized recommendations.\n    *   Multi-device compatibility.\n*   **Target Audience:** Broad demographic, segmented by viewing preferences and geographic location.\n*   **Potential Risks:** Service outages, content availability issues, payment processing errors, security vulnerabilities, and poor user experience can significantly impact customer satisfaction and retention.\n\n## 3. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke suite focuses on verifying the essential functionality of Netflix.com. This suite will be executed after each deployment or significant code change to ensure the application is stable.\n\n**3.1. Objectives:**\n\n*   Verify that the website is accessible and responsive.\n*   Ensure core navigation elements are functional.\n*   Validate the critical user flow: accessing the homepage, verifying the headline, and initiating the sign-in/join process.\n\n**3.2. Test Cases:**\n\n| Test Case ID | Description                                                                               | Priority | Test Data  | Expected Result                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SMOKE-001    | Verify website availability.                                                              | High     | None       | Website loads successfully within acceptable time (e.g., < 3 seconds). HTTP status code is 200.                                                                                                  |\n| SMOKE-002    | Verify core navigation menu links are functional.                                          | High     | None       | All main menu links (e.g., \"Home,\" \"TV Shows,\" \"Movies,\" \"My List\") navigate to the correct corresponding pages without errors.                                                 |\n| SMOKE-003    | Verify the hero headline on the homepage.                                                  | High     | None       | The headline on the homepage contains the text \"Unlimited movies, TV shows, and more.\" (Exact match required for this smoke test).                                                    |\n| SMOKE-004    | Find and click the \"Sign In / Join Now\" button.                                         | High     | None       | The \"Sign In / Join Now\" button is present and clickable. Clicking the button redirects the user to the sign-in/registration page. The URL changes to the login or registration page.|\n\n**3.3. Test Environment:**\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version) - as a primary smoke test browser.\n*   **Operating System:** Windows 10/11\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection.\n\n## 4. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions will guide the autonomous agent in identifying and prioritizing elements for testing within the smoke suite.\n\n**4.1. Homepage Mining:**\n\n*   **Prioritize:**\n    *   **Hero Section Headline:** Locate the primary headline element within the main hero section of the page. Use semantic HTML tags like `<h1>` or `<h2>` to identify it or look for elements with clear heading styles.\n    *   **Navigation Menu:** Identify the main navigation menu. Look for `<nav>` elements or lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`) containing menu items.\n    *   **\"Sign In / Join Now\" Button:** Search for button elements (`<button>`) or link elements (`<a>`) that contain the text \"Sign In,\" \"Join Now,\" or a combination of both.  Prioritize buttons in the top-right corner or prominently displayed on the page.\n*   **Extraction Strategy:**\n    *   Use CSS selectors targeting semantic HTML elements (e.g., `h1`, `nav`, `button`).\n    *   Use XPath to locate elements based on text content (e.g., `//button[contains(text(), 'Sign In')]`).\n\n**4.2. Navigation Mining:**\n\n*   **Prioritize:**\n    *   Extract all link elements (`<a>`) within the main navigation menu.\n    *   Focus on the links that represent the main categories of content (e.g., \"Home,\" \"TV Shows,\" \"Movies\").\n*   **Extraction Strategy:**\n    *   Use CSS selectors to target links within the navigation menu (e.g., `nav a`).\n    *   Extract the `href` attribute of each link.\n\n**4.3. Verification Mining:**\n\n*   **Prioritize:**\n    *   Verify the text content of the hero headline element.\n    *   Verify that the `href` attributes of the navigation links point to valid URLs within the Netflix domain.\n    *   Verify that clicking the \"Sign In / Join Now\" button redirects to a login or registration page.\n*   **Verification Strategy:**\n    *   Use text comparison to verify the headline text.\n    *   Use HTTP status code checks to verify the validity of navigation links (check for 200 OK).\n    *   Use URL comparison to verify redirection after clicking the \"Sign In / Join Now\" button.\n\n## 5. Reporting\n\n*   The autonomous agent should generate a clear and concise report summarizing the results of the smoke tests.\n*   The report should include:\n    *   Test case ID and description.\n    *   Status (Pass/Fail).\n    *   Error messages (if any).\n    *   Screenshots (especially for failed test cases).\n    *   Execution time for each test case.\n*   Failed test cases should be flagged prominently, and the report should provide enough information to facilitate debugging.\n\n## 6. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the smoke suite to include more critical user flows, such as content search and video playback.\n*   Implement smoke tests for different device types (e.g., mobile, tablet).\n*   Integrate the smoke suite into the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure that it is executed automatically after each deployment."
