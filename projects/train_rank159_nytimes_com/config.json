  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: NYTimes.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a smoke test suite targeting NYTimes.com. This strategy will guide the engineering team in developing and executing automated tests to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** NYTimes.com is a high-traffic news and media website. Its business criticality is high due to its reliance on user engagement, subscriptions, and advertising revenue.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionality (e.g., website availability, login) can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Reduced subscription revenue, advertising impressions.\n    *   **Trust Loss:** Damage to brand reputation, loss of user trust.\n    *   **Operational Disruption:** Inability to deliver news and information.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Existence and visibility of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar), 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   User authentication or registration processes.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing (initially).\n        *   Error handling or negative scenarios.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the NYTimes.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Visibility:** Verify the presence and visibility of:\n            *   Login button/link.\n            *   Signup/GetStarted button/link (or similar).\n            *   Try for Free button/link (or similar).\n            *   5 additional buttons (any buttons on the homepage).\n            *   2 links (any links on the homepage).\n            *   2 menu bars (navigation menus).\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the NYTimes.com homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java` (or equivalent in the chosen language)\n            *   Contains locators for Login button, Signup button, Try for Free button, links, and menu bars.\n            *   Contains methods to verify the presence and visibility of these elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues with element loading. This will reduce flakiness.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and visible before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed assertions, especially for element visibility checks.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **NYTimes.com Homepage:** The primary focus for element discovery.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 (OK)\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"The New York Times\" (or similar).\n    *   **Element Visibility:**\n        *   Elements are present in the DOM.\n        *   Elements are visible on the page (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()` returns `true`).\n        *   Elements are not obscured by other elements.\n*   **Success Definition:** All verification criteria are met for all test cases in the smoke suite. If any test case fails, the build should be considered unstable and further investigation is required."
