  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Smoke Testing for pv-cdn.net\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the pv-cdn.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The target URL appears to be a general web application, potentially a content delivery network (CDN) provider or related service. The business criticality is moderate, as website availability and basic functionality are essential for user engagement and potential business transactions.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or core elements to function (login, signup) could lead to:\n    *   **Loss of potential customers:** Users unable to access the site may seek alternative solutions.\n    *   **Damage to brand reputation:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the company.\n    *   **Reduced user engagement:** Existing users may become frustrated and disengaged.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website accessibility (HTTP 200 OK).\n        *   Loading of key page elements (menus, buttons, links).\n        *   Existence of Login/Signup/GetStarted/Try for Free (or similar) buttons.\n        *   Existence of at least two links.\n        *   Existence of at least two menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons and links (clicking and navigating).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Accessibility:** Verify the website returns an HTTP 200 OK status code.\n        2.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads without errors.\n        3.  **Button Existence:** Verify the presence of at least five buttons (e.g., Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, etc.).\n        4.  **Link Existence:** Verify the presence of at least two links.\n        5.  **Menu Bar Existence:** Verify the presence of at least two menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on the presence of elements, not their functionality or data handling.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke testing. Consider using a simple HTTP client library (e.g., `requests` in Python, `axios` in JavaScript) for website accessibility and a DOM parsing library (e.g., `Beautiful Soup` in Python, `jsdom` in JavaScript) to verify the presence of elements.\n    *   Page Object Model (POM) is not strictly necessary for this simple smoke test, but can be introduced for future regression testing.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with a short timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) to allow for minor variations in page load times.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and log informative messages.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`/`):** The primary target for all smoke tests.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Accessibility:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    2.  **Homepage Load:** No HTTP errors or exceptions during page load.\n    3.  **Button Existence:** At least five buttons with relevant text (Login, Signup, Get Started, Try for Free, etc.) are present on the page.\n    4.  **Link Existence:** At least two links (<a> tags with `href` attributes) are present on the page.\n    5.  **Menu Bar Existence:** At least two distinct menu bars (identified by common HTML structures like `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`) are present on the page."
