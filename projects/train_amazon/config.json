  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: Amazon.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the master test plan for a smoke test suite for Amazon.com, a global e-commerce platform. The primary goal of this test suite is to ensure the basic functionality and core user flows of the website are operational. This plan will guide the automated testing agents in efficiently executing the smoke tests.\n\n## 2. Domain Information\n\n*   **Website URL:** [https://www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com)\n*   **Business Domain:** E-commerce\n*   **Description:** Amazon.com is a leading e-commerce platform offering a vast selection of products and services to consumers worldwide. It includes retail sales, third-party marketplace, cloud computing services (AWS), digital streaming, and more. For this smoke test, we will focus on the core e-commerce aspects of the site.\n*   **User Persona:**  New user/Guest User - someone who hasn't previously signed in.\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nThis smoke test suite will cover the following critical areas:\n\n*   Website availability and basic functionality.\n*   Core navigation elements and their responsiveness.\n*   A primary user flow - accessing the homepage and triggering the sign-in flow.\n\n## 4. Test Objectives\n\n*   Verify the website is accessible and loads successfully.\n*   Confirm that core navigation links are functional.\n*   Validate the presence and functionality of the specified hero headline.\n*   Ensure the \"Sign In / Shop Now\" button is present and functional.\n\n## 5. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the following test cases:\n\n### 5.1. Website Availability Test\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the Amazon.com homepage loads successfully and returns a 200 OK HTTP status code.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to [https://www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com).\n    2.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200.\n*   **Expected Result:** The website should load without errors, and the HTTP status code should be 200.\n\n### 5.2. Core Navigation Test\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the core navigation links in the header and footer are present and navigable. Focus on key sections like \"Today's Deals\", \"Customer Service\", and \"Registry.\"\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to [https://www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com).\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu in the header.\n    3.  Locate the key sections in the footer.\n    4.  Click each link (\"Today's Deals\", \"Customer Service\", \"Registry.\").\n    5.  Verify that each link navigates to the correct page and loads successfully (200 status code).\n*   **Expected Result:** Each navigation link should redirect to the appropriate page without errors.\n\n### 5.3. Core Flow Test: Homepage Headline and Sign-In Button\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Description:** Verify the presence of the hero headline and the \"Sign In / Shop Now\" button on the homepage.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to [https://www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com).\n    2.  Locate the hero headline section of the page.\n    3.  Verify that the hero headline contains the text \"Everything you need, delivered\".\n    4.  Locate the \"Sign In / Shop Now\" button on the homepage.  This is a critical starting point for many users.\n    5.  Click the \"Sign In / Shop Now\" button.\n    6.  Verify that clicking the button redirects to the sign-in/account creation page.\n*   **Expected Result:** The hero headline should be present and contain the expected text. The \"Sign In / Shop Now\" button should be present and redirect the user to the correct sign-in/account creation page.\n\n## 6. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nTo efficiently execute the smoke tests, the automated agents should prioritize the following elements and pages:\n\n*   **Homepage ([https://www.amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com))**: This is the entry point for the majority of users.  Focus on:\n    *   Hero Headline:  Mine the element containing the main promotional message.  Verify text content.\n    *   \"Sign In / Shop Now\" button: Mine the button element and verify its `href` attribute points to the correct sign-in page.\n    *   Header Navigation: Mine all top-level navigation links.\n    *   Footer Navigation: Mine the \"Help\", \"Account\", \"Returns\", \"Contact Us\" links in the footer.\n*   **Target Elements**: Agents should use robust selectors (e.g., XPath, CSS selectors) that are less likely to break due to minor UI changes.  Prioritize selectors based on `id` attributes where available, followed by unique `class` combinations.  Avoid selectors based solely on text content, as this is prone to localization issues.\n*   **Error Handling**:  Implement error handling to gracefully handle unexpected issues during test execution.  Log detailed error messages, including screenshots or page source snippets, to aid in debugging.\n*   **Dynamic Content**: Be aware of dynamic content (e.g., personalized recommendations, A/B testing variations).  The tests should be resilient to minor variations in content as long as the core functionality remains intact.\n\n## 7. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS (latest version)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n## 8. Test Data\n\nNo specific test data is required for the smoke tests as we are not creating accounts or making purchases at this stage.\n\n## 9. Entry Criteria\n\n*   The Amazon.com website must be deployed to the test environment.\n*   The test environment must be configured correctly.\n\n## 10. Exit Criteria\n\n*   All smoke test cases have been executed.\n*   All critical defects identified during smoke testing have been resolved.\n*   A smoke test report has been generated.\n\n## 11. Reporting\n\nA smoke test report will be generated after each test execution, summarizing the test results, including:\n\n*   Number of test cases executed.\n*   Number of test cases passed.\n*   Number of test cases failed.\n*   List of defects identified.\n\n## 12. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to cover additional critical user flows, such as product search, adding items to the cart, and initiating the checkout process.\n*   Integrate the smoke tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that every code deployment is thoroughly tested.\n*   Add more detailed validation of UI elements to ensure visual consistency across different browsers and devices.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for the Amazon.com smoke test suite. By following these guidelines, the automated testing agents can efficiently verify the basic functionality and core user flows of the website, ensuring a high-quality user experience."
