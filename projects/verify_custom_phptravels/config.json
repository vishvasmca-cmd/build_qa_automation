  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: PHPTRAVELS - Hotel Search Functionality\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### Domain Analysis:\nPHPTRAVELS is a demo travel booking website. The \"Hotel Search\" functionality is a critical feature for revenue generation. Failure in this functionality directly impacts the user's ability to book hotels, leading to lost business and reputational damage. This feature is classified as P0 (Priority 0).\n\n### Risk Profile:\nSystem failures in the Hotel Search functionality can lead to:\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process bookings, resulting in lost revenue.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user experience, leading to loss of trust and customers.\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect or corrupted hotel data displayed to users.\n\n### Testing Scope:\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Hotel Search Functionality (Search box, Date pickers, Guests selection, Search button)\n*   Search Results Page (Hotel listings, Sorting, Filtering)\n*   Hotel Details Page (Availability, Pricing, Booking process - as far as the demo allows)\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions)\n*   Mobile responsiveness (using browser developer tools)\n*   Basic security checks on input fields related to search (destination, dates)\n*   Performance testing: Response time of search results page\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Actual booking process (beyond demo limitations)\n*   Integration with payment gateways (demo limitations)\n*   Third-party API integrations beyond the core search functionality\n*   Complex performance testing (load, stress, endurance)\n*   Accessibility testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity):\n\nThe smoke suite will focus on ensuring the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Case 1:** Navigate to the home page and verify the Hotels link/tab is present.\n*   **Test Case 2:** Enter a valid destination in the search box.\n*   **Test Case 3:** Select check-in and check-out dates.\n*   **Test Case 4:** Click the \"Search\" button and verify that the search results page loads without errors (HTTP 200).\n*   **Verification Criteria (Smoke):** Page loads without errors, key elements are present and responsive.\n\n### Regression Suite (Deep Dive):\n\nThe regression suite will comprehensively test the Hotel Search functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid destination input (e.g., special characters, SQL injection attempts).\n    *   Invalid date ranges (e.g., check-out date before check-in date, dates in the past).\n    *   Leaving destination field empty.\n    *   Entering large number of guests (boundary testing).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Searching for hotels far into the future.\n    *   Searching for hotels with a very long stay duration.\n    *   Handling of no search results (ensure informative message is displayed).\n    *   Verify data displayed in results: Name, price, image\n    *   Filtering and Sorting\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input field validation to prevent basic SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n*   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n    *   (N/A, based on URL)\n*   **Validation Messages:**\n    *   Ensure appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs (e.g., \"Please enter a destination,\" \"Invalid date range\").\n\n### Data Strategy:\n\n*   **Static Data:** A set of predefined valid and invalid destinations will be used. This data will be stored in a centralized configuration file (e.g., JSON, CSV).\n*   **Dynamic Generation:** The current date will be used as the base for generating valid check-in and check-out dates. This ensures the tests are always relevant.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### Framework Recommendation:\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This pattern promotes code reusability and maintainability by encapsulating page elements and interactions into separate classes (e.g., `HomePage`, `HotelSearchPage`, `SearchResultsPage`, `HotelDetailsPage`).\n\n### Resilience Strategy:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions to handle asynchronous loading of elements (e.g., search results). This prevents false failures due to timing issues. Example: Wait up to 10 seconds for search results to appear.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific elements to become visible or interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms, such as retrying element locators if they fail on the first attempt.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to intermittent network issues or server unavailability.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### Mining Targets (Prioritized):\n\nThe autonomous agent should focus on exploring these pages and flows first:\n\n1.  **Home Page:**  Focus on the Hotel search widget (destination input, date pickers, guests selection).\n2.  **Search Results Page:** Explore different sorting and filtering options, verify hotel listings.\n3.  **Hotel Details Page:** (If demo allows) Verify availability, pricing, and booking process elements.\n\n### Verification Criteria:\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return HTTP 200 (OK).\n*   **Element Presence:** Ensure that key elements on each page are present and visible (e.g., search results, hotel images, prices).\n*   **Data Accuracy:** Verify that the data displayed is consistent and accurate (e.g., destination name, dates, prices).\n*   **Error Message Handling:** Ensure that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or when no results are found.\n*   **Functional Flows:** Hotel search -> Results display -> Hotel details"
