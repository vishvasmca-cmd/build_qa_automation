  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Nginx.org Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the smoke testing of the Nginx.org website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Nginx.org is a critical resource for information and downloads related to the Nginx web server. While not directly transactional, its availability and accuracy are vital for developers and system administrators.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Inability to access information reflects poorly on the Nginx project.\n    *   **Lost Productivity:** Developers unable to access documentation or downloads experience delays.\n    *   **Security Risks:** If the website is compromised, it could distribute malicious software.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page rendering.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functional testing of specific features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing beyond basic availability.\n        *   Testing of external links.\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links or menu bars.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Nginx.org homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of at least five buttons (e.g., Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, Download, Documentation).\n        3.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of at least two links (e.g., \"About\", \"Contact\").\n        4.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of at least two menu bars (e.g., \"Products\", \"Resources\").\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for Smoke Test)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on the presence and accessibility of elements, not data input or manipulation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Nginx.org homepage and its key elements. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential loading delays. For example, poll for the presence of a button for a short period before failing the test.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for website launch failures. This can help mitigate transient network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: Focus on the main landing page of Nginx.org.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Launch:**\n        *   **Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND the `<title>` tag contains \"nginx\".\n    2.  **Element Presence (Buttons, Links, Menu Bars):**\n        *   **Success:** The specified number of buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page AND are visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS)."
