  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Nginx.org Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Nginx.org is the website for the Nginx web server and related technologies. While not directly transactional (e.g., e-commerce), its availability and correct functioning are crucial for:\n    *   **Brand Reputation**: A down or malfunctioning website reflects poorly on the Nginx product and company.\n    *   **Information Access**: Users rely on the site for documentation, downloads, and community resources.\n    *   **Lead Generation**: The site likely serves as a key touchpoint for potential customers.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failure of the Nginx.org website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage**: Negative perception of Nginx's reliability.\n    *   **Reduced User Adoption**: Difficulty accessing documentation and downloads.\n    *   **Lost Business Opportunities**: Inability for potential customers to learn about and adopt Nginx products.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website availability and basic functionality.\n        *   Loading of key pages (Homepage).\n        *   Presence and visibility of critical UI elements (buttons, links, menus).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed functional testing of specific features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially, focus on desktop).\n        *   Clicking on any links or buttons.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Goal**: Verify the website is up, the core layout is rendering, and key navigation elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Homepage Load**: Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Button Presence**: Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons (any of \"Login\", \"Signup\", \"Get Started\", \"Try for Free\", or similar).\n        3.  **Link Presence**: Verify the presence of at least 2 links.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Presence**: Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Static Data**: No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent the Nginx.org homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   `HomePage`: Page object representing the Nginx.org homepage.\n            *   Methods: `isPageLoaded()`, `getButtonCount()`, `getLinkCount()`, `getMenuBarCount()`.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to check for the presence of elements. This helps mitigate timing issues and potential flakiness.\n    *   **Example**: Instead of immediately failing if a button is not found, poll for its presence for up to 5 seconds.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    1.  **Homepage Load**:\n        *   **Success**: HTTP 200 OK status code.\n        *   **Success**: Page title contains \"nginx\".\n    2.  **Button Presence**:\n        *   **Success**: `HomePage.getButtonCount()` returns a value >= 5.\n    3.  **Link Presence**:\n        *   **Success**: `HomePage.getLinkCount()` returns a value >= 2.\n    4.  **Menu Bar Presence**:\n        *   **Success**: `HomePage.getMenuBarCount()` returns a value >= 2."
