  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: NIST.gov - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the NIST.gov website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://nist.gov\n**Business Domain:** General Web\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** NIST.gov is a critical resource for scientific and technical information. While not an e-commerce site, its availability and accuracy are vital for researchers, businesses, and government agencies.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure of NIST.gov can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust in NIST as a reliable source of information.\n    *   **Operational Disruption:** Hindrance to research, development, and standardization efforts.\n    *   **Public Access Issues:** Inability for the public to access important information.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic functionality.\n        *   Loading of key pages (Homepage).\n        *   Existence of critical elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual pages or features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic availability).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (limited to primary browsers).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is up and running and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the NIST.gov homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Button Existence:** Verify the existence of at least five (5) buttons with labels like \"Login,\" \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or \"Try for Free\" (or similar calls to action).\n        3.  **Link Existence:** Verify the existence of at least two (2) links on the homepage.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Existence:** Verify the existence of at least two (2) menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for Smoke Testing)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for smoke testing. The focus is on the presence of elements, not their functionality with specific data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Recommended for maintainability and readability. Create a `HomePage` object containing locators for buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential delays in element loading. For example, poll for the presence of a button for a short period before failing the test.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for initial page load failures, as temporary network issues can occur.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage:** https://nist.gov\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage Load:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Button Existence:** Element is present in the DOM and visible.\n    *   **Link Existence:** Element is present in the DOM and visible.\n    *   **Menu Bar Existence:** Element is present in the DOM and visible.\n*   **Success Definition:** All smoke tests pass, indicating the website is operational and key elements are present."
