  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: NIST.gov Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** NIST.gov is a website for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Its primary purpose is to provide information, resources, and standards related to science, technology, and measurement. While not a direct revenue-generating site, its availability and accuracy are crucial for maintaining trust and facilitating scientific and technological advancement.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of NIST.gov can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Undermining NIST's credibility as a reliable source of information.\n    *   **Hindered Research:** Impeding access to critical standards and data for researchers and industries.\n    *   **Potential Security Vulnerabilities:** If the site is compromised, it could be used to spread misinformation or malicious content.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic functionality.\n        *   Loading of key pages (Homepage).\n        *   Presence and accessibility of critical elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, key links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed content validation.\n        *   Functionality of external links.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic availability).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially focus on desktop).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is up and running, and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the NIST.gov homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   Login button (if present).\n            *   Signup/GetStarted button (or equivalent).\n            *   Try for Free button (or equivalent).\n            *   5 distinct buttons (any).\n            *   2 distinct links (any).\n            *   2 menu bars (any).\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this \"smoke\" test strategy, but included for completeness)\n    *   **Objective:** N/A\n    *   **Test Cases:** N/A\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence and page load.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for this smoke test. Consider using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   **Page Objects:** Create a `HomePage` object to represent the NIST.gov homepage. This object should contain methods to:\n        *   Navigate to the homepage.\n        *   Verify the presence of the specified buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to check for element presence. This helps to handle cases where elements may take a short time to load.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and log informative messages.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://nist.gov):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage Load:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200 (OK).\n        *   Page title contains \"NIST\" (or a relevant keyword).\n    *   **Element Presence:**\n        *   The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page.\n        *   Elements are visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clearly report any failures, including the specific element that was not found or the HTTP status code.\n    *   Provide screenshots or other evidence to support the findings."
