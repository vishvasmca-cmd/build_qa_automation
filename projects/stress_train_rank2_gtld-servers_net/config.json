  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: gtld-servers.net\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for gtld-servers.net, focusing on regression testing to ensure the stability and reliability of the website. This strategy will guide the entire engineering team, including Senior QAs, Test Architects, and SDETs, in building a robust and maintainable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** The website appears to be related to domain name services (DNS) or internet infrastructure. While not directly e-commerce, its availability and correct functioning are critical for internet stability and trust.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure of this website could lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Trust:** Inability to access information about DNS services.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** If the website is unavailable or malfunctioning, it reflects poorly on the organization.\n    *   **Indirect Financial Impact:** While not directly generating revenue, downtime could impact related services or partnerships.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and accessibility.\n        *   Correct rendering of the user interface (UI) across different browsers and devices.\n        *   Functionality of key elements like navigation menus, links, and buttons.\n        *   Basic security checks (input validation).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   In-depth DNS server testing.\n        *   Performance testing beyond basic load times.\n        *   Detailed compatibility testing with obscure browsers.\n        *   Back-end infrastructure testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Verify basic website availability and core functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  Website is accessible (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  Home page loads within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        3.  Key elements (header, footer, main content area) are present.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Ensure that changes haven't broken existing functionality and that the website behaves as expected under various conditions.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Navigation:**\n            *   Verify all menu items are present and link to the correct pages (without clicking).\n            *   Verify all links on the homepage are present and link to the correct pages (without clicking).\n        2.  **Buttons:**\n            *   Verify the presence of the specified buttons (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, and two others).\n            *   Verify the buttons are enabled and clickable (functionality will be tested in separate, more focused tests).\n        3.  **Negative Testing:**\n            *   Attempt to access non-existent pages (e.g., `https://gtld-servers.net/invalid-page`) and verify a 404 error is displayed.\n            *   Submit forms with invalid data (if any forms are present).\n        4.  **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Test the website with different browser window sizes (responsive design).\n            *   Simulate slow network connections to check loading behavior.\n        5.  **Security:**\n            *   Basic input validation checks on any forms present (e.g., check for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting `<script>` tags).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** For basic UI element verification, static data is sufficient.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** If forms are present, consider using dynamic data generation (e.g., using Faker libraries) to create unique test data for each run.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the website as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the home page.\n        *   `LoginPage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the login page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable, especially when dealing with dynamic content.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms, such as retrying element interactions if they fail due to transient issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits and use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** `https://gtld-servers.net` - Focus on identifying and verifying the presence of key elements (menus, links, buttons).\n    2.  **Any Login/Signup Pages:** If present, these are critical for user access and should be thoroughly tested.\n    3.  **Any Contact/About Us Pages:** These pages often contain important information and should be verified for accuracy.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that all pages return an HTTP 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Verify that all expected elements (menus, links, buttons) are present on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that key text elements (e.g., button labels, menu item text) match the expected values.\n    *   **Link Verification:** Verify that links point to the correct URLs (without clicking).\n*   **Prioritization:**\n    *   Prioritize testing the homepage and any login/signup pages.\n    *   Focus on verifying the presence and functionality of key elements.\n    *   Implement negative testing to ensure the website handles invalid input gracefully.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing gtld-servers.net. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the website's stability, reliability, and user experience."
