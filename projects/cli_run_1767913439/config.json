  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for ParaBank, a demo web application used for demonstrating software testing principles. This strategy will guide the entire engineering team (Senior QAs, Test Architects, SDETs) in building and executing a robust and reliable testing framework *before* any automation starts.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nParaBank is a banking application simulation. While not a real-world financial institution, the application encompasses core banking functionalities. These functionalities are business-critical within the context of the application. The following features are ranked by priority:\n\n*   **P0 (Critical):** Login, Open Account, Transfer Funds\n*   **P1 (High):** Registration, Request Loan\n*   **P2 (Medium):** Account Details, Transaction History, Bill Pay (not explicitly requested, but related to fund transfers)\n*   **P3 (Low):** Contact Us, Site Map (informational)\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure in the application can lead to:\n\n*   **Data Corruption:** Inaccurate account balances or transaction history.\n*   **Functional Errors:** Inability to log in, transfer funds, or open accounts.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Potential for unauthorized access to accounts.\n*   **Trust Loss:** Users will not trust the application's integrity, impacting its credibility.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All core banking functionalities (Login, Open Account, Transfer Funds, Request Loan, Registration).\n*   Positive and negative test scenarios for all in-scope functionalities.\n*   Edge cases and boundary value testing for financial transactions.\n*   Security testing focusing on input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, and endurance testing).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n*   Detailed accessibility testing beyond basic validation.\n*   Third-party integrations beyond the core banking functionalities (if any).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be a minimal set of tests to ensure the system is operational after each build or deployment.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify Login functionality with valid credentials.\n    *   Verify the main \"Accounts Overview\" page loads after successful login.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build/deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** If any test fails, the build is considered unstable and rejected.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will be a comprehensive set of tests covering all in-scope functionalities.\n\n*   **Functional Testing:**\n    *   **Login:**\n        *   Valid login credentials.\n        *   Invalid login credentials (invalid username, invalid password, locked account).\n    *   **Registration:**\n        *   Successful registration with valid data.\n        *   Registration with missing required fields.\n        *   Registration with invalid data (e.g., invalid phone number, invalid SSN format).\n        *   Duplicate registration attempts.\n    *   **Open Account:**\n        *   Successful account opening with valid data.\n        *   Opening an account without selecting an account type.\n        *   Attempting to open too many accounts of a certain type.\n    *   **Transfer Funds:**\n        *   Successful fund transfer between accounts.\n        *   Attempting to transfer more funds than available in the source account.\n        *   Transferring funds to a non-existent account.\n        *   Transferring zero or negative amounts.\n    *   **Request Loan:**\n        *   Successful loan request with valid data.\n        *   Loan request with missing required fields.\n        *   Loan request with an amount exceeding the allowed limit.\n        *   Loan request with invalid data (e.g., invalid down payment).\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid input values in all forms (e.g., special characters, HTML tags).\n    *   Attempting to perform actions without being logged in.\n    *   Submitting forms with missing required fields.\n    *   Exploiting boundary values (e.g., minimum and maximum account balances).\n    *   Testing timeout scenarios (e.g., session expiration).\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency testing (multiple users performing the same action simultaneously).\n    *   Handling network failures during transactions.\n    *   Testing with very large or very small account balances.\n    *   Testing with special characters in account names and addresses.\n\n*   **Security Testing:**\n    *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n    *   **Authentication:** Ensure strong password policies and secure storage of credentials.\n    *   **Authorization:** Verify that users can only access their own account information.\n    *   **Session Management:** Implement secure session management to prevent session hijacking.\n    *   **OWASP Top 10 Basics:** All tests must consider OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** Use a combination of static and dynamically generated test data.\n        *   **Static Data:** Use a set of predefined user accounts and account details for basic testing.\n        *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Generate random account numbers, transaction amounts, and user details to increase test coverage and reduce test data dependencies.\n        *   **Data Management:** Store test data in a centralized location (e.g., CSV files, database) for easy access and maintenance.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nImplement a **Page Object Model (POM)** to represent each page as a class.\n\n*   **Benefits:**\n    *   Improved code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   Reduced code duplication.\n    *   Increased test readability.\n    *   Simplified test updates when the UI changes.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   Each page should have its own class.\n    *   Page classes should contain:\n        *   Locators for all elements on the page (e.g., buttons, text fields, labels).\n        *   Methods for performing actions on the page (e.g., login, transfer funds).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\nImplement strategies to handle test flakiness:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met before proceeding. This helps to avoid false failures due to timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific elements to be interactable before performing actions on them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors, such as retrying failed actions or refreshing the page.\n*   **Test Retries:** Configure the test framework to automatically retry failed tests a certain number of times.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages and flows first:\n\n*   **Home Page:** Verify basic elements and links.\n*   **Registration Page:** Attempt to create new accounts with different data combinations (valid, invalid, missing).\n*   **Login Page:** Verify successful and unsuccessful login attempts.\n*   **Accounts Overview Page:** Verify account balances and transaction history.\n*   **Transfer Funds Page:** Attempt to transfer funds between accounts with different amounts and scenarios.\n*   **Request Loan Page:** Submit loan requests with different loan amounts and down payments.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n\"Success\" is defined as:\n\n*   **HTTP Status Code 200:** Indicates that the page loaded successfully.\n*   **Expected Text Visible:** Verify that key elements on the page display the expected text (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, account balance on the Accounts Overview page).\n*   **Successful Transactions:** Verify that transactions (e.g., fund transfers, loan requests) are processed correctly and reflected in the account balances and transaction history.\n*   **No Error Messages:** Verify that no unexpected error messages are displayed during the test execution.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will ensure a comprehensive and reliable testing approach for ParaBank. By focusing on risk assessment, strategic testing, and robust architecture, we will deliver a high-quality application that meets the needs of its users."
