  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Contact Us Form\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the functional testing of the \"Contact Us\" form on AutomationExercise.com. It serves as a guiding document for all testing activities, ensuring a consistent, risk-based, and efficient approach.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** This is a general web application, likely an e-commerce demo site. The Contact Us form is crucial for user support and feedback, impacting user satisfaction and potentially brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the Contact Us form can lead to:\n    *   **Lost User Inquiries:** Potential missed opportunities for sales or resolving customer issues.\n    *   **Negative User Experience:** Frustration and potential loss of users.\n    *   **Brand Damage:** Perception of poor customer service.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the \"Contact Us\" form (submission, data validation, success message).\n        *   Integration with backend systems (email sending, data storage - if applicable).\n        *   Responsiveness of the form across different browsers and devices.\n        *   Accessibility of the form (adherence to accessibility guidelines).\n        *   Security aspects (protection against spam/malicious inputs).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress, etc.).\n        *   Detailed security penetration testing beyond basic input validation.\n        *   Testing of other functionalities on the website outside the Contact Us form flow.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify basic availability and functionality of the \"Contact Us\" page.\n    *   **Test Case:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://automationexercise.com/contact_us`.\n        2.  Verify that the \"Contact Us\" form and its fields are displayed.\n        3.  Submit the form with valid data.\n        4.  Verify the \"Success\" message is displayed.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Goal:** Ensure that changes elsewhere on the site have not broken the Contact Us form functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Valid Data Submission:** Submit the form with valid data in all fields and verify the successful submission message.\n        2.  **Invalid Email Format:** Submit the form with an invalid email address format and verify the appropriate error message.\n        3.  **Missing Required Fields:** Submit the form with missing required fields (Name, Email, Subject, Message) and verify the appropriate error messages.\n        4.  **Maximum Length Validation:** Submit the form with data exceeding the maximum allowed length for each field (if applicable) and verify the appropriate error messages.\n        5.  **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Execute key test cases on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent behavior.\n        6.  **Responsiveness:** Test the form on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure proper layout and functionality.\n        7.  **HTML Injection:** Attempt to inject HTML code into the form fields to verify proper sanitization and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.\n        8.  **Spam Prevention:** Test CAPTCHA (if present) to ensure it effectively prevents automated submissions.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:**\n        *   **Static Data:** Store valid and invalid data sets in a separate configuration file (e.g., JSON, CSV).\n        *   **Dynamic Data:**  For unique email addresses or other dynamically generated fields, use libraries to create random data during test execution. Example: `test+${Date.now()}@example.com`\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** **Page Object Model (POM)**\n    *   **Rationale:** POM promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability. It encapsulates page elements and interactions within dedicated page classes.\n    *   **Structure:**\n        *   `BasePage`: Contains common methods for navigation, element interaction, and assertions.\n        *   `ContactUsPage`: Extends `BasePage` and contains elements and methods specific to the \"Contact Us\" form.  For example, methods to `enterName()`, `enterEmail()`, `enterSubject()`, `enterMessage()`, `clickSubmit()`, and `getSuccessMessage()`.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use explicit waits with polling to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met. This helps handle timing issues and asynchronous operations. Example: `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, \"success-message\")))`\n        *   **Self-Healing:** Implement logic to automatically retry element interactions or re-locate elements if they are not found initially. (Use with caution, ensure root cause is addressed.)\n        *   **Stale Element Reference Exception:** Catch `StaleElementReferenceException` and re-locate the element before attempting to interact with it again.  This happens when the DOM changes after the element is located.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** `https://automationexercise.com/contact_us`\n        *   Focus on exploring different combinations of valid and invalid input data.\n        *   Explore different browser and device configurations.\n    *   **Secondary Target:** The main page `https://automationexercise.com/`\n        *  Ensure the \"Contact Us\" button/link on the main page is functioning and redirects correctly.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for the Contact Us page.\n        *   The \"Success!\" message (or equivalent) is displayed after successful form submission.\n        *   The correct error messages are displayed for invalid input.\n        *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for functional testing of the Contact Us form on AutomationExercise.com. It will be reviewed and updated regularly to adapt to changes in the application and business requirements."
