  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Automation Exercise - \"Contact Us\" Form\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the \"Contact Us\" form functionality on the Automation Exercise website (https://automationexercise.com/). It provides a comprehensive plan for testing, addressing risk, defining scope, and guiding the engineering team in building a robust and reliable automated test suite.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The website presents general web application scenarios. The \"Contact Us\" form, while not directly revenue-generating, is crucial for customer communication and support, impacting user satisfaction and brand reputation.\n\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High Risk:** Failure of the \"Contact Us\" form to submit correctly, resulting in lost customer inquiries, potential business opportunities missed, and negative customer experience.\n    *   **Medium Risk:** Incorrect data validation (e.g., allowing invalid email formats), leading to data quality issues and potential security vulnerabilities.\n    *   **Low Risk:** Minor UI issues or cosmetic defects within the form that do not impede functionality.\n\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of the \"Contact Us\" form submission process.\n        *   Validation of all input fields (Name, Email, Subject, Message) with positive and negative test cases.\n        *   Verification of the success message displayed upon successful submission.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n        *   Responsiveness testing (desktop and mobile).\n\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Server-side processing and storage of submitted data (backend testing).\n        *   Integration with external systems (e.g., email notification services).\n        *   Performance testing of the form submission process.\n        *   Security testing beyond basic input validation (e.g., penetration testing).\n        *   Accessibility testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n    *   **Test Case:** Navigate to the \"Contact Us\" page, fill out the form with valid data, submit the form, and verify the \"Success!\" message is displayed.\n    *   **Data Strategy:** Use static, predefined data for Smoke tests. This should be a simple \"happy path\" scenario.\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the basic functionality of the form is operational.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        *   **Positive Testing:**\n            *   Submit the form with valid data in all fields.\n            *   Test with various character sets in the Name, Subject, and Message fields (e.g., alphanumeric, special characters).\n            *   Test with maximum allowed characters in each field (if applicable).\n        *   **Negative Testing:**\n            *   Submit the form with empty fields.\n            *   Submit the form with invalid email addresses (e.g., missing \"@\" symbol, invalid domain).\n            *   Submit the form with excessively long text in the Message field.\n            *   Attempt to inject HTML or JavaScript code into the input fields (basic security testing).\n        *   **Boundary Value Analysis:**\n            *   Test the Name, Subject, and Message fields with the minimum and maximum allowed characters.\n    *   **Data Strategy:** A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used for the Regression Suite.\n        *   **Static Data:**  Common email addresses and names for repeated testing.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:**  Utilize Faker libraries or similar tools to generate realistic test data (e.g., names, email addresses, subjects, messages).\n    *   **Goal:** Thoroughly test the \"Contact Us\" form's functionality, data validation, and error handling capabilities.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement the POM design pattern to create reusable and maintainable test code.\n        *   **ContactUsPage:**  Encapsulates the locators and methods related to the \"Contact Us\" page (e.g., input fields, submit button, success message).\n    *   **Programming Language:** Suggest Java or Python (based on team's skill set).\n    *   **Test Framework:** JUnit or pytest (depending on language choice)\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous behavior or loading delays. Example: Wait for the \"Success!\" message to appear with a timeout of 10 seconds, checking every 500 milliseconds.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to become visible or interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Optional):** Explore self-healing capabilities to automatically identify and update broken locators. Tools like Selenium IDE's self-healing plugin can be considered.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n\n    1.  **Contact Us Page:**  Focus on exploring the input fields (Name, Email, Subject, Message) and the \"Submit\" button.\n    2.  **Error Handling:**  Specifically target the error messages displayed when invalid data is entered.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    *   **Successful Submission:**\n        *   HTTP Response Code: 200 OK\n        *   Visibility of the \"Success!\" message on the page.\n        *   Absence of any error messages related to form submission.\n    *   **Data Validation:**\n        *   Error messages are displayed for invalid input in each field.\n        *   The correct error message is displayed for each validation rule violation (e.g., \"Please enter a valid email address\").\n    *   **UI Verification:**\n        *   All labels and input fields are correctly displayed and aligned.\n        *   The \"Submit\" button is enabled/disabled based on input validation rules (e.g., disabled if required fields are empty).\n*   **Test Data Mining:**\n        *   Explore different length test data in each input box.\n        *   Explore different character types (e.g. ASCII, Unicode, etc.)\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for automating the testing of the \"Contact Us\" form on the Automation Exercise website. By adhering to this plan, the engineering team can build a reliable and comprehensive test suite that ensures the quality and stability of this critical functionality."
