As such, core functionality like authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout are critical to business success.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nGiven the nature of e-commerce, potential failure points include:\n*   **Financial Loss:** Errors in pricing, tax calculation, or payment processing.\n*   **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Issues with product availability, cart management, or order fulfillment.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Security vulnerabilities leading to data breaches or compromised transactions.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   All functional aspects of user login, product browsing, adding items to the cart, checkout process, and payment simulation.\n    *   UI elements relevant to the core user flows.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Performance testing (load, stress).\n    *   Security penetration testing (except for basic vulnerability checks in authentication).\n    *   Detailed UI/UX testing beyond core functionality.\n    *   API testing (unless directly impacting the defined user flows).\n    *   Mobile app testing (if only a web application exists).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the system's basic health after a deployment or code change.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Successful Login:** Attempt to login with known valid credentials (`standard_user` / `secret_sauce`).\n    2.  **Homepage Load:** Verify that the product listing page loads successfully after login.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After every build/deployment to the test environment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** If any smoke test fails, the build is rejected.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Purpose:** To ensure that new changes haven't broken existing functionality and that the system continues to meet requirements.\n*   **Test Areas & Examples:**\n\n    *   **Authentication Module:**\n        *   Login with valid and invalid credentials.\n        *   Password reset flow.\n        *   Account locking after multiple failed login attempts.\n    *   **Product Catalog Module:**\n        *   View product details.\n        *   Search for products using various keywords.\n        *   Filter products by price, category, etc.\n        *   Sort products by different criteria (price, name).\n        *   Verify pagination.\n    *   **Shopping Cart Module:**\n        *   Add items to the cart.\n        *   View cart summary.\n        *   Update quantity of items in the cart.\n        *   Remove items from the cart.\n        *   Add out-of-stock items (verify error message).\n        *   Verify cart persistence across sessions.\n    *   **Checkout & Payments Module:**\n        *   Complete purchase with valid data.\n        *   Apply valid and invalid coupon codes.\n        *   Simulate payment failures.\n        *   Verify tax and shipping calculations.\n        *   Verify address validation.\n\n*   **Regression Test Prioritization**:\n    *   P0: Tests covering critical business flows (e.g., login, adding items to cart, checkout).\n    *   P1: Tests covering important but non-critical flows (e.g., product filtering, coupon application).\n    *   P2: Tests covering edge cases, less frequently used features.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each sprint or significant code change.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n\n    *   **Test Data**: The application has limited user roles so we can use both static and dynamic data.\n        *   **Static Data:** Predefined user credentials (`standard_user`, `secret_sauce`) and a small set of product details (name, description, price).\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Generate unique usernames/emails for registration testing and modify quantities/addresses as needed.\n    *   **Data Storage**: Test data will be stored in a dedicated data file (e.g., JSON, CSV) separate from the test code.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Language:** Java or Python (Based on team skill set)\n    *   **Test Runner:** JUnit (Java) or Pytest (Python)\n    *   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ (Java) or Pytest Assertions (Python)\n    *   **Web Driver:** Selenium WebDriver\n    *   **Design Pattern:** Page Object Model (POM)\n        *   Each page in the application should have a corresponding Page Object class.\n        *   Page Objects encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n        *   Tests interact with Page Objects to perform actions and verify results.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before performing actions.\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions to retry assertions for a short period of time, allowing elements to stabilize.\n        *   **Self-Healing:** Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically locate elements using alternative locators if the primary locator fails.  Consider using relative locators.\n    *   **Error Handling:**\n        *   Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and log informative error messages.\n        *   Use try-catch blocks to gracefully handle unexpected errors and prevent test failures.\n        *   Take screenshots and capture page source code on test failures to aid in debugging.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n\n    1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/` (Verify login functionality).\n    2.  **Inventory Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html` (Verify product listing and sorting).\n    3.  **Cart Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html` (Verify adding/removing items and checkout navigation).\n    4.  **Checkout Pages:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-one.html`, `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html`, `https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-complete.html` (Verify checkout steps and order confirmation).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Successful Login:** HTTP 200 status code AND presence of the \"Products\" text on the inventory page.\n    *   **Product Sorting:** Verify that products are sorted correctly by price (low to high).\n    *   **Add to Cart:** Verify that the item count in the cart icon increments correctly.\n    *   **Checkout Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND presence of the \"Thank you for your order!\" text on the confirmation page.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input (e.g., incorrect login credentials, invalid coupon code).\n```"
