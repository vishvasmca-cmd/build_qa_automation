Here's a Master Test Strategy document for `https://example.com`, focusing on regression testing and designed to guide the entire engineering team.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Regression Testing for `https://example.com`\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** `https://example.com`\n**Business Domain:** Generic Web Application\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSince the business domain is generic, we'll assume a standard web application with common functionalities like user authentication, content display, and potentially form submissions.  We will prioritize testing areas based on their potential impact on user experience and data integrity.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of this application could lead to:\n\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Broken functionality or errors can erode user trust.\n*   **Lost Productivity:** If the application is used internally, downtime or bugs can hinder employee efficiency.\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Errors in data handling can lead to incorrect or corrupted information.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Exploitable flaws can expose sensitive data.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All publicly accessible pages and functionalities of `https://example.com`.\n*   User authentication (login, logout, password reset).\n*   Form submissions and data validation.\n*   Navigation and site structure.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n*   Basic security checks (OWASP Top 10).\n*   Error handling and user feedback mechanisms.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, and endurance).  (This may be addressed in a separate strategy).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance). (This may be addressed in a separate strategy).\n*   Detailed security penetration testing. (This may be addressed in a separate strategy).\n*   Third-party integrations (unless explicitly identified as critical).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure the application is fundamentally functional.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify the home page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    *   Verify the login page loads successfully.\n    *   Attempt a login with valid credentials (if applicable).\n    *   Verify a key content page loads successfully (e.g., \"About Us\", \"Contact Us\").\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All tests must pass. Failure of any test will result in build rejection.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect username/password).\n    *   Form submissions with missing or invalid data.\n    *   Inputting data exceeding maximum allowed lengths.\n    *   Attempting to access restricted pages without authorization.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrent user access (simulating multiple users performing the same action).\n    *   Network failures (simulating slow or interrupted connections).\n    *   Empty states (e.g., empty search results, empty shopping cart).\n    *   Handling of special characters in input fields.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  (e.g., try injecting `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into input fields).\n    *   Verify secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., passwords).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** A mix of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:**  A set of pre-defined test users with different roles and permissions.  A set of valid and invalid data for form fields.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:**  Data generated on the fly using random number generators or data factories to ensure uniqueness and avoid conflicts.  This is especially important for fields like email addresses and usernames.\n    *   **Data Management:**  Test data will be stored in a dedicated database or configuration file, separate from production data.  Scripts will be used to reset the test data to a known state before each test run.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class.  This will improve code maintainability and reduce code duplication.\n*   **Language:**  [Choose a suitable language, e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript]\n*   **Testing Framework:** [Choose a suitable framework, e.g., Selenium WebDriver, Cypress, Playwright]\n*   **Assertion Library:** [Choose a suitable library, e.g., JUnit, TestNG, Chai, Jest]\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met, rather than relying on fixed timeouts.  This will reduce flakiness caused by slow loading times.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement mechanisms to automatically retry failed tests or re-locate elements if they are not found.  This could involve using alternative locators or refreshing the page.\n*   **Test Data Management:**  Ensure that test data is properly cleaned up after each test run to avoid conflicts and ensure consistent results.\n*   **Environment Stability:**  Work with the DevOps team to ensure that the test environment is stable and reliable.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Home Page:** Verify all links and content sections are loading correctly.\n2.  **Login/Registration:**  Thoroughly explore the login and registration flows, including password reset functionality.\n3.  **Forms:** Identify all forms on the site (e.g., contact forms, search forms, checkout forms) and explore them with various inputs.\n4.  **Navigation:**  Test all navigation menus and links to ensure they are working correctly.\n5.  **Error Pages:**  Trigger error conditions (e.g., invalid URLs, server errors) and verify that appropriate error pages are displayed.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP status code 200 OK for all pages.\n    *   All expected elements are present on the page (e.g., headings, images, buttons, form fields).\n    *   Text content is displayed correctly.\n    *   Form submissions are successful and data is saved correctly.\n    *   Error messages are displayed when invalid data is entered.\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP status code other than 200 OK.\n    *   Missing or incorrect elements on the page.\n    *   Incorrect text content.\n    *   Form submissions fail.\n    *   Unexpected error messages.\n    *   JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing `https://example.com`. It will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the application.\n"
