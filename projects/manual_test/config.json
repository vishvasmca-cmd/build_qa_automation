It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding the development and execution of comprehensive tests to ensure the application's stability and reliability.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nGiven the generic nature of the domain and the provided URL (`https://example.com`), we will assume a standard web application with common functionalities.  Without specific business context, we will prioritize core web application principles.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nPotential risks associated with application failure include:\n\n*   **Loss of User Trust:** Application instability can lead to a negative user experience and loss of confidence.\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Bugs could potentially corrupt or expose sensitive data.\n*   **Functional Errors:** Broken functionality can disrupt user workflows and lead to errors.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities accessible through the `https://example.com` domain.\n*   Core user workflows (e.g., navigation, form submission, data display).\n*   Negative testing scenarios (e.g., invalid inputs, error handling).\n*   Edge cases (e.g., concurrency, network failures).\n*   Basic security checks (OWASP Top 10 basics).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).\n*   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - unless specifically requested.\n*   Specific third-party integrations (unless explicitly defined and documented).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will provide a rapid health check of the application.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify the home page (`https://example.com`) loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    *   Verify critical elements (e.g., header, footer, main content area) are displayed.\n    *   Verify basic navigation links are functional.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All smoke tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid input validation for all forms (e.g., incorrect email format, exceeding maximum character limits).\n    *   Error handling for common scenarios (e.g., network errors, server timeouts).\n    *   Boundary value analysis for numerical inputs (e.g., minimum and maximum values).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency testing (simultaneous user access to critical resources).\n    *   Network failure simulation (e.g., simulating slow or intermittent connections).\n    *   Empty state handling (e.g., displaying appropriate messages when data is not available).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    *   Verification of secure communication (HTTPS).\n*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**\n    *   Execute tests on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (latest versions).\n    *   Verify consistent rendering and functionality across browsers.\n*   **Responsiveness:**\n    *   Verify the application adapts correctly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n    *   Test on various devices and emulators.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  A set of pre-defined data for common scenarios (e.g., valid usernames and passwords).  This data should be stored securely and managed centrally.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Data generated during test execution to cover a wider range of scenarios (e.g., randomly generated email addresses, unique order numbers).  Consider using libraries like Faker to generate realistic data.\n*   **Data Management:**  Implement a strategy for managing and cleaning up test data to avoid conflicts and ensure test repeatability.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to improve code maintainability and reduce duplication.  Each page of the application should be represented by a Page Object, which encapsulates the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n*   **Test Framework:**  Recommend using a robust and well-supported test framework such as Selenium WebDriver with a suitable language binding (e.g., Java, Python, C#).  Consider using a BDD framework like Cucumber for improved readability and collaboration.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:**  Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met (e.g., an element to be visible, clickable, or present).\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically recover from common test failures (e.g., re-locating elements that have changed).\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage (`https://example.com`):** Verify basic layout, navigation, and content.\n2.  **Any Forms:** Identify and explore all forms on the site (e.g., contact forms, registration forms, login forms).  Focus on input validation and error handling.\n3.  **Navigation Links:**  Explore all navigation links to ensure they are functional and lead to the correct pages.\n4.  **Any Search Functionality:** If present, explore the search functionality with various keywords and filters.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected text and elements are visible on the page.\n    *   Forms submit successfully with valid data.\n    *   Error messages are displayed correctly for invalid data.\n    *   Navigation links lead to the correct pages.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Incorrect data display.\n    *   Broken links.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing the application at `https://example.com`.  It is a living document and should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the application and the evolving threat landscape.\n"
