This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Regression Testing for example.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://example.com\n**Business Domain:** Generic Web Application\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nAs a generic web application, the criticality of different functionalities will vary. However, we will assume a standard risk profile where core functionality failure leads to user dissatisfaction and potential loss of engagement.  We will prioritize testing based on the assumption that the application provides some form of content delivery or interactive service.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the application can result in:\n\n*   **Loss of User Engagement:** Broken pages or features lead to users abandoning the site.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** A consistently unreliable application damages the brand's reputation.\n*   **Potential Financial Loss:** (If the application supports transactions) Failed transactions or inability to access paid content.\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** (If the application handles user data) Corruption or loss of user data.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All publicly accessible pages and functionalities of `https://example.com`.\n*   Core navigation and user flows.\n*   Form submissions and data handling.\n*   Error handling and validation messages.\n*   Basic security checks (OWASP Top 10 basics).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).  (This can be added as a separate phase)\n*   Advanced security penetration testing. (This requires specialized expertise)\n*   Detailed accessibility testing (WCAG compliance). (This can be added as a separate phase)\n*   Third-party integrations (unless explicitly identified as critical).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will provide a rapid health check to ensure the application is fundamentally operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n    *   Verify key text elements are visible on the homepage (e.g., site title, main navigation links).\n    *   (If applicable) Verify login functionality with valid credentials.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid input for form fields (e.g., incorrect email format, special characters in name fields).\n    *   Submitting forms with missing required fields.\n    *   Attempting to access restricted pages without authentication.\n    *   Testing boundary values for numerical inputs (e.g., minimum/maximum allowed values).\n    *   Simulating timeouts or network errors during form submissions.\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Handling of empty states (e.g., no data available to display).\n    *   Concurrency testing (multiple users accessing the same resource simultaneously).\n    *   Testing with large datasets (e.g., uploading large files, displaying long lists).\n    *   Handling of unexpected server errors or exceptions.\n    *   Testing with different character encodings.\n\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    *   Checking for secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers).\n    *   Verifying that error messages do not reveal sensitive information.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:**  A set of pre-defined test data for core scenarios (e.g., valid and invalid usernames/passwords).  This data should be stored securely and version controlled.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:**  Dynamically generated data for scenarios requiring unique values (e.g., unique email addresses, random strings).  Faker libraries or custom data generation functions can be used.\n    *   **Data Management:**  A clear strategy for managing test data is essential.\n        *   Test data should be isolated from production data.\n        *   Test data should be regularly refreshed or reset to avoid data conflicts.\n        *   Sensitive test data should be masked or anonymized.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page or component of the application as a separate class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n*   **Test Framework:**  Choose a suitable test framework (e.g., Selenium WebDriver with JUnit/TestNG, Cypress, Playwright) based on the team's skills and project requirements.\n*   **Reporting:**  Integrate with a reporting tool to generate clear and informative test reports (e.g., Allure Report, Extent Reports).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or conditions to be met before performing actions. This helps to avoid flakiness caused by timing issues.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures (e.g., retrying failed assertions, re-locating elements that have changed).\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for those that are known to be flaky.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify all elements load correctly and links are functional.\n2.  **Navigation Menu:** Verify all menu items are present and navigate to the correct pages.\n3.  **(If applicable) Login Page:** Verify login functionality with valid and invalid credentials.\n4.  **(If applicable) Registration Page:** Verify registration functionality with valid and invalid data.\n5.  **(If applicable) Contact Form:** Verify the contact form submission process.\n6.  **(If applicable) Search Functionality:** Verify search functionality with different search terms.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected text elements are visible on the page.\n    *   Form submissions are successful and redirect to the correct page.\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Missing or incorrect text elements.\n    *   Form submission errors.\n    *   JavaScript errors.\n    *   Unexpected redirects.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing `https://example.com`.  It should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the application and the evolving needs of the business.\n```\n"
