Here's a Master Test Strategy document for `https://example.com`, focusing on regression testing and laying the groundwork for a robust and maintainable automated testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Regression Testing for `https://example.com`\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** `https://example.com`\n**Business Domain:** Generic Web Application\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSince the business domain is generic, we'll assume a standard web application with common functionalities like user authentication, content display, and potentially form submissions. We'll prioritize testing based on the criticality of these functions.  Without specific business context, we'll assume user login and core content display are P0.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of this application could lead to:\n\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Broken functionality leads to a poor user experience.\n*   **Lost Productivity:** If the application supports internal processes, downtime impacts efficiency.\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect data handling can lead to inaccurate information.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Exploitable flaws can compromise user data and system integrity.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All publicly accessible pages and functionalities of `https://example.com`.\n*   User authentication (login, logout, password reset).\n*   Form submissions and data validation.\n*   Navigation and site structure.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest two versions).\n*   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n*   Basic security checks (OWASP Top 10).\n*   Error handling and user feedback mechanisms.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, and endurance).  (Separate strategy required)\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance). (Separate strategy required)\n*   Detailed API testing (unless directly exposed to the user). (Separate strategy required)\n*   Third-party integrations (unless explicitly defined as critical). (Separate strategy required)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure the application is fundamentally operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    *   Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    *   Attempt to log in with valid credentials (if applicable).\n    *   Verify a core content page loads successfully (e.g., \"About Us\").\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All smoke tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect username/password).\n    *   Form submissions with missing or invalid data.\n    *   Input fields exceeding maximum length limits.\n    *   Attempting to access restricted pages without authentication.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users accessing and modifying the same data simultaneously (if applicable).\n    *   Network failures: Simulating network outages during form submissions or data retrieval.\n    *   Empty states: Handling scenarios where data is missing or unavailable.\n    *   Browser-specific quirks: Testing for rendering or functionality differences across browsers.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n    *   Checking for secure handling of sensitive data (passwords, credit card information).\n    *   Verifying proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:**  A set of pre-defined test users with different roles and permissions.  Also, valid and invalid data sets for common form fields (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).\n        *   **Dynamic Data:**  Generated data for unique identifiers, timestamps, and other values that need to be unique for each test execution.  Faker libraries are recommended.\n    *   **Data Management:**  Test data will be stored in a dedicated test database or configuration files.  Sensitive data will be encrypted.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM design pattern to create reusable and maintainable test code. Each page of the application will be represented by a Page Object, which encapsulates the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n*   **Language:**  [Choose a language based on team expertise - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript].\n*   **Testing Framework:**  [Choose a framework based on language - e.g., Selenium WebDriver with JUnit/TestNG (Java), pytest (Python), Cypress/Playwright (JavaScript)].\n*   **Reporting:**  Integrate with a reporting tool to generate detailed test reports (e.g., Allure Report, Extent Reports).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met, rather than relying on fixed timeouts. This helps to reduce flakiness caused by timing issues.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures. For example, if an element is not found, the test can attempt to refresh the page or retry the action.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for tests that are known to be flaky.  Limit the number of retries to avoid infinite loops.\n*   **Environment Stability:**  Ensure the test environment is stable and consistent.  Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to create reproducible test environments.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify basic content and navigation.\n2.  **Login Page:**  Test login functionality with valid and invalid credentials.\n3.  **Registration Page (if applicable):** Test user registration with valid and invalid data.\n4.  **Core Content Pages:**  Explore key content pages to verify content display and links.\n5.  **Form Submission Pages (if applicable):**  Test form submissions with various data inputs.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected text and elements are visible on the page.\n    *   Form submissions are processed successfully (if applicable).\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Missing or incorrect text or elements.\n    *   Form submission errors.\n    *   JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n    *   Unexpected redirects.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust and maintainable automated testing framework for `https://example.com`. It will be reviewed and updated as the application evolves and new requirements emerge.\n"
