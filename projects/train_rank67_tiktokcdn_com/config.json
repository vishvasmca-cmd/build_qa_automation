  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: TikTokCDN.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for smoke testing the TikTokCDN.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding test automation and execution efforts.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** TikTokCDN.com likely serves as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for TikTok's static assets. While not directly customer-facing, its failure impacts TikTok's performance and user experience.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the CDN results in:\n    *   **Performance Degradation:** Slow loading times, impacting user engagement.\n    *   **Content Delivery Issues:** Images, videos, and other assets failing to load.\n    *   **Brand Reputation Damage:** Poor user experience reflects negatively on TikTok.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website accessibility and load times.\n        *   Presence and basic functionality of key UI elements (buttons, links, menus) on the homepage.\n        *   Successful identification of specified UI elements.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of buttons, links, and menus (no clicks).\n        *   Performance testing beyond initial load time.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initial focus on Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initial focus on desktop).\n        *   Error handling and negative scenarios.\n        *   API testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the website loads successfully within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 3 seconds).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible.\n        4.  **Button 3 Presence:** Verify a third button is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify a fourth button is present and visible.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify a fifth button is present and visible.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a link is present and visible.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify a second link is present and visible.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present and visible.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify a second menu bar is present and visible.\n    *   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n*   **Regression Suite (N/A - Smoke Test Only):** No regression testing is performed as part of the smoke test.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the website's pages and UI elements. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Technology Stack:** Recommend using a robust and widely adopted technology stack such as:\n        *   **Language:** JavaScript or Python\n        *   **Test Runner:** Jest or Pytest\n        *   **Assertion Library:** Chai or AssertPy\n        *   **Browser Automation:** Playwright or Selenium\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with reasonable timeouts to handle potential loading delays or asynchronous UI updates. This reduces flakiness. Example: `expect(element).toBeVisible({ timeout: 5000 })`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test cases that are prone to intermittent failures.\n    *   **Element Identification:** Use robust element locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `aria-label`) that are less likely to change with UI updates. Avoid relying solely on CSS selectors or XPath.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`/`):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP 200 status code and successful rendering of the homepage content.\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menus are present and visible on the page. Use `toBeVisible()` or equivalent assertion.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate a clear and concise test report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots or videos of failed test cases for debugging purposes.\n*   **Execution Frequency:**\n    *   Run the smoke test suite after every build deployment to the test environment.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the TikTokCDN.com website. It ensures that critical functionality is verified quickly and efficiently, minimizing the risk of deploying broken builds."
