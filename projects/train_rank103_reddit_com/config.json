  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Reddit.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared by:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing Reddit.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Reddit is a social media platform. Core functionality includes user authentication, content browsing, and community interaction. Failure in these areas can lead to user dissatisfaction, loss of engagement, and potential reputational damage.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. A failure in core functionality can significantly impact user experience and platform usability.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functional testing of individual features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic availability).\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Mobile testing.\n        *   API testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Reddit homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button (or similar) is present and visible on the homepage.\n        4.  **\"Try for Free\" Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button (or similar) is present and visible on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify a fourth button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify a fifth button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a link is present and visible on the homepage.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify a second link is present and visible on the homepage.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present and visible on the homepage.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify a second menu bar is present and visible on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   Smoke tests do not require specific test data. The focus is on UI element presence.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke testing. Consider using a simple assertion library with a browser automation tool (e.g., Selenium, Playwright, Cypress).\n    *   Implement a basic Page Object Model (POM) structure. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars. This will improve maintainability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential loading delays. For example, wait for a button to be present on the page before asserting its visibility.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for website launch failures. This can help mitigate temporary network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  Reddit Homepage (`https://reddit.com`)\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 and page title contains \"Reddit\".\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present in the DOM and are visible on the page. Use appropriate CSS selectors or XPath expressions to locate the elements.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clearly report any failures with detailed error messages and screenshots.\n    *   Track the execution time of each test case.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing Reddit.com. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the website's core functionality is working as expected."
