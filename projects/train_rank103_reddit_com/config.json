  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Reddit.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis:\n\nReddit.com is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Its business criticality lies in maintaining user engagement, content delivery, and community interaction. Failure in these areas can lead to user churn, reputational damage, and potential loss of advertising revenue.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile:\n\nA failure of Reddit.com's core functionality (e.g., inability to access the site, login, or navigate) poses a moderate risk. The primary concerns are:\n\n*   **Loss of User Engagement:** Users may abandon the platform if core features are unavailable.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Outages or critical errors can negatively impact Reddit's brand image.\n*   **Potential Revenue Impact:** If advertising revenue is tied to site availability, outages can directly impact income.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope:\n\n**In Scope (Smoke Test):**\n\n*   Website launch and accessibility.\n*   Identification of key UI elements on the homepage (Login, Signup/GetStarted, 5 other buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n*   Basic UI element presence verification (no interaction).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Clicking or interacting with any UI elements.\n*   Detailed functionality testing (e.g., login process, content posting).\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n*   Mobile testing (initially).\n*   Error handling.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity):\n\nThe smoke suite will focus on verifying the basic health of the Reddit.com website.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Website Accessibility:**\n    *   Objective: Verify the website is accessible and loads successfully.\n    *   Steps: Navigate to `https://reddit.com`.\n    *   Expected Result: The Reddit homepage loads within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n*   **Test Case 2: UI Element Presence:**\n    *   Objective: Verify the presence of critical UI elements on the homepage.\n    *   Steps: After the homepage loads, identify the following elements:\n        *   Login button\n        *   Signup/GetStarted button (or equivalent)\n        *   5 other distinct buttons\n        *   2 distinct links\n        *   2 distinct menu bars\n    *   Expected Result: All specified UI elements are present and visible on the page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite:\n\n*Not applicable for this Smoke Test Strategy.*  A full regression strategy will be defined separately.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy:\n\n*   **Smoke Tests:** No specific test data is required for the smoke tests. The focus is on UI element presence, not data-driven functionality.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation:\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  While this is a smoke test, establishing a POM structure from the outset will facilitate future regression testing. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators for the UI elements being verified.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for the page to load or elements to become visible. This helps mitigate flakiness.  Example: Wait up to 5 seconds for the Login button to be present.\n*   **Locator Strategy:** Prioritize robust locators (e.g., IDs, ARIA attributes) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on page structure) to minimize test breakage due to UI changes.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets:\n\nThe autonomous agent should focus on the following:\n\n*   **Primary Target:** `https://reddit.com` (homepage).\n*   **Secondary Target:**  Inspect the HTML source of the homepage to identify potential alternative URLs for login/signup (e.g., `/login`, `/register`).  These are *not* to be navigated to, but their existence should be noted for future regression testing.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria:\n\n*   **Website Accessibility:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and successful rendering of the HTML content.\n*   **UI Element Presence:**\n    *   The specified UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n    *   Elements are visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS or other means).\n    *   The text content of the Login and Signup/GetStarted buttons (or equivalent) is as expected (case-insensitive match).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing smoke tests on Reddit.com. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on verifying the core functionality and UI elements essential for a positive user experience. This document will be updated as the testing scope expands to include regression and other testing types."
