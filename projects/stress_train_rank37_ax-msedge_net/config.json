  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ax-msedge.net\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for ax-msedge.net, focusing on regression testing to ensure stability and reliability. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, including QAs, Test Architects, and SDETs.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** ax-msedge.net appears to be a general web application. Failure impacts could range from user inconvenience to potential reputational damage.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Given the general nature of the application, the risk profile is medium. System failures could lead to user frustration, lost productivity, and potential negative reviews. Data breaches or security vulnerabilities could have severe consequences.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website loading and rendering across supported browsers and devices.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of identified UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n        *   Basic rendering of content on pages.\n        *   Negative testing on UI elements (e.g., missing elements, broken links).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality behind each button/link (e.g., Login functionality).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   API testing (unless directly related to UI rendering).\n        *   Database testing.\n        *   In-depth security testing (beyond basic OWASP checks).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   Objective: Validate basic website availability and core elements.\n    *   Test Cases:\n        1.  Verify the website loads successfully.\n        2.  Verify the presence of the Login button.\n        3.  Verify the presence of at least one of: \"Signup/GetStarted/Try for Free\" button.\n        4.  Verify the presence of 2 links\n        5.  Verify the presence of 2 menu bars\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   Objective: Ensure recent changes haven't broken existing UI elements.\n    *   Test Cases:\n        *   **Negative Testing:**\n            *   Verify appropriate error messages are displayed if elements are missing or links are broken.\n            *   Attempt to navigate to non-existent pages and verify appropriate 404 messages.\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Test website rendering on different screen sizes and resolutions.\n            *   Simulate slow network connections to ensure UI elements load gracefully (e.g., with placeholders or loading indicators).\n        *   **Security:**\n            *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks: Inspect all input fields on the Login/Signup forms (when in scope in future iterations) for basic SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities using simple payloads (e.g., `' OR '1'='1` and `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).\n            *   Verify the website uses HTTPS.\n        *   **Data Strategy:**\n            *   **Static Data:** Use static data for basic UI validation (e.g., predefined labels on buttons).\n            *   **Dynamic Generation:** Generate dynamic data (e.g., timestamps) when necessary for negative testing (e.g., trying to submit a form with an expired date).\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM)\n    *   Rationale: POM promotes code reusability and maintainability. Define Page Objects for each major page (e.g., HomePage, LoginPage). Each Page Object contains locators and methods to interact with elements on that page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous loading of UI elements.  Example: Instead of `Assert.assertTrue(element.isDisplayed())`, use a polling mechanism like `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id(\"elementId\")))`.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits (WebDriverWait) to wait for specific conditions (e.g., element to be visible, element to be clickable) before interacting with elements. Avoid excessive use of implicit waits, as they can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Consider implementing a self-healing mechanism that automatically retries failed locators using alternative strategies (e.g., XPath fallback if ID fails). This can reduce flakiness caused by minor UI changes.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Focus on verifying the presence and correct rendering of the header, footer, main content area, and navigation elements.\n    2.  **Login Page (if discoverable):** Focus on finding and verifying the presence of form elements, labels, and buttons.\n    3.  **Signup/Get Started Page (if discoverable):** Focus on finding and verifying the presence of form elements, labels, and buttons.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Successful Page Load:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Verify that all required buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page using appropriate locators (e.g., ID, CSS selector, XPath).\n    *   **Correct Rendering:** Verify that UI elements are displayed in the correct position and with the correct styling (e.g., font, color, size). (Automated Visual Testing can assist here, however it is not mandatory to start).\n    *   **Link Functionality:** Verify that links navigate to the expected target URLs. Validate that broken links return a 404 status code."
