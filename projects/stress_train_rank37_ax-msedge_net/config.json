  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ax-msedge.net\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for ax-msedge.net, a general web application. It provides a comprehensive plan for ensuring the quality and stability of the application through rigorous testing practices. This strategy will guide the entire engineering team, including Senior QAs, Test Architects, and SDETs, in their testing efforts.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n**1.1. Domain Analysis:**\n\n*   **Business Domain:** General Web Application (ax-msedge.net).\n*   **Criticality:** While the specific business purpose of ax-msedge.net is not explicitly defined, a general web application's availability and functionality are crucial for user engagement and achieving its intended purpose (e.g., information dissemination, service delivery).\n\n**1.2. Risk Profile:**\n\n*   **Potential Risks:**\n    *   **Functional Defects:** Broken links, non-functional buttons, incorrect page rendering, and accessibility issues can lead to a poor user experience and hinder the application's intended purpose.\n    *   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Although not explicitly in scope for this initial regression test, security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) are always a concern for web applications and should be addressed in subsequent testing phases.\n    *   **Performance Issues:** Slow page load times or unresponsive elements can frustrate users and negatively impact engagement.\n    *   **Availability Issues:** Downtime or intermittent errors can prevent users from accessing the application and achieving their goals.\n\n**1.3. Testing Scope:**\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully.\n    *   **Element Identification:** Verify the presence and basic functionality (e.g., clickable, visible) of the following elements:\n        *   Login button\n        *   Signup/GetStarted button\n        *   Try for Free button\n        *   Any other 2 buttons\n        *   2 Links\n        *   2 Menu Bars\n    *   **Basic UI/UX:** Ensure elements are displayed correctly and are visually appealing.\n\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   **Clicking any buttons or links:** This test focuses solely on the presence and initial state of the elements.\n    *   **Detailed Functionality:** Testing the actual functionality triggered by clicking buttons or links.\n    *   **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing, and performance optimization are excluded from this initial regression test.\n    *   **Security Testing:** Comprehensive security testing (e.g., penetration testing) is out of scope for this initial regression test.\n    *   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Testing on multiple browsers is not included in this initial regression test.\n    *   **Mobile Testing:** Testing on mobile devices is not included in this initial regression test.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n**2.1. Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core functionality of the application after deployment.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    *   Verify the presence of the Login button.\n    *   Verify the presence of at least one menu bar.\n\n**2.2. Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions in existing functionality.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that all specified buttons, links, and menu bars are visible on the page.\n    *   **Element State:** Verify that the buttons and links are in their default state (e.g., enabled, not greyed out).\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Attempt to load the website with an invalid URL (e.g., typo).\n        *   Verify that the website displays an appropriate error message.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Test the website with a slow network connection.\n        *   Verify that the website loads gracefully and displays a loading indicator.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic input validation checks on any input fields (if present) to prevent XSS attacks.\n\n**2.3. Data Strategy:**\n\n*   **Test Data:** For this initial regression test, static test data is sufficient. No dynamic data generation is required.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n**3.1. Framework Recommendation:**\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent the web pages and their elements. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n\n**3.2. Resilience Strategy:**\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to become visible or enabled.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed test cases due to transient network issues or server errors.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n**4.1. Mining Targets:**\n\n*   **Primary Target:** The main landing page of ax-msedge.net (https://ax-msedge.net).\n\n**4.2. Verification Criteria:**\n\n*   **Website Load:**\n    *   HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   The page title is present and contains relevant keywords.\n*   **Element Presence:**\n    *   The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are visible on the page.\n    *   The elements are in their default state (e.g., enabled, not greyed out).\n*   **Error Handling:**\n    *   Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid URLs or other error conditions.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing ax-msedge.net. It will be reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in the application and the evolving testing landscape.\n"
