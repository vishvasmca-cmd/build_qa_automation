  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: Vercel.com - Smoke Test Suite\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for the smoke test suite for vercel.com. This plan is designed to provide a high-level overview of the critical functionalities that must be tested to ensure the stability and basic functionality of the website. This plan will guide autonomous agents in effectively exploring, mining, and verifying critical elements of the Vercel website.\n\n## 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\n*   **Website URL:** [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)\n*   **Business Domain:** SaaS (Software as a Service) - Cloud Platform for web development and deployment.\n*   **Goal of Website:** Vercel aims to provide a platform for developers to deploy, host, and scale web applications with ease. Key aspects include serverless functions, global CDN, and collaboration features.\n*   **Target Audience:** Web developers, front-end developers, full-stack developers, and businesses of all sizes that need a reliable platform to deploy and manage their web applications.\n\n## 3. Testing Scope\n\nThis smoke test suite will focus on the following critical areas:\n\n*   Website Availability & Basic Functionality\n*   Core Navigation\n*   Key User Flow: Homepage to Deployment Initiation\n\n## 4. Smoke Test Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke test suite will consist of the following test cases:\n\n### 4.1. Website Availability Test\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the Vercel homepage is accessible and returns a 200 OK status code.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)\n    2.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200.\n*   **Expected Result:** The website should load successfully and return a 200 OK status code.\n\n### 4.2. Core Navigation Test\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the main navigation links are functional and redirect to the correct pages.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)\n    2.  Identify the main navigation menu (e.g., \"Pricing\", \"Docs\", \"Enterprise\").\n    3.  Click on each main navigation link.\n    4.  Verify that the correct page loads for each link.\n*   **Expected Result:** Each navigation link should redirect to its corresponding page without errors.\n\n### 4.3. Core Flow: Deploy Web Project Initiation\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Description:** Verify the core flow of navigating the homepage, verifying the hero headline, and initiating the deployment process.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)\n    2.  Verify that the hero headline contains the text \"Deploy web projects instantly.\"\n    3.  Locate and click the \"Start Deploying\" button (or similar call-to-action button initiating deployment).\n    4.  Verify that clicking the button redirects the user to a relevant page (e.g., signup page, deployment setup page).\n*   **Expected Result:** The hero headline should match the expected text, the \"Start Deploying\" button should be clickable, and the user should be redirected to a relevant deployment initiation page.\n\n## 5. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents\n\nThe following instructions guide the autonomous agents on prioritizing elements and pages for effective testing:\n\n### 5.1. Homepage Mining\n\n*   **Prioritize Hero Section:** Focus on extracting text from the main hero section, including headlines, sub-headlines, and call-to-action buttons.  These are crucial for understanding the website's primary purpose.\n*   **Identify Navigation Menu:** Extract all links present in the primary navigation menu (header). Pay attention to the `href` attributes for each link.\n*   **Call-to-Action Buttons:** Identify and extract attributes (text, `href`, `onclick` events) of buttons like \"Start Deploying\", \"Get Started\", or any button that appears to encourage immediate user action.\n*   **Footer Links:** Extract links from the website footer. While less critical for initial smoke tests, these provide insights into legal pages, company information, and other resources.\n\n### 5.2. Page-Specific Mining\n\n*   **After Clicking Navigation Links (SMOKE-002):** Once a navigation link is clicked, extract the page title (`<title>`) and any prominent heading elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) to confirm that the correct page has loaded.\n*   **After Clicking \"Start Deploying\" (SMOKE-003):** On the redirected page, extract the page title, heading elements, and form fields.  This confirms the user is on the deployment initiation page and identifies the next steps in the deployment process.\n\n### 5.3. Element Identification Strategy\n\n*   **Prioritize semantic HTML:**  Encourage agents to prefer using semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<button>`) for element identification.\n*   **Use ARIA attributes:** If semantic HTML is lacking, instruct agents to leverage ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-role`) for identifying elements.\n*   **Fallback to CSS Selectors:**  Use CSS selectors as a last resort.  Favor selectors that are less prone to change (e.g., ID-based selectors if available and stable).\n\n## 6. Reporting\n\n*   All test results will be reported in a clear and concise manner, indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n*   Detailed logs should be captured for any failed test cases, including HTTP status codes, error messages, and screenshots.\n\n## 7. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to cover additional core user flows, such as signup, login, and basic project deployment.\n*   Implement cross-browser testing to ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices.\n\nThis Master Test Plan will be continuously reviewed and updated as the Vercel website evolves."
