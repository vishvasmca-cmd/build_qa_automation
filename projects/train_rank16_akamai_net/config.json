  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Akamai.net - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Akamai.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Akamai.net is a critical infrastructure provider for web performance and security. Website availability and core functionality are paramount for maintaining business operations and customer trust.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the Akamai.net website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Inability for potential customers to learn about and engage with Akamai.\n    *   **Business Disruption:** Hindrance to existing customers accessing support and resources.\n    *   **Loss of Sales Opportunities:** Potential customers unable to explore Akamai's offerings.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page rendering.\n        *   Identification of key interactive elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of critical elements (logo, navigation).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links or menu items.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and the core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Akamai.net homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Logo Verification:** Verify the Akamai logo is present in the header.\n        3.  **Button Identification:** Verify the presence of at least five (5) buttons (e.g., Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, Contact Us, Request a Demo).\n        4.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least two (2) links (e.g., \"About Us\", \"Careers\").\n        5.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least two (2) menu bars (e.g., \"Products\", \"Solutions\").\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for smoke testing, as it focuses on element presence and basic page loading.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Akamai.net website. This will improve test maintainability and readability. Each page (e.g., Homepage) should have its own Page Object class.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available. Example: `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, \"logo\")))`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests. This can help mitigate transient issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary entry point and should be the first target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and page title contains \"Akamai\".\n    *   **Element Presence:** Elements (logo, buttons, links, menu bars) are present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n    *   **Button Identification:** Verify that the identified elements are indeed buttons (e.g., using `element.get_attribute(\"type\") == \"button\"` or `element.tag_name == \"button\"`).\n    *   **Link Identification:** Verify that the identified elements are indeed links (e.g., using `element.tag_name == \"a\"`).\n    *   **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify that the identified elements are navigation elements (e.g., using `element.tag_name == \"nav\"` or `element.get_attribute(\"role\") == \"navigation\"`).\n*   **Success Definition:** All smoke tests pass, indicating that the core functionality of the Akamai.net website is operational.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Akamai.net website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality is validated effectively, minimizing the risk of critical issues impacting the business."
