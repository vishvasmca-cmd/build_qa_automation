  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Akamai.net - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Akamai.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Akamai.net is a critical website for a major technology company. Its availability and core functionality are essential for brand reputation, customer acquisition, and business operations.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the Akamai.net website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on Akamai's technical capabilities.\n    *   **Lost Business Opportunities:** Potential customers may be unable to learn about Akamai's services or contact the company.\n    *   **Reduced Customer Satisfaction:** Existing customers may be unable to access support resources or manage their accounts.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of any specific feature or service.\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Akamai.net homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of at least five (5) buttons (e.g., Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, Contact Us, Request a Demo).\n        3.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least two (2) links (e.g., \"Learn More\", \"About Us\").\n        4.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least two (2) menu bars (e.g., \"Products\", \"Solutions\").\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A (This is a smoke test strategy only)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on the presence of elements, not their functionality.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke testing. Consider using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   **Page Objects:** Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitForElementVisible`) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Timeout Management:** Implement appropriate timeouts to prevent tests from hanging indefinitely.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://akamai.net):** Focus on identifying the specified elements on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   Buttons: Verify the presence of at least 5 elements with the `<button>` tag or appropriate ARIA roles.\n        *   Links: Verify the presence of at least 2 elements with the `<a>` tag and an `href` attribute.\n        *   Menu Bars: Verify the presence of at least 2 navigation elements (e.g., `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`) that appear to represent menu bars.\n    *   **Success:** All verification criteria must be met for the smoke test to pass.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Akamai.net website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the website's core functionality is verified quickly and effectively."
