  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Akamai.net - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Akamai.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Akamai.net is a critical website for a major technology company. Its availability and basic functionality are essential for maintaining brand reputation and providing access to key information and services.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the Akamai.net website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on Akamai's technical capabilities.\n    *   **Loss of Potential Leads:** Inability for users to access information or sign up for services can result in lost business opportunities.\n    *   **Reduced Customer Satisfaction:** Existing customers may be unable to access support or product information.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action buttons).\n        *   Identification of 2 links.\n        *   Identification of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of any linked pages or services.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the Akamai.net website is accessible and that key elements are present on the homepage.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Akamai.net website loads successfully in a browser.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify a \"Login\" button (or similar) is present and visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar call-to-action button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" (or similar) button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button Presence (2 Additional):** Verify two additional buttons (e.g., \"Contact Us\", \"Learn More\") are present and visible on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Presence (2):** Verify two links are present and visible on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Verify two menu bars are present and visible on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing. A regression suite will be defined separately for more in-depth testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke testing. Consider using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Create a `HomePage` class that encapsulates the locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars. This promotes maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be present) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial website load in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage:** Focus all smoke tests on the Akamai.net homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and page content loads without errors.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are visible on the page. Use appropriate locators (e.g., XPath, CSS selectors) to identify the elements.\n    *   **No Interaction:** The tests should *only* verify the presence of the elements. No clicking or interaction is required.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots of the homepage in case of failures to aid in debugging."
