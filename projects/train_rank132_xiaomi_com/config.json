  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Xiaomi.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Xiaomi.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Xiaomi.com is a high-traffic e-commerce website. System failures can lead to immediate financial loss (lost sales), damage to brand reputation, and customer dissatisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Failure of core functionalities (website availability, navigation, account access) directly impacts revenue and user experience.\n    *   **Medium:** Issues with secondary elements (specific product pages, non-critical links) can lead to user frustration and potential loss of sales.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic rendering.\n        *   Successful loading of the homepage.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action buttons), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual features (e.g., product purchasing, account management).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile device testing (initially, focus on desktop).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the website is up, running, and the most critical elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        3.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   Login button/link\n            *   Signup/Get Started button/link\n            *   \"Try for Free\" or similar call-to-action button/link\n            *   5 additional buttons (any buttons on the homepage)\n            *   2 links (any links on the homepage)\n            *   2 menu bars (navigation menus)\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for Smoke Testing)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for smoke tests. The focus is on element presence, not data validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the homepage and its elements. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains methods to access and interact with elements on the homepage (e.g., `isLoginButtonPresent()`, `isSignupLinkPresent()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading. This reduces flakiness.\n    *   **Example:** Wait for the Login button to be present for a maximum of 5 seconds before failing the test.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future Consideration):** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically locate elements if their locators change. This is not a priority for the initial smoke tests but should be considered for long-term maintainability.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Availability:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Homepage Load:** Page loads completely without errors.\n    *   **Element Presence:**\n        *   Login button/link is present and visible.\n        *   Signup/Get Started button/link is present and visible.\n        *   \"Try for Free\" or similar call-to-action button/link is present and visible.\n        *   5 additional buttons are present and visible.\n        *   2 links are present and visible.\n        *   2 menu bars are present and visible.\n*   **Success Definition:** All verification criteria are met. If any criterion fails, the build is considered unstable and should be rejected."
