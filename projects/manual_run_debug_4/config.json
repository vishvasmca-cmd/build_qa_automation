My mandate is to create a comprehensive Master Test Strategy for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing and the specific user goal of logging in with the provided credentials. Here's the breakdown:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nSaucedemo.com appears to be a demonstration e-commerce website. While not a real-world business, it simulates typical e-commerce functionalities like login, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout.  The business criticality is *moderate* \u2013 failure doesn't result in real financial loss, but it impacts the demonstration's credibility and user experience.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n*   **Functional Defects:** Incorrect pricing, broken checkout flow, inability to add items to cart.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Exposure of user credentials, XSS vulnerabilities, or other security flaws.\n*   **Performance Issues:** Slow page load times, unresponsive UI.\n*   **Data Integrity:** Incorrect product information, order history discrepancies.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** Login, Logout, Password Reset (if applicable).\n*   **Product Catalog:** Display of products, filtering, sorting.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and modifying items.\n*   **Checkout Process:** Entering shipping information, payment details (simulated), order confirmation.\n*   **User Interface:** Responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   **Error Handling:**  Handling of invalid inputs, edge cases, and unexpected errors.\n*   **Security:** Basic OWASP Top 10 checks (input validation, XSS, SQLi).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing, endurance testing (unless specifically requested).\n*   **Advanced Security Testing:** Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning.\n*   **Integration with external systems:** (Payment gateways, shipping providers) - as this is a demo site.\n*   **Accessibility Testing:** (WCAG compliance) - unless specifically requested.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Purpose:** Verify the core functionality is operational after each build.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to the Saucedemo.com homepage.\n    2.  Login with `standard_user` and `secret_sauce`.\n    3.  Verify successful login (e.g., user is redirected to the product catalog page).\n*   **Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** If any test fails, the build is rejected.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Purpose:** Ensure that new changes haven't introduced regressions and that existing functionality remains intact.\n*   **Test Areas:**\n\n    *   **Authentication:**\n        *   **Positive:** Login with valid credentials (`standard_user`, `secret_sauce`).\n        *   **Negative:**\n            *   Invalid username.\n            *   Invalid password.\n            *   Locked out user.\n            *   Empty username and password fields.\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Attempting to login with special characters in username/password.\n            *   Brute-force login attempts (rate limiting - if implemented).\n\n    *   **Product Catalog:**\n        *   **Positive:**\n            *   Verify product display (name, description, price, image).\n            *   Verify filtering and sorting functionality.\n            *   Add products to the cart.\n        *   **Negative:**\n            *   Attempt to add a product to the cart without being logged in (if applicable).\n            *   Verify error handling when filters/sorts return no results.\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Large number of products in the catalog.\n            *   Products with long names or descriptions.\n\n    *   **Shopping Cart:**\n        *   **Positive:**\n            *   Verify items are added to the cart correctly.\n            *   Verify quantity updates.\n            *   Verify item removal.\n            *   Verify cart total calculation.\n        *   **Negative:**\n            *   Attempt to add more items than available in stock (if applicable).\n            *   Enter invalid quantity values.\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Adding a large number of items to the cart.\n            *   Adding the same item multiple times.\n\n    *   **Checkout Process:**\n        *   **Positive:**\n            *   Complete the checkout process with valid shipping information.\n            *   Verify order confirmation page.\n        *   **Negative:**\n            *   Missing required shipping information.\n            *   Invalid shipping information (e.g., incorrect zip code format).\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Checkout with a very large number of items.\n            *   Checkout with special characters in shipping address fields.\n\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   **Input Validation:**  Test all input fields for XSS vulnerabilities (e.g., try injecting `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).\n        *   **SQL Injection:**  Test input fields for SQL injection vulnerabilities (e.g., try injecting `' OR '1'='1`).\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use predefined usernames and passwords (e.g., `standard_user`, `secret_sauce`, `locked_out_user`).\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Generate random data for shipping addresses (names, addresses, zip codes) to avoid data duplication and increase test coverage.  Consider using libraries like Faker.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to improve code maintainability and reduce code duplication.  Each page of the application should have its own Page Object class, which encapsulates the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or conditions to be met before proceeding with the test. This helps to avoid false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n    *   **Self-Healing:**  Explore self-healing techniques to automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring these pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  `https://www.saucedemo.com/` - Focus on all input fields and the login button.\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:** (After successful login) - Explore product listings, filtering options, and \"Add to Cart\" buttons.\n3.  **Shopping Cart Page:** - Explore quantity updates, item removal, and the \"Checkout\" button.\n4.  **Checkout Information Page:** - Explore all input fields for shipping information.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Login:** HTTP 200 status code AND the presence of the product catalog page elements (e.g., product listings, filter options).\n*   **Product Added to Cart:** HTTP 200 status code AND the cart icon displays the correct number of items.\n*   **Checkout Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND the presence of an order confirmation message.\n*   **Negative Test Cases:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs (e.g., \"Username is required\", \"Password is required\").\n\n```\n\nThis document provides a solid foundation for the testing effort.  Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and new requirements emerge. Good luck!\n"
