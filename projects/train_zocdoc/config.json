This plan prioritizes rapid execution and identification of critical issues.\n\n### 2. Domain Information\n\n*   **Website URL:** [https://www.zocdoc.com](https://www.zocdoc.com)\n*   **Business Domain:** Healthcare. Zocdoc connects patients with doctors and medical professionals, allowing users to search for, schedule, and manage appointments online.\n*   **Key Functionality:** Doctor search, appointment scheduling, provider profiles, insurance verification.\n*   **User Goal (as defined):** Navigate to Zocdoc homepage, verify hero headline, find and click the 'Find a Doctor' button.\n\n### 3. Scope\n\nThis test plan covers the smoke testing of the following core areas:\n\n*   Website availability and basic functionality.\n*   Homepage content verification.\n*   Core navigation (clicking the \"Find a Doctor\" button).\n\n### 4. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe Smoke Suite is designed to quickly verify the critical path and core functionalities of Zocdoc.com.  It aims to answer the question, \"Is the site up and basically working?\".\n\n**4.1 Test Cases:**\n\n| Test Case ID | Description                                                                            | Priority | Pre-Conditions                                            | Steps                                                                                                                                            | Expected Result                                                                                           |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SMOKE-001    | **Website Availability & Load**                                                        | High     | None                                                      | 1. Navigate to https://www.zocdoc.com                                                                                                              | 1. The website loads successfully within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).  No server errors (e.g., 500, 404). |\n| SMOKE-002    | **Homepage Headline Verification**                                                      | High     | SMOKE-001 Passed                                         | 1. Verify the main hero headline text is present.                                                                                                   | 1. The hero headline contains the text 'Book an appointment with a doctor near you'.                                    |\n| SMOKE-003    | **Find a Doctor Button Click**                                                             | High     | SMOKE-001 Passed                                         | 1. Locate the 'Find a Doctor' button on the homepage.  2. Click the 'Find a Doctor' button.                                                                      | 1. User is redirected to the doctor search page.                                           |\n\n**4.2 Entry Criteria:**\n\n*   The Zocdoc.com website is deployed and accessible.\n\n**4.3 Exit Criteria:**\n\n*   All smoke test cases have been executed.\n*   All High priority test cases have passed.\n\n### 5. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the automated agent on which elements to prioritize for mining and data extraction.  This ensures the agent focuses on relevant areas for future, more in-depth testing.\n\n*   **Homepage:**\n    *   **Hero Headline:**  Extract the exact text of the main headline displayed on the homepage. This is critical for verifying marketing messaging and site consistency.  Identify the HTML element used for this headline (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`).\n    *   **'Find a Doctor' Button:** Extract the `href` attribute (the link it points to) and the exact text displayed on the button.  Identify the CSS selector or XPath for locating this button.\n    *   **Prominent Images/Banners:** Note the `src` attributes of any key images or banners on the homepage.  This is useful for visual regression testing in the future.\n    *   **Navigation Menu:**  Extract the text and `href` attributes of all main menu items.  This allows for future navigation testing and link validation.\n\n*   **Doctor Search Page (Target Page of SMOKE-003):**\n    *   **Search Input Fields:** Identify and extract properties (name, ID, placeholder text) of all input fields related to searching for doctors (e.g., specialty, location, insurance).  These are essential for more comprehensive search functionality testing.\n\n### 6. Automation Considerations\n\n*   **Element Locators:** Use robust and reliable element locators (e.g., ID, CSS selectors) that are less prone to changes. Avoid XPath unless absolutely necessary.\n*   **Wait Mechanisms:** Implement explicit waits to handle dynamic content and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Reporting:**  Configure the automation framework to provide clear and detailed test reports, including screenshots of failures.\n*   **Environment:** Ensure the automation environment is stable and matches the target testing environment.\n\n### 7. Test Data\n\n*   The smoke test should use default/generic data that is readily available and does not require specific user accounts or credentials.\n\n### 8. Risks and Mitigation\n\n*   **Website Changes:**  Frequent changes to the website's UI may require adjustments to element locators and test scripts.  *Mitigation:  Implement a robust element identification strategy and monitor the website for changes.*\n*   **Environment Issues:**  Instabilities in the test environment can lead to false failures.  *Mitigation:  Ensure the test environment is properly configured and monitored.*\n\n### 9. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the test suite to include more comprehensive functional testing, including user registration, appointment scheduling, and insurance verification.\n*   Implement performance testing to ensure the website meets performance requirements.\n*   Incorporate accessibility testing to ensure the website is usable by people with disabilities.\n```"
