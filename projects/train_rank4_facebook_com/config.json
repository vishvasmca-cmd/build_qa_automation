  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Facebook.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing Facebook.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests to ensure the core functionality of the application is operational.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Facebook.com is a high-traffic social networking platform. Its core functions (login, signup, basic navigation) are critical for user engagement and business operations.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities can lead to significant user dissatisfaction, loss of user trust, and potential revenue impact (ad impressions, etc.). A data breach due to login issues is a critical risk.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, and 5 other buttons.\n        *   Identification of 2 links.\n        *   Identification of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of any button, link, or menu item.\n        *   Negative testing (invalid login attempts, etc.).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Mobile testing.\n        *   API testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health of the Facebook.com website.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Launch and Basic Elements**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://facebook.com`.\n        2.  Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        3.  Verify the presence of the Login button.\n        4.  Verify the presence of the Signup/Get Started button.\n        5.  Verify the presence of 5 other buttons (any buttons on the page).\n        6.  Verify the presence of 2 links (any links on the page).\n        7.  Verify the presence of 2 menu bars (any menu bars on the page).\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy, not a regression strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No test data is required for this smoke test. The tests only verify the presence of elements, not their functionality.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   Implement a basic Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` object representing the Facebook.com homepage.\n    *   The `HomePage` object should contain methods to:\n        *   Verify page load success.\n        *   Locate and verify the presence of the Login button.\n        *   Locate and verify the presence of the Signup/Get Started button.\n        *   Locate and verify the presence of other buttons, links and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts (e.g., 10 seconds) to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to locate them.\n        *   Implement retry mechanisms for element location in case of intermittent loading issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** `https://facebook.com`\n    *   The autonomous agent should focus on identifying the specified elements (Login, Signup, buttons, links, menu bars) on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 OK response when navigating to `https://facebook.com`.\n        *   The Login button is present and visible on the page.\n        *   The Signup/Get Started button is present and visible on the page.\n        *   5 other buttons are present and visible on the page.\n        *   2 links are present and visible on the page.\n        *   2 menu bars are present and visible on the page.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   Any HTTP error (e.g., 404, 500).\n        *   Any of the required elements (Login, Signup, buttons, links, menu bars) are not found or are not visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing Facebook.com. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality of the application is regularly verified, minimizing the risk of critical failures."
