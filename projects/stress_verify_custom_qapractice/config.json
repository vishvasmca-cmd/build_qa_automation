  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Regression Testing for testpages.herokuapp.com\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for regression testing the application hosted at `https://testpages.herokuapp.com/`. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding the development and execution of robust and reliable regression tests.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: The target application appears to be a general-purpose web application designed for testing various web functionalities. While not directly tied to a specific business domain like e-commerce or healthcare, its stability is crucial for developers and testers who rely on it for learning and experimentation. The \"Basic JavaScript Alerts\" functionality is a key component for demonstrating and testing JavaScript interactions.\n\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**: Failure of this application, particularly the JavaScript functionality, could lead to:\n\n    *   **Loss of Trust**: Users may lose confidence in the application's reliability for testing purposes.\n    *   **Impeded Learning**: Broken functionality hinders the learning process for developers and testers.\n    *   **Incorrect Test Results**: Flaws in the application can lead to inaccurate or misleading test results.\n\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   All functionalities related to \"Basic JavaScript Alerts\" page.\n        *   Positive and negative scenarios for JavaScript alert interactions (Alert, Confirm, Prompt).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility for core functionalities.\n        *   Accessibility testing (basic checks).\n        *   Performance testing (page load times).\n        *   Error handling and validation messages.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Extensive performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n        *   Advanced security testing beyond basic input validation.\n        *   Third-party integrations (if any).\n        *   Other pages on the website outside of the \"Basic JavaScript Alerts\" flow.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis section details the specific testing strategies to be employed.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n\n    *   **Purpose**: To ensure the core functionality of the application is operational before deeper regression testing.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  Navigate to `https://testpages.herokuapp.com/`.\n        2.  Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        3.  Click on the \"Basic JavaScript\" link.\n        4.  Verify the \"Basic JavaScript Alerts\" page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        5.  Verify the presence of the Alert, Confirm, and Prompt buttons.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**:\n\n    *   **Negative Testing**:\n        *   **Alert**: Attempt to interact with the alert without clicking \"OK\". Verify no errors occur.\n        *   **Confirm**: Click \"Cancel\" instead of \"OK\". Verify the correct message is displayed.\n        *   **Prompt**: Enter invalid data types (e.g., special characters, long strings) into the prompt. Verify appropriate error handling.  Leave the prompt blank and click \"OK\".\n    *   **Edge Cases**:\n        *   **Concurrency**: Simulate multiple users interacting with the alerts simultaneously (if applicable).\n        *   **Network Failures**: Simulate network interruptions during alert interactions.\n        *   **Empty States**: Verify the behavior when no input is provided in the prompt.\n    *   **Security**:\n        *   **OWASP Top 10 Basics**:\n            *   **Input Validation**: Sanitize user input in the prompt to prevent XSS attacks.\n    *   **Specific Alert Testing**:\n        *   **Alert**: Click the \"Show alert box\" button. Verify the alert appears with the expected message. Click \"OK\" to dismiss the alert.\n        *   **Confirm**: Click the \"Show confirm box\" button. Verify the confirm box appears with the expected message. Click \"OK\" and verify the correct message is displayed. Click \"Cancel\" and verify the correct message is displayed.\n        *   **Prompt**: Click the \"Show prompt box\" button. Verify the prompt box appears with the expected message. Enter text into the prompt and click \"OK\". Verify the entered text is displayed. Click \"Cancel\" and verify the correct message is displayed.\n\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n\n    *   **Static Data**: Use predefined, static data for basic positive and negative scenarios.\n    *   **Dynamic Generation**: Generate dynamic data (e.g., random strings) for more complex scenarios and boundary value testing.  This is especially important for the Prompt functionality.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent the \"Basic JavaScript Alerts\" page and its elements (buttons, alerts, confirm boxes, prompts). This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n\n    *   **Flakiness Handling**:\n        *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous operations like alert appearance and dismissal.\n        *   **Explicit Waits**: Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing**:\n        *   Implement mechanisms to automatically retry failed interactions (e.g., clicking a button) after a short delay.\n        *   Consider using element locators that are less prone to changes (e.g., using data attributes instead of CSS classes).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n\n    1.  `https://testpages.herokuapp.com/`: Landing page.\n    2.  `https://testpages.herokuapp.com/basic_javascript.html`: \"Basic JavaScript Alerts\" page.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes**: Verify that all page requests return HTTP 200 (OK).\n    *   **Element Presence**: Verify that all expected elements (buttons, alerts, confirm boxes, prompts) are present on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification**: Verify that the correct messages are displayed in alerts, confirm boxes, and prompts.\n    *   **Functional Correctness**: Verify that the alerts, confirm boxes, and prompts behave as expected according to the test scenarios.\n    *   **No JavaScript Errors**: Ensure no JavaScript errors are thrown during alert interactions.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing the target application. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure the delivery of a stable and reliable testing environment."
