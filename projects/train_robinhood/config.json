  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan draft for Robinhood.com, specifically tailored for guiding autonomous testing agents with a focus on the specified user goal and smoke testing requirements.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Robinhood.com (Smoke Test)\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis Master Test Plan outlines the strategy for smoke testing Robinhood.com. The goal is to ensure the website is operational, core navigation functions correctly, and a critical user flow (navigating to the homepage, verifying key content, and initiating sign-up) is executable.  This plan will guide the automated agents in performing the defined tests.\n\n**2. Domain Information & Business Analysis**\n\n*   **Website URL:** [https://robinhood.com](https://robinhood.com)\n*   **Business Domain:** Banking/Financial Services (specifically, investment platform)\n*   **Business Goal:** Robinhood's primary goal is to democratize investing by providing an easy-to-use platform for trading stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptocurrencies. They aim to attract new investors, particularly those who are new to the stock market.\n*   **Target Audience:** Individuals interested in investing, with a focus on beginners and those seeking a commission-free trading platform.\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   Commission-free trading of stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptocurrencies.\n    *   Mobile-first platform (iOS and Android apps).\n    *   Educational resources for investors.\n    *   Cash Management features (e.g., debit card, interest-bearing accounts).\n    *   Retirement Accounts (IRAs)\n*   **Testing Considerations:** Given the financial nature of the platform, accuracy, security, and data integrity are paramount. Accessibility is also important to reach a wide range of potential users.\n\n**3. Scope**\n\nThis test plan covers smoke testing of the Robinhood.com website. It focuses on the essential functionality required for a new user to access the platform and begin the sign-up process.  More comprehensive testing (e.g., functional, regression, performance, security) will be addressed in separate test plans.\n\n**4. Test Objectives**\n\n*   Verify the website is accessible and loads correctly.\n*   Confirm core navigation links are functional.\n*   Validate the presence of key content on the homepage.\n*   Ensure the \"Sign Up\" button is present and functional.\n*   Verify the user can navigate to the sign-up flow.\n\n**5. Smoke Test Suite Definition**\n\nThe Smoke Test Suite will consist of the following test cases:\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Website Availability**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the Robinhood.com website is accessible and returns a 200 OK HTTP status code.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to [https://robinhood.com](https://robinhood.com).\n        2.  Verify the page loads successfully.\n        3.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The website loads without errors, and the HTTP status code is 200.\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Core Navigation**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the main navigation links are present and navigate to the correct pages.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to [https://robinhood.com](https://robinhood.com).\n        2.  Locate the main navigation menu (e.g., using `nav` HTML tag or specific CSS selectors).\n        3.  Identify the following links (or similar, depending on the exact wording on the site): Products, Learn, Support\n        4.  Click each link and verify that the page loads successfully.\n    *   **Expected Result:** All navigation links are present and redirect to the correct corresponding pages.\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Core Flow - Homepage Content and Sign-Up Initiation**\n    *   **Description:** Verify key content on the homepage and the functionality of the \"Sign Up\" button.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to [https://robinhood.com](https://robinhood.com).\n        2.  Verify the hero headline contains the text \"Investing for everyone\".  (Agent should use fuzzy matching for near matches)\n        3.  Locate the \"Sign Up\" button (Agent should look for `a` or `button` tags that contains \"Sign Up\" using fuzzy matching).\n        4.  Click the \"Sign Up\" button.\n        5.  Verify that the user is redirected to the sign-up page (e.g., by checking the URL or the presence of specific elements on the page, like a form with \"First Name\", \"Last Name\" fields.)\n    *   **Expected Result:** The homepage displays the correct headline. The \"Sign Up\" button is clickable, and the user is redirected to the sign-up page.\n\n**6. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents**\n\nThe following instructions are critical for guiding the autonomous agents in effectively discovering and interacting with elements on the page.\n\n*   **Prioritize Homepage Analysis:** The agent should aggressively mine the homepage ([https://robinhood.com](https://robinhood.com)) for all text content, links, and buttons.\n*   **Fuzzy Matching for Text:** When verifying text content (e.g., the hero headline), use fuzzy matching to account for slight variations in wording or formatting.  For example, \"Invest for everyone\" should still be considered a match.\n*   **\"Sign Up\" Button Identification:** The agent should search for the \"Sign Up\" button using multiple strategies:\n    *   Look for `<button>` or `<a>` tags containing the text \"Sign Up\" (case-insensitive, fuzzy matching).\n    *   Analyze the surrounding HTML structure for visual cues that indicate a primary call-to-action button.\n    *   Inspect the `aria-label` attribute for relevant text.\n*   **Dynamic Content Handling:** Be aware that the website may use dynamic content or A/B testing. The agent should be able to adapt to slight variations in the page layout and content.\n*   **Navigation Element Identification:** The agent should identify navigation elements (menus, links) using semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>`) and common CSS class names (e.g., \"nav\", \"menu\", \"link\").\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations, such as elements not being found or pages not loading correctly.  Log all errors with detailed information for analysis.\n*    **Heuristic Locators:** The agents MUST utilize \"best guess\" methods to locate elements. If an element cannot be found using a standard CSS selector or XPATH, the agent should use text-based location.\n\n**7. Test Environment**\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS (latest version)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n**8. Entry Criteria**\n\n*   The Robinhood.com website is deployed and accessible.\n\n**9. Exit Criteria**\n\n*   All test cases in the Smoke Test Suite have been executed.\n*   All critical defects identified during testing have been resolved.\n\n**10. Reporting**\n\n*   A detailed test report will be generated after each test execution.\n*   The report will include:\n    *   Test case execution status (Pass/Fail)\n    *   Detailed steps performed\n    *   Actual results vs. expected results\n    *   Screenshots (if applicable)\n    *   Defect reports (if any)\n\n**11. Future Considerations**\n\n*   Expand the test suite to include more comprehensive functional testing.\n*   Implement regression testing to ensure new changes do not introduce defects.\n*   Conduct performance testing to assess the website's responsiveness and scalability.\n*   Perform security testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for smoke testing Robinhood.com using autonomous agents. By following the defined instructions and guidelines, the agents can effectively verify the website's core functionality and ensure a positive user experience."
