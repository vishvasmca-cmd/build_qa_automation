  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Fastly.net Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the smoke testing of the Fastly.net website. It provides a clear framework for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Fastly.net is a content delivery network (CDN) and edge cloud platform. Its website serves as a critical marketing and onboarding tool. Failure of the website can lead to loss of potential customers, damage to brand reputation, and disruption of business operations.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Inability to access the website or critical pages (e.g., login, signup) directly impacts business acquisition and customer support.\n    *   **Medium:** Broken links or non-functional buttons can lead to a poor user experience and reduced conversion rates.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Existence and visibility of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action) buttons (at least 5).\n        *   Existence and visibility of at least 2 links.\n        *   Existence and visibility of at least 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the buttons and links (clicking and navigating).\n        *   Performance testing (load times, etc.).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited to a single, primary browser initially).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness testing.\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Error handling and negative scenarios.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the website is up and running and that key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Fastly.net homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Button Visibility:** Verify the existence and visibility of at least 5 buttons (e.g., Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, Contact Us, Request a Demo).\n        3.  **Link Visibility:** Verify the existence and visibility of at least 2 links (e.g., \"Learn More\", \"Documentation\").\n        4.  **Menu Bar Visibility:** Verify the existence and visibility of at least 2 menu bars (e.g., main navigation, footer navigation).\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on the presence and visibility of elements, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke testing. Consider using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   **Rationale:** POM promotes code reusability and maintainability, even for a small suite.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains locators and methods for interacting with the homepage.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Mitigation:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use short polling intervals (e.g., 500ms) with a reasonable timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) to check for element visibility. This helps avoid false negatives due to transient loading issues.\n        *   **Example:** `WebDriverWait(driver, 5).until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, \"login-button\")))`\n    *   **Self-Healing (Optional):** For a smoke test, self-healing is not strictly necessary but can be considered if the website is known to have frequent UI changes.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://fastly.net):** This is the primary target for verifying website launch and the presence of key elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   **Success:** HTTP 200 status code AND the page title contains \"Fastly\" (or a similar relevant keyword).\n    *   **Button Visibility:**\n        *   **Success:** At least 5 buttons are present on the page AND are visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS or JavaScript).\n    *   **Link Visibility:**\n        *   **Success:** At least 2 links are present on the page AND are visible.\n    *   **Menu Bar Visibility:**\n        *   **Success:** At least 2 menu bars are present on the page AND are visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for the smoke testing of Fastly.net. It ensures that the core functionality of the website is verified quickly and efficiently, minimizing the risk of critical failures. This document will be reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in the application or business requirements."
