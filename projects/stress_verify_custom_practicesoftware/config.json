  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: E-commerce Regression Testing - \"AutomationTesting.in\"\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for regression testing the e-commerce website, \"AutomationTesting.in\". It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, ensuring a consistent and comprehensive approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### Domain Analysis: E-commerce\n\nThe target application is an e-commerce platform, making core functionalities like product browsing, adding to cart, checkout, and user account management critical to business success.\n\n*   **P0 (Critical):** Registration, Login, Product Browsing, Add to Cart, Checkout (Payment Processing).\n*   **P1 (High):** User Profile Management, Order History, Search Functionality, Product Reviews.\n*   **P2 (Medium):** Contact Us Form, Newsletter Subscription, Social Media Links.\n*   **P3 (Low):** Blog Section, Minor UI elements.\n\n### Risk Profile\n\nFailure in the e-commerce domain can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Failed transactions, incorrect pricing, inability to process orders.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user reviews, loss of customer trust due to broken functionality.\n*   **Data Security Breaches:** Compromised user data (payment information, personal details).\n*   **Operational Inefficiency:** Increased support requests, manual workarounds, delayed order fulfillment.\n\n### Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   All P0, P1, and P2 functionalities as defined above.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n    *   Responsive design testing (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n    *   Basic security testing (input validation, protection against common web vulnerabilities).\n    *   Performance testing (page load times, server response times).\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Detailed performance testing (load testing, stress testing).\n    *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n    *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n    *   Third-party integrations (unless specifically identified as high-risk).\n    *   Localization testing (unless explicitly requested).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to the homepage and verify the page loads successfully.\n    2.  Navigate to \"My Account\" page.\n    3.  Attempt to register a new user with valid credentials.\n    4.  Attempt to log in with the newly created user.\n*   **Environment:** Staging environment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Registration:** Invalid email formats, weak passwords, missing required fields.\n    *   **Login:** Incorrect username/password combinations, locked accounts.\n    *   **Checkout:** Invalid credit card numbers, expired dates, insufficient funds.\n    *   **Search:** Searching for non-existent products, using special characters.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   **Concurrency:** Multiple users adding the same item to their cart simultaneously.\n    *   **Network Failures:** Intermittent network connectivity during checkout.\n    *   **Empty States:** Empty cart, no search results, no order history.\n    *   **Boundary Analysis:** Maximum quantity of items in cart, maximum length of input fields.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   **Input Validation:** Verify that all input fields are properly validated to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n    *   **OWASP Top 10 Basics:** Focus on preventing common vulnerabilities like broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data Generation:** Utilize a test data generation library (e.g., Faker) to create realistic and varied test data for each test run. This ensures that the tests are not dependent on static data and can handle different scenarios.\n    *   **Data Masking:** Sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, passwords) will be masked or encrypted in the test environment.\n    *   **Data Reset:** The test database will be reset to a known state before each regression test run.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should have a corresponding page object that encapsulates the elements and actions on that page.\n    *   **Language:** Python with pytest.\n    *   **Selenium:** For browser automation.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or conditions to be met before proceeding with the test. This helps to avoid false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically locate elements that have changed their locators. This can be achieved by using multiple locators for each element and trying them in order until one is found.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism to automatically retry failed test cases. This can be useful for handling intermittent network issues or other transient errors.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Prioritized Exploration):**\n    1.  **My Account Page:** Focus on registration and login flows, including error handling and password reset functionality.\n    2.  **Product Listing Page:** Explore different product categories, filters, and sorting options.\n    3.  **Product Detail Page:** Verify product information, add to cart functionality, and related product recommendations.\n    4.  **Shopping Cart Page:** Test adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.\n    5.  **Checkout Page:** Focus on payment processing, shipping address validation, and order confirmation.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all requests return the expected HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 302 Redirect, 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error).\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that all expected elements are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that the correct text is displayed in the appropriate elements.\n    *   **Data Validation:** Verify that data is correctly saved and retrieved from the database.\n    *   **Error Messages:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or unexpected conditions.\n    *   **Functional Correctness:** Verify that the application behaves as expected according to the requirements.\n    *   **Specific Example:** For the \"My Account\" registration flow, success is defined as:\n        *   HTTP 200 OK after submitting the registration form.\n        *   A \"Welcome\" message is displayed on the user's profile page after successful login.\n        *   The user's email address is displayed correctly in their profile.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the business and the application."
