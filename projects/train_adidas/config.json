  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan for adidas.com focusing on the specified smoke testing requirements. This plan is designed to guide autonomous agents in effectively testing the core functionality and user flow.\n\n# Master Test Plan: adidas.com - Smoke Test\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the test plan for a smoke test suite for adidas.com. The primary objective is to verify the core functionality and critical user path on the website. This test will ensure the site is operational and key elements are functioning as expected.\n\n**2. Test Scope**\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Website availability and basic functionality.\n    *   Navigation to the Adidas homepage.\n    *   Verification of key elements on the homepage (Hero Headline, \"Shop Now\" button).\n    *   Clicking the \"Shop Now\" button and verifying navigation.\n\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Detailed testing of all website features.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially, focus on a major browser like Chrome).\n    *   Mobile responsiveness (initially, focus on desktop).\n    *   Error handling and edge cases (focus on the happy path).\n\n**3. Domain Information & Analysis**\n\n*   **Website URL:** [https://www.adidas.com](https://www.adidas.com)\n*   **Business Domain:** E-commerce (Athletic Apparel, Footwear, and Accessories)\n*   **Business Goal:** Drive online sales of Adidas products.\n*   **User Goal:** Navigate to Adidas homepage, verify the hero headline contains 'Impossible is nothing', find and click the 'Shop Now' button.\n*   **Key Considerations:**\n    *   **Homepage is dynamic:** Expect frequent updates to the Hero section and featured products. This plan will account for this.\n    *   **Internationalization:** adidas.com likely has regional variations.  This smoke test will focus on the primary/default region.\n    *   **E-commerce Specifics:** Key elements include product listings, shopping cart, checkout process (though checkout is out of scope initially).\n\n**4. Test Suite Definition: Smoke Test**\n\nThis smoke test suite focuses on verifying the basic health and core functionality of adidas.com.\n\n*   **Test Environment:**\n    *   Browser: Chrome (latest version)\n    *   Operating System: Windows 10/11 or macOS (latest version)\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Availability and Homepage Load**\n        *   **Description:** Verify that the Adidas website is accessible and the homepage loads successfully.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to [https://www.adidas.com](https://www.adidas.com).\n        *   **Expected Result:**\n            *   The Adidas homepage loads within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 5 seconds).\n            *   No HTTP errors are encountered (e.g., 404, 500).\n            *   Basic page structure is rendered correctly.\n\n    *   **Test Case 2: Hero Headline Verification**\n        *   **Description:** Verify that the Hero Headline contains the expected text \"Impossible is nothing\".\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to [https://www.adidas.com](https://www.adidas.com).\n            2.  Locate the main Hero Headline element.\n            3.  Verify that the text within the Hero Headline contains \"Impossible is nothing\".\n        *   **Expected Result:**\n            *   The Hero Headline is present on the page.\n            *   The Hero Headline text contains \"Impossible is nothing\". *Note: Exact match is not required; containing is sufficient.*\n        *   **Notes:** The Hero Headline's exact location and CSS class/ID may change. The agent should use flexible locators (see Strategic Mining Instructions).\n\n    *   **Test Case 3: \"Shop Now\" Button Navigation**\n        *   **Description:** Find and click the \"Shop Now\" button within the Hero section and verify that it navigates to a relevant shopping page.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to [https://www.adidas.com](https://www.adidas.com).\n            2.  Locate the \"Shop Now\" button within the Hero section.\n            3.  Click the \"Shop Now\" button.\n            4.  Verify that the page navigates to a relevant shopping page.\n        *   **Expected Result:**\n            *   The \"Shop Now\" button is present within the Hero section.\n            *   Clicking the button navigates to a valid page on adidas.com (e.g., a category page, a sale page).\n            *   The new page loads successfully.\n        *   **Notes:** The exact target URL of the \"Shop Now\" button may change. Focus on verifying it navigates to *a* shopping page, not a specific URL.\n\n**5. Strategic Mining Instructions**\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agent in prioritizing element discovery and handling potential dynamic changes on the website.\n\n*   **Prioritize Elements within the Hero Section:** The Hero section is the most important area for this smoke test. Focus element discovery efforts within this section first.\n*   **Flexible Locators:**\n    *   **Hero Headline:** Avoid relying on specific CSS classes or IDs for the Hero Headline. Instead, use a combination of:\n        *   Searching for `<h1>` or `<h2>` tags within the Hero section.\n        *   Searching for text that *contains* \"Impossible is nothing\".\n    *   **\"Shop Now\" Button:** Similar to the Hero Headline, use flexible locators:\n        *   Search for `<button>` or `<a>` tags with text that *contains* \"Shop Now\" or similar variations (e.g., \"Buy Now\").\n        *   Prioritize elements that are visually prominent and appear to be call-to-action buttons.\n*   **Handling Dynamic Content:**  Be prepared for the Hero section's content to change.  The agent should not fail the test if the *exact* wording of the Hero Headline or the *exact* URL of the \"Shop Now\" button changes, as long as the core functionality (headline contains \"Impossible is nothing\" and button navigates to a shopping page) remains intact.\n*   **Error Handling:** If an element cannot be found after a reasonable search (e.g., 10 seconds), log a warning but continue the test if possible.\n\n**6. Test Data**\n\n*   This smoke test does not require specific test data.\n\n**7. Reporting**\n\n*   The test results should be reported in a clear and concise manner, indicating:\n    *   Test case passed/failed.\n    *   Any errors or warnings encountered.\n    *   Screenshots of the page in case of failures.\n\n**8. Success Criteria**\n\n*   All test cases in the Smoke Test Suite must pass for the build to be considered stable and ready for further testing.\n\n**9. Future Considerations**\n\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to cover additional critical user flows (e.g., product search, adding to cart).\n*   Implement cross-browser and mobile responsiveness testing.\n*   Add error handling and edge case testing.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for smoke testing adidas.com. By following these guidelines, the autonomous agent can effectively verify the website's core functionality and ensure a positive user experience. Remember to adapt and refine this plan as the website evolves."
