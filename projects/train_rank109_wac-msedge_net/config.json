  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Web Application Health Check (Smoke Test)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://wac-msedge.net\n**Business Domain:** General Web Application\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the initial smoke testing phase of the target web application. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests to ensure the application's core functionality is operational.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** This is a general web application. While specific business criticality is unknown without further context, a non-functional application can lead to user frustration, brand damage, and potential loss of user engagement.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionality (e.g., website launch, finding key elements) can result in immediate user abandonment and negative perception.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Successful website launch.\n        *   Presence and visibility of specified UI elements (5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu bars (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation (e.g., color, font).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health of the application.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Launch & Basic Element Presence**\n        *   **Description:** Verify the website loads successfully and the required UI elements are present.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to `https://wac-msedge.net`.\n            2.  Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n            3.  Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons (e.g., Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, etc.).\n            4.  Verify the presence of at least 2 links.\n            5.  Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars.\n        *   **Expected Result:** The website loads without errors, and all specified UI elements are present and visible.\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this initial smoke test. Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document after the application stabilizes.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test as it focuses on UI element presence.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the web page and its elements. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class representing the target URL.\n        *   Within `HomePage`, define locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n        *   Implement methods to verify the presence of these elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for elements to load. This will reduce flakiness.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://wac-msedge.net`):** This is the primary focus for verifying website launch and element presence.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200 OK for the homepage.\n        *   All specified UI elements (5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present and visible on the homepage.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   Website fails to load (HTTP error codes).\n        *   Any of the specified UI elements are missing or not visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for the initial smoke testing of the target web application. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the application's core functionality is validated before further testing and development efforts are undertaken."
