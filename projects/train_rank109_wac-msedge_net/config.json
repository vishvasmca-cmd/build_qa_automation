  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Web Application Health Check\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: The target URL `https://wac-msedge.net` appears to be a web application, potentially related to Microsoft Edge or a web application container (WAC). Without deeper context, we assume a general web application risk profile.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failure of the application to load or core elements to be present can lead to user frustration, loss of potential users, and damage to brand reputation. Given the Microsoft context, security vulnerabilities are a high-priority risk.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Presence of specified UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, 2 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars).\n        *   Basic rendering of the page layout.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Functionality of the buttons, links, or menu bars (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation (e.g., precise positioning, color schemes).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing beyond basic presence of HTTPS.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**: This is the primary focus of this strategy.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Website Launch**: Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Element Presence**: Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   Login button\n            *   Signup/GetStarted button (or equivalent)\n            *   Try for Free button (or equivalent)\n            *   Two (2) additional buttons (any)\n            *   Two (2) links (any)\n            *   Two (2) menu bars (any)\n*   **Regression Suite**: Not applicable for this initial smoke test strategy.  A regression suite will be defined in a subsequent phase.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   Static data is sufficient for this smoke test. No dynamic data generation is required as we are only verifying the presence of elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**:  Implement a POM structure to represent the web page and its elements. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class representing the `https://wac-msedge.net` page.\n        *   Within `HomePage`, define elements as properties (e.g., `loginButton`, `signupButton`, `menuBar1`, `menuBar2`).  Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify these elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible()`) to handle potential timing issues during page load.  This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Locator Strategy**: Prioritize robust locators (e.g., IDs, data attributes) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on page structure) to minimize breakage due to UI changes.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  `https://wac-msedge.net` (Home Page)\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    1.  **Website Launch**:\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK\n        *   Page Title: Verify the page title is present and relevant (e.g., contains \"Microsoft Edge\" or similar).\n    2.  **Element Presence**:\n        *   Each specified element (buttons, links, menu bars) must be present and visible on the page.  Use assertions like `element.isDisplayed()` or `element.isPresent()`.\n        *   Log a failure for each missing or invisible element.\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   Generate a clear and concise test report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots for failed test cases to aid in debugging.\n*   **Automation Priority**:\n    *   Automate the Smoke Suite immediately.  This will provide a rapid feedback loop for build verification."
