  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. I need to create a Master Test Strategy document for Dyson India (dyson.in), focusing on regression testing for the core navigation and page load functionality. Here's the plan:\n\n```markdown\n# Dyson India - Master Test Strategy (Regression)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nDyson.in is an e-commerce platform specializing in high-end consumer electronics. The core business functions revolve around product discovery, purchase, and customer support.\n\n*   **Criticality:** High. Downtime or functional defects directly impact revenue and brand reputation.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Defects in the purchase flow (e.g., inability to add to cart, payment failures) directly lead to lost sales.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Website errors, broken links, or slow loading times erode customer trust and brand perception.\n*   **Data Security:** While this test strategy focuses on navigation and page load, any vulnerabilities exposed during testing should be immediately reported.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Top-level navigation menu links (Deals, Vacuum & wet cleaners, Hair care, Air purifier, Headphones, Lighting, Support).\n    *   Page load verification for all pages linked from the top-level navigation.\n    *   Handling of the \"Subscribe to Dyson\" popup.\n    *   Basic responsive design checks (page renders correctly on different screen sizes - desktop, tablet, mobile).\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Detailed product page testing (descriptions, specifications, reviews).\n    *   Shopping cart and checkout flow.\n    *   Account management (login, registration, profile).\n    *   Detailed testing of individual product features.\n    *   Performance testing (load, stress).\n    *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n    *   Detailed security testing beyond basic input validation.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed on every build to ensure basic website functionality.\n\n*   **Tests:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.dyson.in/`.\n    2.  Verify the homepage loads successfully (check for the Dyson logo and key elements).\n    3.  Click on the \"Vacuum & wet cleaners\" link in the main menu.\n    4.  Verify the \"Vacuum & wet cleaners\" page loads successfully.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThis suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the defined scope.\n\n*   **Popup Handling:**\n    *   Verify the \"Subscribe to Dyson\" popup appears (if present).\n    *   Verify the popup can be closed using the \"X\" button or a \"No Thanks\" link (if available).\n    *   Verify the popup does not reappear immediately after being closed (cookie/session handling).\n*   **Menu Navigation:**\n    *   For each link in the main menu (Deals, Vacuum & wet cleaners, Hair care, Air purifier, Headphones, Lighting, Support):\n        *   Click the link.\n        *   Verify the correct page loads (check the page title, URL, and key content elements).\n        *   Verify no broken images or links are present on the page.\n        *   Verify basic responsive design (page renders correctly on different screen sizes).\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Attempt to navigate to non-existent pages (e.g., `https://www.dyson.in/nonexistentpage`). Verify a proper \"404 Not Found\" or error page is displayed.\n    *   Inject basic XSS payloads into the URL (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`). Verify the payload is not executed.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Test with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and versions.\n    *   Simulate slow network connections to verify page load behavior.\n    *   Test with JavaScript disabled (to identify any critical functionality that relies solely on JavaScript).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** For this specific regression suite (navigation and page load), static test data is sufficient. No dynamic data generation is required.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication.\n    *   Create Page Objects for:\n        *   Homepage\n        *   Main Menu\n        *   Popup (if present)\n        *   Generic Page (for verifying page load)\n*   **Technology Stack:** Selenium WebDriver (or similar), a suitable programming language (Java, Python, C#), and a testing framework (JUnit, TestNG, pytest).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to load before interacting with them. This helps to avoid false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests. This can help to mitigate intermittent network issues or server-side glitches.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically locate elements even if their locators change slightly.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** `https://www.dyson.in/` (Verify initial load and popup handling).\n2.  **Main Menu Links:** Iterate through each link in the main menu (Deals, Vacuum & wet cleaners, Hair care, Air purifier, Headphones, Lighting, Support).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Page title matches the expected value.\n    *   Key content elements are visible on the page (e.g., headings, images, text).\n    *   No broken links or images are present.\n    *   No JavaScript errors are logged in the browser console.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP status code other than 200 (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Page title does not match the expected value.\n    *   Key content elements are missing or incorrect.\n    *   Broken links or images are present.\n    *   JavaScript errors are logged in the browser console.\n    *   XSS payloads are executed.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing the core navigation and page load functionality of Dyson India. It will be reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in the application and business requirements.\n```\n"
