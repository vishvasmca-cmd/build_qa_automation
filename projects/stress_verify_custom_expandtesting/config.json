  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ExpandTesting.com - Web Inputs Form\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the \"Web Inputs\" form on the ExpandTesting.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, ensuring a comprehensive and robust testing approach.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The target application is a general web application with a focus on form input. While not directly tied to financial transactions, failures can lead to user frustration, data integrity issues, and a negative brand perception.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Data loss or corruption due to incorrect input validation.\n    *   **Medium:** User frustration due to unclear error messages or broken functionality.\n    *   **Low:** Security vulnerabilities leading to data breaches (assuming basic security measures are in place).\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All input fields on the \"Web Inputs\" form.\n        *   Input validation logic (client-side and server-side).\n        *   Error message display and clarity.\n        *   Form submission and data persistence (if applicable).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n        *   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n        *   Accessibility (WCAG compliance - basic checks).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress).\n        *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n        *   Integration with external systems (unless explicitly stated).\n        *   Detailed accessibility audit.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   Navigate to the \"Web Inputs\" form.\n    *   Enter valid data into all required fields.\n    *   Submit the form.\n    *   Verify successful submission (e.g., confirmation message, redirect to a success page).\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Positive Testing:**\n        *   Valid input for all fields (different data types: text, numbers, email, etc.).\n        *   Boundary value testing (min/max lengths, allowed ranges).\n        *   Special characters and international characters.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid input for all fields (e.g., incorrect data types, exceeding maximum lengths, missing required fields).\n        *   SQL injection attempts in text fields.\n        *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) attempts in text fields.\n        *   Empty fields for required inputs.\n        *   Invalid email formats.\n        *   Submitting the form with JavaScript disabled.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency: Multiple users submitting the form simultaneously.\n        *   Network failures during form submission.\n        *   Browser compatibility issues (rendering, JavaScript execution).\n        *   Long text inputs exceeding database limits.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks (SQLi, XSS) on all input fields.\n        *   Input sanitization and output encoding.\n        *   HTTPS protocol verification.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Use a library like Faker.js to generate realistic test data for various input fields (names, addresses, emails, etc.).\n        *   **Data Variation:** Create data sets with different combinations of valid and invalid inputs to cover various scenarios.\n        *   **Data Security:** Ensure sensitive data (if any) is properly masked or encrypted during testing.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the \"Web Inputs\" form as a page object. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   **Example Structure:**\n        *   `pages/WebInputsFormPage.js`: Contains locators for all input fields, buttons, and error messages.  Also contains methods for interacting with the form (e.g., `enterFirstName()`, `enterLastName()`, `submitForm()`).\n        *   `tests/WebInputsForm.spec.js`: Contains test cases that use the `WebInputsFormPage` object to interact with the form and verify expected behavior.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntil()`) to wait for elements to appear or disappear, especially after form submission.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., network errors, intermittent server issues).\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Consider using self-healing locators (if the testing framework supports it) to automatically adjust to minor UI changes.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Navigate to the \"Web Inputs\" form:** This is the entry point for all tests.\n    2.  **Input fields:** Focus on exploring all input fields with different data types and values.\n    3.  **Submit button:** Trigger form submission with various input combinations.\n    4.  **Error messages:** Verify the display and clarity of error messages for invalid inputs.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Successful Form Submission:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code after form submission.\n        *   Redirect to a success page (if applicable).\n        *   Confirmation message displayed on the page.\n    *   **Input Validation:**\n        *   Error messages displayed for invalid inputs.\n        *   Form submission prevented with invalid inputs.\n        *   Data persistence (if applicable) with valid inputs.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   No SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n        *   No XSS vulnerabilities.\n        *   HTTPS protocol enforced.\n    *   **Accessibility:**\n        *   Form elements are properly labeled.\n        *   Keyboard navigation is supported.\n        *   Color contrast is sufficient.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the \"Web Inputs\" form on ExpandTesting.com. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure a high-quality and reliable user experience."
