  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. My mandate is to create a comprehensive Master Test Strategy for the website `https://practice.expandtesting.com/`, focusing on regression testing and the user goal of navigating to web inputs and filling forms. This strategy will guide the entire engineering team and serve as the blueprint for all testing activities, especially before automation begins.\n\nHere's the Master Test Strategy document:\n\n# Master Test Strategy: ExpandTesting.com - Web Inputs Regression\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** `https://practice.expandtesting.com/`\n**Business Domain:** General Web Application (Practice/Demo Site)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe target website, `https://practice.expandtesting.com/`, appears to be a practice or demonstration site for web testing. The specific focus is on web inputs and form filling. While not a critical business application in the traditional sense (e.g., e-commerce), a failure in this area can impact user experience and the perceived reliability of the ExpandTesting platform.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Low Financial Risk:** Direct financial loss is unlikely.\n*   **Low Data Breach Risk:** The site likely uses dummy data, minimizing data breach concerns.\n*   **Medium Trust Loss Risk:** If the input forms are consistently broken or unreliable, users may lose confidence in the ExpandTesting platform as a learning resource.\n*   **High Learning Impact Risk:** If the forms are broken, users will not be able to properly learn how to test web inputs.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All web input fields on the target page (`https://practice.expandtesting.com/`).\n*   Form submission functionality.\n*   Client-side validation (e.g., required fields, format checks).\n*   Error handling and display of error messages.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions).\n*   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n*   Accessibility (basic checks for ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Back-end database testing (unless directly exposed through the UI).\n*   Performance testing (load, stress).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n*   Third-party integrations (if any exist).\n*   API testing (unless directly related to form submission).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will verify the basic functionality of the web input page.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://practice.expandtesting.com/`.\n    2.  Verify that all input fields are present and visible.\n    3.  Enter valid data into all required fields.\n    4.  Submit the form.\n    5.  Verify that a success message is displayed (or the page reloads without errors).\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will cover a wide range of scenarios to ensure the stability and reliability of the web input functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid input values (e.g., non-numeric data in numeric fields, special characters in name fields).\n    *   Missing required fields.\n    *   Input values exceeding maximum length limits.\n    *   Submitting the form with empty fields.\n    *   Testing for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities in input fields (basic checks).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Boundary value analysis (e.g., minimum and maximum allowed values).\n    *   Entering extremely long strings in text fields.\n    *   Testing with different character encodings (e.g., UTF-8).\n    *   Handling of special characters (e.g., <, >, &, \", ').\n*   **Alternative Flows:**\n    *   If the form has optional fields, test with and without those fields populated.\n    *   If there are different input types (e.g., text, number, date, email), test each type thoroughly.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on input fields (SQLi, XSS).\n*   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n    *   N/A (Standalone page)\n*   **Validation Messages:**\n    *   Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input.\n    *   Verify that error messages are clear, concise, and user-friendly.\n    *   Verify that error messages disappear when the input is corrected.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined sets of valid and invalid data for common input types (e.g., valid email addresses, invalid phone numbers).  These will be stored in data files (CSV, JSON).\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generated data for scenarios requiring unique values (e.g., random strings for text fields).  Faker libraries will be used for this purpose.\n*   **Data Storage:** Test data will be stored in version-controlled data files (e.g., CSV, JSON) within the test repository.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to represent the web input page and its elements. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Create a `WebInputsPage` class that encapsulates all the elements and actions related to the web input page.\n    *   Each input field should be represented as a property of the `WebInputsPage` class.\n    *   Methods should be created for common actions, such as entering data, submitting the form, and retrieving error messages.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or enabled before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing capabilities by using relative locators or dynamic element identification strategies.\n*   **Environment Stability:**\n    *   Ensure that the test environment is stable and consistent.\n    *   Use a dedicated test environment that is separate from the development and production environments.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following areas:\n\n1.  **All Input Fields:**  Identify all input fields on the page, including text fields, number fields, date fields, email fields, and any other input types.\n2.  **Form Submission Button:** Locate the form submission button.\n3.  **Error Message Areas:** Identify the areas where error messages are displayed.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   The page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n    *   All input fields are visible and enabled.\n    *   The form can be submitted without errors when valid data is entered.\n    *   Appropriate error messages are displayed when invalid data is entered.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   The page fails to load.\n    *   Input fields are missing or disabled.\n    *   The form cannot be submitted, even with valid data.\n    *   No error messages are displayed when invalid data is entered.\n    *   Incorrect or misleading error messages are displayed.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the web input functionality on `https://practice.expandtesting.com/`. It will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the testing process.\n"
