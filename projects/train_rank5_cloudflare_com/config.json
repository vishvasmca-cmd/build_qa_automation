  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Cloudflare.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Cloudflare.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Cloudflare is a critical infrastructure provider for internet security and performance. Website availability and core functionality are paramount.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the Cloudflare website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust in Cloudflare's reliability.\n    *   **Business Disruption:** Inability for potential customers to access information and services.\n    *   **Financial Impact:** Loss of potential revenue due to service unavailability.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic accessibility (no broken links).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functional testing of individual features.\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress).\n        *   Security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (beyond a single, representative browser).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness testing.\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links or menu items.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is online and the most critical elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button is present on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Generic x2):** Verify two other buttons are present on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Presence (Generic x2):** Verify two links are present on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (Generic x2):** Verify two menu bars are present on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.*  A regression suite will be defined separately for more comprehensive testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for smoke testing, as we are only verifying element presence.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Cloudflare homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   `HomePage` Page Object: Contains locators for the Login, Signup, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with reasonable timeouts to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness due to network latency. For example, wait up to 5 seconds for an element to be present before failing the test.\n    *   **Element Existence Checks:** Before interacting with an element, explicitly check if it exists on the page to prevent `NoSuchElementException`.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`/`):** The primary focus for smoke testing.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage Load:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"Cloudflare\".\n    *   **Element Presence (Buttons, Links, Menu Bars):**\n        *   Element is present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n        *   Element is visible on the page.\n        *   Element is enabled (not disabled).\n*   **Success Definition:** All smoke tests pass, indicating the website is online and the core elements are present and accessible. Failure of any smoke test indicates a critical issue requiring immediate attention."
