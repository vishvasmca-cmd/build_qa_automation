  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Smoke Testing for app-measurement.com\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** `app-measurement.com` falls under the \"general web\" domain. Without further context, we assume it provides application measurement services (analytics, performance monitoring, etc.). The business criticality is moderate; failure to load the site impacts user acquisition and potentially service monitoring.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the core landing page results in:\n    *   **Loss of potential user engagement:** Users cannot access information or sign up.\n    *   **Reputational damage:** A broken landing page reflects poorly on the service.\n    *   **Delayed data collection:** If the site is used for measurement, downtime impacts data gathering.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, menu bars).\n        *   Basic HTTP status code verification.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation (e.g., precise positioning, colors).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Error handling (e.g., 404 pages).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health of the `app-measurement.com` landing page.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **UI Element Presence:** Confirm the existence of the following elements:\n        *   Login button/link\n        *   Signup/GetStarted button/link\n        *   Try for Free button/link (or similar call-to-action)\n        *   Two additional buttons/links (any prominent buttons/links on the page)\n        *   Two menu bars\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for a *smoke* test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.)\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for this smoke test.  Consider using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Create a `HomePage` class representing the `app-measurement.com` landing page. This class should contain:\n        *   Locators for the key UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n        *   Methods to verify the presence of these elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be present) to handle potential loading delays.  A timeout of 5-10 seconds should be sufficient.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial website load in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`/`):** This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n    2.  **UI Element Presence:**\n        *   Login button/link: Element is present and visible.\n        *   Signup/GetStarted button/link: Element is present and visible.\n        *   Try for Free button/link: Element is present and visible.\n        *   Two additional buttons/links: Elements are present and visible.\n        *   Two menu bars: Elements are present and visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing `app-measurement.com`. It focuses on verifying the basic health of the landing page and ensures that critical UI elements are present and accessible. This strategy will be used to determine if a build is stable enough for further testing."
