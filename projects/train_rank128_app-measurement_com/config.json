  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Smoke Testing for app-measurement.com\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the application available at `https://app-measurement.com`. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The application's domain is classified as `general_web`. While the specific business purpose is not explicitly defined, the presence of \"Login,\" \"Signup,\" and \"Try for Free\" suggests a service-oriented web application, potentially involving user accounts, data management, or analytics.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionality (e.g., website launch, access to login/signup) can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of potential users:** Inability to access the application prevents new user acquisition.\n    *   **Reputational damage:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the organization.\n    *   **Lost business opportunities:** If the application is revenue-generating, downtime directly impacts the bottom line.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website accessibility and successful loading.\n        *   Presence and visibility of key UI elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar) buttons (at least 5).\n        *   Presence and visibility of at least 2 links.\n        *   Presence and visibility of at least 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons and links (no clicking or navigation).\n        *   Form validation.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially, focus on desktop).\n        *   API testing.\n        *   Database testing.\n        *   Detailed UI/UX verification (e.g., precise color matching, font sizes).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the application's basic health and accessibility.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Navigate to `https://app-measurement.com` and verify the page loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button (or similar).\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar button.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" button (or similar).\n        5.  **Button Presence (Additional 2):** Verify the presence of two more buttons (any buttons on the page).\n        6.  **Link Presence (2):** Verify the presence of at least two links on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Verify the presence of at least two menu bars on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for Smoke Testing, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   **Objective:** Ensure that changes do not break existing functionality.\n    *   **Strategy:**  Once smoke tests are stable, a regression suite will be developed to cover:\n        *   Functionality of all buttons and links (navigation, form submission).\n        *   Form validation (positive and negative cases).\n        *   Error handling (invalid inputs, server errors).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility.\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   API testing (as applicable).\n        *   Database testing (as applicable).\n        *   UI/UX verification.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For the smoke tests, no specific test data is required as we are only verifying the presence of UI elements.\n    *   For future regression tests, a combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used. Static data will be used for core scenarios, while dynamic data will be used for boundary testing and negative scenarios.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   **Technology Stack:** Recommend using a robust and widely adopted technology stack such as:\n        *   **Language:** Python or JavaScript (depending on team expertise)\n        *   **Testing Framework:** Pytest (Python) or Jest/Mocha (JavaScript)\n        *   **Browser Automation:** Selenium WebDriver or Playwright\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_until` or `retry` mechanisms) to handle potential timing issues and ensure elements are fully loaded before assertions are made.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met (e.g., element to be visible, clickable) before interacting with elements.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future):** Explore self-healing capabilities using AI-powered tools to automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`/`):** The primary focus for identifying buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the main page content (e.g., a heading or logo).\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present in the DOM and are visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS).\n    *   **Text Verification (Optional):** If possible, verify the text content of the buttons (e.g., \"Login,\" \"Signup\") to ensure they are correctly labeled.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing `https://app-measurement.com`. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the application's core functionality is validated effectively and efficiently."
