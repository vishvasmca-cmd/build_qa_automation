My mandate is to create a comprehensive Master Test Strategy for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing with a specific user goal of logging in and adding the first product to the cart. Here's the breakdown:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://www.saucedemo.com/\n**Business Domain:** General E-commerce (Demo)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo.com is a demo e-commerce application. While not a real-world business, it simulates typical e-commerce functionality. Key areas include:\n\n*   **Login:** User authentication and access control.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying and filtering products.\n*   **Product Details:** Viewing individual product information.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and managing items.\n*   **Checkout:** Completing the purchase process (simulated).\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nEven though it's a demo site, failures can impact the perception of the underlying testing framework and automation.\n\n*   **Functional Failures:** Incorrect product prices, inability to add items to the cart, broken checkout flow.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** While less critical, vulnerabilities like XSS or SQL injection (if present) should be identified.\n*   **Performance Issues:** Slow page load times or unresponsive elements.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user login, product browsing, adding products to the cart, and the initial stages of the checkout process (up to the information page).\n*   Positive and negative test scenarios for all in-scope functionalities.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).\n*   Basic security testing (input validation, XSS, SQLi).\n*   Accessibility testing (basic checks for ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Payment gateway integration (as it's a demo).\n*   Shipping calculations (as it's a demo).\n*   Advanced performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Detailed accessibility compliance (WCAG).\n*   API testing (unless specifically required for core functionality).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n    *   Verify product catalog page loads successfully.\n    *   Verify a single product can be added to the cart.\n*   **Environment:** Staging environment.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect username/password).\n    *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart.\n    *   Entering invalid data in checkout forms (e.g., incorrect zip code).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Adding a large quantity of items to the cart.\n    *   Simultaneous user access (basic concurrency).\n    *   Handling network interruptions during checkout.\n    *   Empty cart scenarios.\n*   **Security Testing:**\n    *   Input validation for all form fields to prevent XSS attacks.\n    *   Parameter tampering checks.\n    *   SQL injection attempts (if applicable).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:** Predefined user credentials (valid and invalid), product IDs.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Randomly generated names, addresses, and other information for checkout forms.  Faker library is recommended.\n    *   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a separate configuration file or database.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should have a corresponding Page Object class that encapsulates the elements and actions on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable, rather than relying on fixed timeouts.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed test steps, especially for actions that are prone to intermittent failures (e.g., clicking buttons, loading pages).\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically identify and correct broken locators.  This could involve using AI-powered tools or custom scripts.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Prioritized Exploration)\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  Focus on different login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials, locked-out user).\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:** Explore product filtering, sorting, and pagination.\n3.  **Product Details Page:**  Verify product information and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n4.  **Shopping Cart Page:**  Test adding, removing, and updating quantities of items.\n5.  **Checkout: Your Information Page:**  Focus on input validation and error handling for the checkout form.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Criteria:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected elements are visible on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product name on the product details page).\n    *   Form submissions are successful (e.g., user is redirected to the next page in the checkout flow).\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n*   **Failure Criteria:**\n    *   HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).\n    *   Unexpected exceptions or errors.\n    *   Incorrect data displayed on the page.\n    *   Broken links or images.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities detected.\n\n```\n"
