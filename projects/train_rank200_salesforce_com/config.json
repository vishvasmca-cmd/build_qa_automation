  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Salesforce.com - Initial Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the initial smoke testing phase of Salesforce.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Salesforce.com is a critical business application (CRM) used by numerous organizations. Failure can lead to significant business disruption, data loss, and reputational damage.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. System failures can result in:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Inability to manage sales pipelines, lost revenue opportunities.\n    *   **Data Breach:** Compromised customer data, legal ramifications.\n    *   **Trust Loss:** Damage to Salesforce's reputation, customer churn.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence (not functionality).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Login process.\n        *   Signup/GetStarted process.\n        *   Data validation.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis is a smoke test, designed to quickly verify the basic health of the application.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Salesforce.com homepage loads successfully.\n    2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n        *   \"Login\" button/link.\n        *   \"Signup/GetStarted\" button/link (or equivalent).\n        *   \"Try for Free\" button/link (or equivalent).\n        *   5 additional buttons (any on the homepage).\n        *   2 links (any on the homepage).\n        *   2 menu bars (navigation menus).\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this initial smoke test. Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data interaction.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for future test automation. For this initial smoke test, a simple script is sufficient, but the POM structure should be considered for scalability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for element to be present) to handle potential loading delays. A timeout of 5-10 seconds should be sufficient.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Not required for this initial smoke test.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Salesforce.com Homepage:** The primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code AND the presence of the `<html>` tag.\n    *   **Element Identification:** The specified elements are present on the page (visible and interactable). This can be verified by checking the element's `isDisplayed()` and `isEnabled()` properties.\n*   **Success Criteria:** All verification criteria must pass for the smoke test to be considered successful. If any criteria fail, the build should be rejected."
