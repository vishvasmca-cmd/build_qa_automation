  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Salesforce.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nSalesforce.com is a leading CRM platform. Its availability and core functionality are critical for its customers' business operations. Failure can lead to significant business disruption, data loss, and reputational damage.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n*   **High:** System unavailability or failure of core features (login, navigation) directly impacts customer access and business operations.\n*   **Data Security:** While this smoke test doesn't focus on data manipulation, any vulnerability exposed during initial access points is a high-risk concern.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Public-facing website issues can erode trust and impact brand perception.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Website launch and accessibility.\n    *   Identification of key UI elements: Login button, Signup/Get Started button, \"Try for Free\" button, and any other 2 prominent buttons.\n    *   Identification of 2 prominent links on the homepage.\n    *   Identification of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page (no interaction required).\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Login functionality (credentials, authentication).\n    *   Signup/Get Started process.\n    *   \"Try for Free\" process.\n    *   Any interaction with the identified buttons, links, or menu bars.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing beyond basic availability.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n    *   Mobile testing.\n    *   Error handling.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThis suite provides a rapid health check to ensure the Salesforce.com website is operational and key elements are present.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Salesforce.com homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n    3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n    4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button (or similar call to action) is present and visible on the homepage.\n    5.  **Button 4 & 5 Presence:** Verify the presence of two additional prominent buttons on the homepage.\n    6.  **Link 1 & 2 Presence:** Verify the presence of two prominent links on the homepage.\n    7.  **Menu Bar 1 & 2 Presence:** Verify the presence of two menu bars on the homepage.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No test data is required for this smoke test, as it only verifies the presence of UI elements.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*   **Not Applicable:** This document focuses solely on the Smoke Test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Salesforce.com homepage. This will encapsulate the locators and interactions with the UI elements.\n\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains locators for the Login button, Signup button, Try for Free button, links, and menu bars.\n        *   Methods: `isLoginButtonPresent()`, `isSignupButtonPresent()`, `isTryForFreeButtonPresent()`, `isLink1Present()`, `isLink2Present()`, `isMenuBar1Present()`, `isMenuBar2Present()`.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when verifying the presence of elements. This allows the test to wait for the element to become visible before failing.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire smoke test suite. If the suite fails due to transient network issues or temporary server unavailability, retry the entire suite a maximum of 2 times.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\n*   **Primary Target:** Salesforce.com Homepage (`https://salesforce.com`).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Website Launch:**\n    *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n*   **Button/Link/Menu Bar Presence:**\n    *   Element is present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n    *   Element is visible on the page (e.g., using `element.isDisplayed()` in Selenium).\n    *   Element's text (if applicable) matches expected values (e.g., \"Login\", \"Sign Up\").\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing the Salesforce.com smoke test. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on verifying the core functionality and availability of the website. This document will be updated as needed to reflect changes in the application or testing requirements."
