  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Salesforce.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Salesforce.com smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** Salesforce.com is a critical CRM platform. Failure can lead to significant business disruption, data loss, and reputational damage.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** High. System unavailability directly impacts sales, customer service, and overall business operations. Data integrity is paramount.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements on the homepage: Login button, Signup/Get Started button, Try for Free button, and any other 2 prominent buttons.\n        *   Presence of 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons and links (clicking, navigation).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation (colors, fonts, responsiveness).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Testing beyond the homepage.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the Salesforce.com website is accessible and the core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Salesforce.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Button Presence:** Verify the presence of \"Login\", \"Signup/Get Started\", \"Try for Free\" buttons, and any other 2 prominent buttons on the homepage.\n        3.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of 2 links on the homepage.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability and scalability. Create a `HomePage` object containing locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential delays in element loading. This reduces flakiness caused by network latency.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to be present and visible before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage:** `https://salesforce.com`\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200. Page title contains \"Salesforce\".\n    *   **Button Presence:** The specified buttons are present and visible on the page.\n    *   **Link Presence:** The specified links are present and visible on the page.\n    *   **Menu Bar Presence:** The specified menu bars are present and visible on the page.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test results.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed tests.\n    *   Screenshots of failed tests.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing the Salesforce.com smoke test. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the stability and reliability of the application."
