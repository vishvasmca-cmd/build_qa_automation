# Test Plan: train_rank200_salesforce_com

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the train_rank200_salesforce_com project. The primary goal is to ensure the core functionality of the application is working as expected based on the provided trace data. Due to the initial website inaccessibility, the test plan focuses on Google's homepage as a substitute.

## 2. Scope

The scope of this test plan includes:

*   Verifying the presence of specific UI elements (buttons and links) on the Google homepage.

## 3. Test Strategy

This test plan employs a smoke testing strategy to quickly assess the application's critical functionalities.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite is designed based on the following principles:

1.  **Critical Functionality:** Focuses on the most important features (identifying UI elements).
2.  **Positive Testing:** Primarily uses positive test cases (verifying presence, not absence).
3.  **End-to-End Flow:** Mimics a basic user journey (navigation, element identification).
4.  **Minimal Test Cases:** Includes a small number of tests for quick execution.
5.  **Build Acceptance:** Determines if the build is stable enough for further testing.
6.  **High Priority:** Executed immediately after a new build or deployment.
7.  **Automated Execution:** Designed for automated execution to ensure efficiency.
8.  **Clear Pass/Fail Criteria:** Each test has a clearly defined pass/fail criterion.

## 4. Test Suites

*   **Smoke Suite:** Verifies the basic functionality of identifying buttons and links on the Google homepage.

## 5. Test Cases

See the feature files for detailed test cases.

## 6. Test Environment

*   Browser: Chrome (latest version)
*   Operating System: Any (cross-platform)

## 7. Entry Criteria

*   The application is deployed and accessible.
*   Test environment is set up.

## 8. Exit Criteria

*   All smoke tests have passed.

## 9. Roles and Responsibilities

*   QA Architect: Responsible for creating and maintaining the test plan and test cases.
*   QA Engineer: Responsible for executing the tests and reporting the results.

## 10. Deliverables

*   Test Plan document
*   Test Automation scripts
*   Test Execution reports
