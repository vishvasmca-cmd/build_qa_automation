  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke). This document is designed to guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** AutomationExercise.com (E-commerce)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n**Focus:** Critical User Journey - Product Search and Checkout\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nAutomationExercise.com is an E-commerce platform. The core business functionality revolves around users being able to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete the checkout process. Any failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and user satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nA failure in the core product search and checkout flow can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders results in immediate revenue loss.\n*   **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Frustrated users may abandon the platform and switch to competitors.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative experiences can lead to negative reviews and loss of trust.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Navigation to the Products page.\n    *   Product search functionality.\n    *   Adding products to the shopping cart.\n    *   Viewing the shopping cart.\n    *   Proceeding to the checkout process.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   User registration and login.\n    *   Detailed product page features (reviews, related products, etc.).\n    *   Payment gateway integration (simulated payment is acceptable for smoke).\n    *   Order history and account management.\n    *   All negative testing scenarios (invalid search terms, out-of-stock items, etc.).\n    *   Mobile responsiveness.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will consist of a minimal set of tests to verify the core functionality is operational. If any of these tests fail, the build is considered unstable and should be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Product Search and Add to Cart**\n    1.  Navigate to the homepage (`https://automationexercise.com/`).\n    2.  Navigate to the Products page.\n    3.  Search for \"Dress\".\n    4.  Add the first displayed \"Dress\" product to the cart.\n    5.  Verify the product is added to the cart (e.g., a success message or cart icon update).\n*   **Test Case 2: Checkout Process**\n    1.  Navigate to the Cart page.\n    2.  Proceed to Checkout.\n    3.  Fill in the required billing/shipping information (using pre-defined test data).\n    4.  Place the order (using a simulated payment method).\n    5.  Verify the order confirmation page is displayed.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Future Expansion)\n\n*   **Note:** While this is a *smoke* test strategy, it's important to consider how the test suite will expand into a full regression suite.  The following are examples of tests that would be included in a regression suite, but are *excluded* from the smoke tests.\n*   **Alternative Flows:**\n    *   Searching for different product categories.\n    *   Using different payment methods.\n*   **Negative Scenarios:**\n    *   Searching for invalid product names.\n    *   Attempting to checkout with an empty cart.\n*   **Boundary Analysis:**\n    *   Adding multiple quantities of the same product.\n*   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n    *   Verifying that the cart total is updated correctly after adding/removing items.\n*   **Validation Messages:**\n    *   Verifying that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input during checkout.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Smoke Tests:** Use static, pre-defined test data for billing/shipping information. This data should be simple and consistent.\n*   **Regression Tests (Future):** Consider using a combination of static and dynamically generated data to cover a wider range of scenarios.  For example, using a library to generate random addresses.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Example: `HomePage.java`, `ProductsPage.java`, `CartPage.java`, `CheckoutPage.java`.\n*   **Test Runner:** Use a test runner like JUnit or TestNG to manage and execute the tests.\n*   **Assertion Library:** Use an assertion library like AssertJ or Hamcrest for more readable and expressive assertions.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Awaitility) to wait for elements to become visible or for conditions to be met. This helps to mitigate timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific elements to be present or interactable before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for tests that are known to be flaky.\n*   **Self-Healing (Advanced):**\n    *   Consider implementing a self-healing mechanism that can automatically identify and correct broken locators. This can be achieved using AI-powered tools or custom logic.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Initial Focus)\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify basic page load and navigation links.\n2.  **Products Page:** Verify product listing and search functionality.\n3.  **Cart Page:** Verify adding/removing items and updating quantities.\n4.  **Checkout Page:** Verify the checkout process and order placement.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected elements are visible on each page (e.g., product listings, cart summary, checkout form).\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n    *   The order confirmation page is displayed after placing the order.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).\n    *   Missing or incorrect elements on the page.\n    *   JavaScript errors.\n    *   Unexpected redirects.\n    *   Exceptions during test execution.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust and reliable test suite for AutomationExercise.com. It is important to continuously review and update this strategy as the application evolves."
