  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke). This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://automationexercise.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nAutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business functionality revolves around product discovery, purchasing, and order fulfillment.  A failure in any of these areas directly impacts revenue generation and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Failure to process orders correctly or display accurate product information leads to lost sales and potential refunds.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** A broken checkout process or inability to find products frustrates users and damages the brand's reputation.\n*   **Data Integrity:** Incorrect product data (price, description, availability) leads to customer dissatisfaction and potential legal issues.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope (For this Smoke Test):**\n\n*   Navigation to the Products page.\n*   Product search functionality.\n*   Adding a product to the shopping cart.\n*   Navigating to the checkout page.\n\n**Out of Scope (For this Smoke Test):**\n\n*   User registration and login.\n*   Payment processing (simulated or stubbed).\n*   Shipping calculations.\n*   Order confirmation.\n*   Account management.\n*   All negative testing scenarios.\n*   All edge cases.\n*   Mobile testing.\n*   Accessibility testing.\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will consist of a single, critical path test case designed to verify the core functionality related to the specified user goal.\n\n**Test Case: Verify Product Search and Checkout Navigation**\n\n1.  **Navigate to Products Page:** Open the AutomationExercise.com homepage and navigate to the \"Products\" page.\n2.  **Search for Product:** Enter \"Dress\" in the search bar and initiate the search.\n3.  **Add to Cart:** Select the first product displayed in the search results and add it to the shopping cart.\n4.  **Navigate to Checkout:** Proceed to the checkout page from the shopping cart.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*Not applicable for this Smoke Test Strategy.* A full regression suite would be defined later, encompassing variations and edge cases.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** For this smoke test, we will use static data. The search term \"Dress\" is pre-defined.\n*   **Product Selection:** The test will always select the *first* product returned in the search results. This assumes a product will always be returned for the search term \"Dress\".\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n\n    *   Example Page Objects: `HomePage`, `ProductsPage`, `ShoppingCartPage`, `CheckoutPage`.\n    *   Each Page Object should contain:\n        *   Locators for elements on the page (e.g., search bar, add to cart button, checkout button).\n        *   Methods to interact with the elements (e.g., `enterSearchTerm()`, `clickAddToCart()`, `clickCheckout()`).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable. This helps mitigate timing issues and flakiness.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for critical actions (e.g., clicking a button) that may occasionally fail due to transient issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent (if used later for regression) should prioritize exploring these pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Products Page:** Focus on search functionality and product listing.\n2.  **Product Detail Page:** Focus on adding to cart functionality.\n3.  **Shopping Cart Page:** Focus on navigation to checkout.\n4.  **Checkout Page:** Focus on the initial page load and element presence.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n*   **Element Presence:** Verify that key elements are present on each page:\n    *   Products Page: Search bar, product listings.\n    *   Product Detail Page: Add to cart button.\n    *   Shopping Cart Page: Checkout button.\n    *   Checkout Page: Address fields, payment options (even if stubbed).\n*   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text is visible on each page (e.g., \"Products\" heading on the Products page, \"Shopping Cart\" heading on the Shopping Cart page).\n\n**Success Definition:** The smoke test is considered successful if all verification criteria are met for each step of the test case. A failure in any step indicates a critical issue that requires immediate attention."
