  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke). This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://automationexercise.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nAutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business functionality revolves around product discovery, shopping cart management, and checkout. Any failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction. Given the focus on a specific user flow (product search, add to cart, checkout), the risk is primarily related to the inability of users to complete a purchase.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders results in direct revenue loss.\n*   **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Frustration due to broken functionality leads to negative reviews and churn.\n*   **Brand Reputation:** Public perception of the platform's reliability is damaged.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Navigation to the Products page.\n    *   Searching for a specific product (\"Dress\").\n    *   Adding the product to the shopping cart.\n    *   Proceeding to the checkout process.\n    *   Verifying the product is in the cart.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Detailed product page testing (reviews, specifications, etc.).\n    *   Payment gateway integration.\n    *   User account creation/login.\n    *   Order history.\n    *   All other functionalities not directly related to the specified user goal.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will consist of a single, end-to-end test case designed to validate the core functionality of the specified user flow.\n\n*   **Test Case:** \"Verify User Can Add 'Dress' to Cart and Proceed to Checkout\"\n    1.  Navigate to `https://automationexercise.com/products`.\n    2.  Search for \"Dress\" in the product search bar.\n    3.  Select the first dress from the search results.\n    4.  Add the dress to the cart.\n    5.  Navigate to the cart page.\n    6.  Proceed to checkout.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*   **Not Applicable:** For this initial \"Smoke\" strategy, a full regression suite is not defined. Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** For the smoke test, we will use static data. The search term \"Dress\" is hardcoded into the test.\n*   **Future Considerations:** For regression testing, consider using dynamic data generation or a dedicated test data management system to handle variations in product names, quantities, etc.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve maintainability and reduce code duplication.\n    *   **Page Objects:**\n        *   `HomePage`: Represents the main landing page.\n        *   `ProductsPage`: Represents the products listing page.\n        *   `CartPage`: Represents the shopping cart page.\n        *   `CheckoutPage`: Represents the checkout page.\n    *   **Elements:** Each page object should encapsulate the locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPaths) for the elements on that page.\n    *   **Methods:** Each page object should provide methods for interacting with the elements on that page (e.g., `searchForProduct(productName)`, `addToCart()`, `proceedToCheckout()`).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable. This helps mitigate timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for critical actions (e.g., adding to cart) in case of intermittent failures.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques where the framework automatically attempts to locate elements using alternative locators if the primary locator fails.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent (if applicable) should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Products Page (`/products`):** Focus on the search functionality and product listing.\n2.  **Cart Page (`/view_cart`):** Focus on adding products, updating quantities, and proceeding to checkout.\n3.  **Checkout Page (`/checkout`):** Focus on address input and order confirmation.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   The search results page displays products matching the search term \"Dress\".\n    *   The cart page displays the added \"Dress\" product.\n    *   The checkout page loads successfully.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).\n    *   Elements not found (e.g., search bar, add to cart button).\n    *   Incorrect product displayed in the cart.\n    *   Checkout page fails to load.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the engineering team to implement a robust smoke test for AutomationExercise.com. It emphasizes risk assessment, a well-defined testing scope, architectural guidance, and clear execution instructions. This document will be updated as the application evolves and the testing strategy matures."
