  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke). This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** AI Test Strategist\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nAutomationExercise.com operates within the E-commerce domain.  The core business function is enabling users to browse, select, and purchase products.  Therefore, any failure in the core purchase flow (product browsing, adding to cart, checkout) directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nA failure in the specified user goal (Navigate to Products, search for 'Dress', add to cart, and go to checkout) carries the following risks:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to complete purchases directly translates to lost revenue.\n*   **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Frustrated users may abandon the site and choose competitors.\n*   **Brand Damage:** Repeated failures erode customer trust and negatively impact brand reputation.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope (For this Smoke Test):**\n\n*   Navigation to the Products page.\n*   Search functionality for a specific product (\"Dress\").\n*   Adding the searched product to the shopping cart.\n*   Navigation to the checkout page from the cart.\n\n**Out of Scope (For this Smoke Test):**\n\n*   User registration and login.\n*   Detailed product page functionality (reviews, related products, etc.).\n*   Payment processing.\n*   Shipping address input.\n*   Coupon code application.\n*   Order confirmation.\n*   All negative testing scenarios (e.g., invalid search terms, out-of-stock items).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n*   Mobile testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will consist of a single, end-to-end test case covering the defined user goal.  This test must pass for every build to be considered deployable.\n\n**Test Case: Core Purchase Flow - Dress**\n\n1.  Navigate to `https://automationexercise.com/`.\n2.  Navigate to the \"Products\" page.\n3.  Search for \"Dress\".\n4.  Add the first displayed \"Dress\" product to the cart.\n5.  Navigate to the \"Cart\" page.\n6.  Proceed to the \"Checkout\" page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*   **Not applicable for this initial Smoke Test strategy.** Regression testing will be defined in a separate, more comprehensive test strategy document. However, the architecture guidance below should consider future regression needs.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** For this smoke test, we will use a static search term (\"Dress\").  No dynamic data generation is required.\n*   **Future Consideration:** For regression testing, consider using a product catalog API (if available) to dynamically retrieve product names for search and add-to-cart operations. This will make the tests more resilient to changes in the product catalog.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class.  Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n\n    *   Example Page Objects:\n        *   `HomePage`\n        *   `ProductsPage`\n        *   `CartPage`\n        *   `CheckoutPage`\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous loading of elements.  This prevents tests from failing due to timing issues.  Instead of immediately asserting that an element is present, poll for its presence for a reasonable amount of time (e.g., 5-10 seconds).\n*   **Explicit Waits:**  Use explicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.  Avoid implicit waits, as they can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails due to a transient issue (e.g., network glitch), retry the test a limited number of times (e.g., 2-3 times) before marking it as a failure.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and log informative error messages. This will help in diagnosing and resolving test failures.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent (if used) should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify basic page load and navigation links.\n2.  **Products Page:** Focus on search functionality and product listing.\n3.  **Cart Page:** Verify adding products and navigation to checkout.\n4.  **Checkout Page:** Ensure the checkout page loads correctly.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   All steps in the \"Core Purchase Flow - Dress\" test case execute without errors.\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant elements are visible on each page (e.g., search bar on the Products page, product name in the Cart).\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   Any step in the test case fails.\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n    *   Unexpected redirects or page content.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a reliable smoke test suite for AutomationExercise.com.  It emphasizes a risk-based approach, clear scope definition, and robust architecture to ensure the quality and stability of the application. Remember that this is a living document and should be updated as the application evolves and testing needs change."
