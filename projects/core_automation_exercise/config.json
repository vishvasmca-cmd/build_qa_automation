  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team and ensure a robust and efficient testing process.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** AutomationExercise.com (E-commerce)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nAutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. In this domain, the core business functions revolve around product discovery, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process. Any failures in these areas directly impact revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nGiven the e-commerce nature, the following risks are prioritized:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Failure in the checkout process leading to lost sales.\n*   **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Inability to add products to the cart or complete a purchase.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Broken core functionality leading to negative user experiences.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope (Smoke):**\n\n*   Navigation to the Products page.\n*   Searching for a specific product (\"Dress\").\n*   Adding the searched product to the cart.\n*   Navigating to the checkout page.\n\n**Out of Scope (For Smoke - will be covered in Regression):**\n\n*   Detailed product page testing (reviews, descriptions, etc.).\n*   Filtering and sorting of products.\n*   Payment gateway integration.\n*   User account creation/login.\n*   Coupon code application.\n*   Shipping calculations.\n*   Negative testing (e.g., invalid search terms, out-of-stock items).\n*   Responsive testing (mobile/tablet).\n*   Accessibility testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be the \"health check\" for each build. If any of these tests fail, the build is considered unstable and should be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Product Search and Add to Cart**\n    1.  Navigate to the homepage (https://automationexercise.com/).\n    2.  Navigate to the Products page.\n    3.  Search for \"Dress\".\n    4.  Add the first displayed \"Dress\" product to the cart.\n    5.  Navigate to the Cart page.\n    6.  Proceed to Checkout.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Future - High Level)\n\n*   **Product Catalog:** Comprehensive testing of product browsing, filtering, sorting, and detailed product information.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Testing adding, removing, updating quantities, and handling out-of-stock scenarios.\n*   **Checkout & Payments:** Testing various payment methods, address validation, coupon codes, and order confirmation.\n*   **User Accounts:** Registration, login, profile management, and password reset flows.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nFor the Smoke tests, we will use:\n\n*   **Static Data:** The search term \"Dress\" will be hardcoded. This ensures consistency and avoids dependency on dynamic data.\n*   **Future Regression:** Dynamic data generation will be explored for regression tests to cover a wider range of scenarios (e.g., different product names, quantities, addresses).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and readability. Each page (e.g., HomePage, ProductsPage, CartPage, CheckoutPage) should have its own Page Object class.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions (e.g., using WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous loading of elements. This will reduce flakiness due to timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests (e.g., using a TestNG listener or a custom decorator). This can help mitigate intermittent failures due to network issues or environment instability.\n*   **Self-Healing (Future):** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI-powered element locators) to automatically adapt to UI changes.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (For Autonomous Exploration - Future)\n\nFor future autonomous exploration and test case generation, prioritize these pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Products Page:** Focus on exploring different filters, sorting options, and product categories.\n2.  **Cart Page:** Explore different quantity updates, removing items, and applying coupon codes.\n3.  **Checkout Page:** Explore different address formats, payment methods, and shipping options.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **General Success:** The test passes if all steps are executed without exceptions and all assertions are met.\n*   **Specific Criteria:**\n    *   **Navigation to Products Page:** Verify that the Products page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code) and the page title contains \"Products\".\n    *   **Search for \"Dress\":** Verify that the search results page loads successfully and displays products related to \"Dress\".\n    *   **Add to Cart:** Verify that the product is successfully added to the cart (e.g., a success message is displayed, the cart icon updates with the correct quantity).\n    *   **Navigate to Checkout:** Verify that the Checkout page loads successfully and displays the cart summary and checkout form.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the critical user goal and ensuring a high level of quality and stability. This document will be updated as the application evolves and new features are added."
