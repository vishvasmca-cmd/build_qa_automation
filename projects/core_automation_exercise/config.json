  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke). This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team and ensure a robust and efficient testing process.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** AutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business functionality revolves around product browsing, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process. Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failures can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative customer experience due to broken functionality.\n    *   **Lost Sales:** Customers abandoning purchases due to errors.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Navigation to the Products page.\n        *   Product search functionality.\n        *   Adding products to the cart.\n        *   Initiating the checkout process.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   User registration/login.\n        *   Payment processing (simulated payment is acceptable).\n        *   Detailed product page elements (reviews, descriptions).\n        *   Order history.\n        *   Account management.\n        *   All negative testing.\n        *   Responsiveness testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing.\n        *   Performance testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a Smoke Test, designed to quickly verify the core functionality of the application.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the fundamental \"happy path\" of product discovery and checkout initiation.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Navigate to Products Page:** Verify the Products page loads successfully.\n        2.  **Search for \"Dress\":** Verify search functionality returns relevant results.\n        3.  **Add First Dress to Cart:** Verify the first dress in the search results can be added to the cart.\n        4.  **Proceed to Checkout:** Verify the user can navigate to the checkout page from the cart.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this Smoke Test strategy, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   **Objective:** Ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases:** (Examples - NOT EXECUTED IN SMOKE TEST)\n        1.  Add multiple items to the cart.\n        2.  Update quantities in the cart.\n        3.  Remove items from the cart.\n        4.  Apply coupon codes.\n        5.  Different shipping addresses.\n        6.  Simulate payment failures.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** For the Smoke Test, we can use static data (e.g., searching for the term \"Dress\").\n    *   **Dynamic Data (Future):** For Regression Tests, consider using dynamic data generation (e.g., generating random product names or email addresses) to increase test coverage and reduce data dependencies.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and readability. Each page (e.g., Products Page, Cart Page, Checkout Page) should have its own Page Object class.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:** E-commerce sites often have dynamic content and asynchronous loading.\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id(\"cart-total\")))`) to wait for elements to load before interacting with them.\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to avoid unnecessary delays and improve test reliability.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed test steps (e.g., retrying adding an item to the cart if it fails the first time).\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Consider implementing a self-healing mechanism that can automatically locate elements even if their locators change slightly. This can be achieved using AI-powered tools or custom logic.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Verify the Products link is present and functional.\n    2.  **Products Page:** Verify the search bar is present and functional.\n    3.  **Search Results Page:** Verify product listings are displayed correctly.\n    4.  **Cart Page:** Verify items are added to the cart correctly.\n    5.  **Checkout Page:** Verify the checkout page loads successfully.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify all pages return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify key elements are visible on each page (e.g., search bar on the Products page, product name and price on the Search Results page, item name and quantity on the Cart page).\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify specific text is present on each page (e.g., \"Products\" heading on the Products page, \"Checkout\" heading on the Checkout page).\n    *   **Cart Count:** Verify the cart count updates correctly when an item is added to the cart.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate a clear and concise test report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots or videos of failed test cases to aid in debugging.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing AutomationExercise.com. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and new features are added. Good luck!"
