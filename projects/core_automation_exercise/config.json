  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for automationexercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke).\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://automationexercise.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** This is a standard e-commerce platform. The core business functionality revolves around product browsing, adding to cart, and checkout.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure in these core areas directly translates to lost revenue and a negative customer experience. A failed checkout is a P0 (Priority 0) issue.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Navigation to the Products page.\n        *   Product search functionality.\n        *   Adding products to the shopping cart.\n        *   Navigating to the checkout page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   User registration/login.\n        *   Detailed product page testing (reviews, related products, etc.).\n        *   Payment processing (simulated success is sufficient for smoke).\n        *   Order history.\n        *   Account management.\n        *   All other pages/flows not directly related to the specified user goal.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the core \"happy path\" of product discovery and checkout initiation.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Navigate to Products Page:** Verify the Products page loads successfully.\n        2.  **Search for \"Dress\":** Verify search functionality returns relevant results.\n        3.  **Add \"Dress\" to Cart:** Verify a dress product can be added to the cart.\n        4.  **Navigate to Checkout:** Verify the user can successfully navigate to the checkout page.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deferred):** A full regression suite will be defined *after* the smoke tests are stable. This will include:\n    *   Alternative search terms.\n    *   Variations in product selection.\n    *   Cart manipulation (quantity changes, removals).\n    *   Checkout process variations (guest checkout, different shipping options).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For smoke tests, static test data is sufficient. A pre-defined \"Dress\" product should be used for consistency.\n    *   For regression tests, a more dynamic approach will be needed, potentially involving data generation or access to a test database.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** This is a must. Each page (e.g., Products Page, Cart Page, Checkout Page) should be represented by a Page Object.\n    *   **Centralized Element Repository:** Store all element locators in a central location (e.g., a properties file or a dedicated class) to improve maintainability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous loading and dynamic content.  Instead of immediately failing if an element isn't present, the test should wait for a short period and retry.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a limited number of times before marking it as a failure.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future Consideration):** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI to automatically update locators) as the test suite matures.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **/products:** The main Products page.\n    2.  **/products?search=Dress:** The search results page for \"Dress\".\n    3.  **/view_cart:** The shopping cart page.\n    4.  **/checkout:** The checkout page.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** All pages must return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Page Title:** Verify the page title is correct (e.g., \"Automation Exercise - All Products\").\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Key elements on each page must be visible (e.g., the search results, the \"Add to Cart\" button, the cart summary).\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify specific text elements are present (e.g., \"Shopping Cart\", \"Checkout\").\n    *   **Cart Count:** After adding a product to the cart, verify the cart count is updated correctly.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for automating the smoke tests for AutomationExercise.com. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical functionality and ensuring the test suite is resilient and maintainable."
