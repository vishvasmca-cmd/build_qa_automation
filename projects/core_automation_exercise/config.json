  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for automationexercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document is designed to guide the engineering team in building a robust and effective test automation framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Automationexercise.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** automationexercise.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n*   **Business Criticality:** E-commerce platforms are highly business-critical. Revenue generation, customer satisfaction, and brand reputation are directly tied to the platform's stability and functionality.\n*   **Critical Flows:** Product browsing, search, adding to cart, and checkout are core revenue-generating flows.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n*   **Financial Loss:** Failures in checkout or payment processing directly lead to lost revenue.\n*   **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Bugs in product browsing or cart functionality can frustrate users and lead to cart abandonment.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** A consistently buggy or unreliable platform damages brand reputation and erodes customer trust.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n*   **In Scope (Smoke):**\n    *   Navigation to the Products page.\n    *   Search functionality for a specific product (\"Dress\").\n    *   Adding the searched product to the shopping cart.\n    *   Navigating to the checkout page.\n*   **Out of Scope (For Smoke):**\n    *   User registration and login.\n    *   Payment processing (simulated or stubbed for smoke).\n    *   Detailed product attribute validation (beyond basic existence).\n    *   Coupon code application.\n    *   Shipping calculations.\n    *   Order confirmation.\n    *   Negative testing (e.g., searching for non-existent products).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n*   **Definition:** A minimal set of tests to verify the core functionality of product search, adding to cart, and reaching the checkout page.\n*   **Goal:** To quickly assess the health of the application after deployments or code changes.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Navigate to Products Page:** Verify the \"Products\" link is present and navigates to the correct page.\n    2.  **Search for \"Dress\":** Enter \"Dress\" in the search bar and verify that search results are displayed.\n    3.  **Add Dress to Cart:** Select a dress from the search results and add it to the shopping cart.\n    4.  **Navigate to Checkout:** Verify the \"Cart\" link/icon is present and navigates to the checkout page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Future Expansion)\n*   **Note:** While this is a *smoke* test strategy, outlining the regression strategy provides context for future test expansion.\n*   **Definition:** A comprehensive suite of tests to ensure that changes haven't broken existing functionality.\n*   **Goal:** To provide confidence that new features or bug fixes haven't introduced regressions.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   Search for various product types.\n    *   Add multiple items to the cart.\n    *   Update quantities in the cart.\n    *   Remove items from the cart.\n    *   Test different checkout flows (e.g., guest checkout).\n    *   Validate error messages (e.g., out-of-stock).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n*   **Static Data:** For the smoke tests, use static data (e.g., the search term \"Dress\"). This simplifies the tests and reduces dependencies.\n*   **Dynamic Generation (Future):** For regression tests, consider dynamic data generation (e.g., creating unique usernames) to avoid data collisions and improve test coverage.  Faker libraries are recommended.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended.  This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n    *   Create separate page object classes for:\n        *   HomePage\n        *   ProductsPage\n        *   SearchResultsPage\n        *   CartPage\n        *   CheckoutPage\n    *   Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable. This helps to mitigate timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI-powered element locators) to automatically adapt to UI changes.  This is a longer-term goal.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n*   **Priority 1: Products Page:** Focus on the \"Products\" page, search functionality, and product display.\n*   **Priority 2: Cart Page:** Focus on adding items to the cart and viewing the cart summary.\n*   **Priority 3: Checkout Page:** Focus on navigating to the checkout page.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n*   **Success Definition:**\n    *   **HTTP 200 Status:** Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that key elements (e.g., search bar, product images, \"Add to Cart\" button, cart icon) are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text (e.g., \"Products\", \"Shopping Cart\") is present on the page.\n    *   **Navigation:** Verify that clicking on links navigates to the correct pages.\n*   **Failure Definition:**\n    *   HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).\n    *   Missing or incorrect elements.\n    *   Incorrect text.\n    *   Navigation failures.\n    *   Exceptions or errors in the browser console.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust test automation framework for automationexercise.com. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and the testing needs change. Good luck!"
