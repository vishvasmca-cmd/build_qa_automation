  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (smoke). This document is designed to guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** AutomationExercise.com (E-commerce)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nAutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform.  The core business function is selling products online. Therefore, the **Checkout process is considered P0 (Priority Zero)**, meaning any failure in this area has the highest business impact.  Product browsing and cart functionality are also critical.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nSystem failures can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders results in direct revenue loss.\n*   **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Broken functionality leads to a poor user experience and potential loss of customers.\n*   **Brand Damage:**  Frequent errors erode trust in the brand.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope (Smoke):**\n    *   Navigation to the Products page.\n    *   Product Search functionality (basic keyword search).\n    *   Adding a product to the shopping cart.\n    *   Viewing the shopping cart.\n    *   Proceeding to the checkout page.\n*   **Out of Scope (For Smoke - These will be covered in Regression):**\n    *   User registration and login.\n    *   Payment processing (simulated or actual).\n    *   Detailed product filtering and sorting.\n    *   Coupon code application.\n    *   Shipping calculations.\n    *   Order history.\n    *   Account management.\n    *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid search terms, adding out-of-stock items).\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n    *   Mobile testing (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure the core functionality is operational.  A failed smoke test will trigger an immediate investigation and potential build rejection.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Navigate to Products Page:** Verify the \"Products\" link in the navigation bar is present and navigates to the product listing page.\n    2.  **Search for \"Dress\":** Enter \"Dress\" in the search bar and verify that search results are displayed.\n    3.  **Add First Dress to Cart:** Add the first dress displayed in the search results to the cart.\n    4.  **View Cart:** Navigate to the shopping cart and verify that the added dress is present.\n    5.  **Proceed to Checkout:** Click the \"Proceed to Checkout\" button and verify that the checkout page loads.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **N/A**: Regression testing is out of scope for this document.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nFor the Smoke Suite, we will use:\n\n*   **Static Data:**  The search term \"Dress\" is hardcoded.  We assume at least one dress will always be available in the product catalog.\n*   **No User Accounts:** The smoke test focuses on guest checkout.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   Example: `HomePage`, `ProductsPage`, `CartPage`, `CheckoutPage`.\n*   **Language:** [Choose your language: e.g., Java, Python, C#]\n*   **Test Framework:** [Choose your framework: e.g., JUnit, pytest, NUnit]\n*   **Assertion Library:** [Choose your library: e.g., AssertJ, Hamcrest, FluentAssertions]\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., with a retry mechanism) when waiting for elements to load or state to change. This helps mitigate timing issues and flakiness. Example: Wait up to 5 seconds for the cart to update after adding an item.\n*   **Explicit Waits:**  Use explicit waits with expected conditions to ensure elements are present and interactable before attempting to interact with them.  Avoid implicit waits as they can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n*   **Element Identification Strategy:** Prioritize robust element locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `data-qa`) over fragile locators like XPath based on position.  Work with developers to add these attributes if they are missing.\n*   **Screenshot on Failure:** Capture a screenshot on test failure to aid in debugging.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent (if applicable) should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify the presence of the \"Products\" link.\n2.  **Products Page:** Verify the search bar functionality.\n3.  **Product Detail Page (of the first dress):** Verify the \"Add to Cart\" button.\n4.  **Cart Page:** Verify the presence of the added product and the \"Proceed to Checkout\" button.\n5.  **Checkout Page:** Verify the page loads successfully.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   All steps in the Smoke Suite pass without errors.\n    *   HTTP status codes are 200 (OK) for all page requests.\n    *   Key elements are visible on each page (e.g., search bar on Products page, product name on Cart page).\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   Any step in the Smoke Suite fails.\n    *   HTTP status codes are not 200 for critical page requests.\n    *   Key elements are not visible or interactable.\n    *   JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a reliable smoke testing suite for AutomationExercise.com. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and your understanding of the system deepens."
