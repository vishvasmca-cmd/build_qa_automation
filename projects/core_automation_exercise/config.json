  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke).\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the test strategy for a critical smoke test of the AutomationExercise.com e-commerce platform. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding test automation and execution efforts.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: AutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business function is selling products online. Failure in critical areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**:\n    *   **High Risk**: Checkout process failure (loss of revenue, customer frustration).\n    *   **Medium Risk**: Product search and catalog browsing issues (reduced sales, poor user experience).\n    *   **Low Risk**: Minor UI glitches (minimal impact).\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Navigation to the Products page.\n        *   Product search functionality.\n        *   Adding products to the cart.\n        *   Checkout process initiation.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   User registration/login.\n        *   Detailed product page testing (reviews, related products, etc.).\n        *   Payment gateway integration.\n        *   Order history.\n        *   Account management.\n        *   All negative testing (invalid inputs, error handling).\n        *   UI/UX validation (responsive design, cross-browser compatibility).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Goal**: Verify the core functionality required for a user to find a product and begin the checkout process is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Navigate to Products Page**: Verify the \"Products\" link in the header navigates to the product listing page.\n        2.  **Search for \"Dress\"**: Verify the search functionality returns relevant results when searching for \"Dress\".\n        3.  **Add First Dress to Cart**: Add the first product from the search results to the cart.\n        4.  **Proceed to Checkout**: Navigate to the cart and initiate the checkout process.\n*   **Regression Suite (N/A - Smoke Test Focus)**: A full regression suite is out of scope for this document, as we are focusing on the smoke test.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Static Data**: For the smoke test, we can use static data. The search term \"Dress\" is pre-defined.\n    *   **Dynamic Data (Future Consideration)**: For regression testing, consider dynamic data generation or a data seeding strategy to ensure test data variety and avoid conflicts.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Strongly recommended. Create Page Objects for:\n        *   `HomePage`: Header navigation elements.\n        *   `ProductsPage`: Product listing, search functionality.\n        *   `ProductCard`: Individual product elements within the listing.\n        *   `CartPage`: Cart summary, checkout button.\n    *   **Rationale**: POM promotes code reusability, maintainability, and reduces test duplication.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Flakiness Mitigation**:\n        *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntil` or `waitForElementVisible`) to handle asynchronous loading of elements.\n        *   **Explicit Waits**: Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before interaction.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for critical actions (e.g., adding to cart) to handle transient network issues.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future Consideration)**: Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using relative locators) for regression tests to minimize test breakage due to minor UI changes.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Homepage**: Locate the \"Products\" link in the header.\n    2.  **Products Page**: Locate the search input field and search button.\n    3.  **Products Page (Search Results)**: Identify the first product card in the search results.\n    4.  **Product Card**: Locate the \"Add to Cart\" button within the first product card.\n    5.  **Cart Page**: Locate the \"Proceed to Checkout\" button.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Navigation**: Verify that clicking the \"Products\" link navigates to a page with a product listing.\n    *   **Search**: Verify that searching for \"Dress\" returns a page with at least one product displayed.\n    *   **Add to Cart**: Verify that clicking \"Add to Cart\" adds the product to the cart (e.g., a cart count indicator increases).\n    *   **Checkout**: Verify that clicking \"Proceed to Checkout\" navigates to a page that appears to be the beginning of the checkout flow (e.g., displays address form or login options).\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes**: Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility**: Verify that key elements (e.g., search input, product cards, cart button) are visible and interactable.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the smoke test automation of AutomationExercise.com. It emphasizes critical functionality, risk mitigation, and a robust testing architecture. This document should be reviewed and updated as the application evolves."
