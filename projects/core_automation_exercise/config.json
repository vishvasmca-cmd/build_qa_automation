  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for automationexercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke).\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** AutomationExercise.com (E-commerce)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** AutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business functionality revolves around product browsing, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process. Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High Risk:** Checkout process failure (payment processing, order placement).\n    *   **Medium Risk:** Product catalog issues (incorrect pricing, unavailable products).\n    *   **Low Risk:** Minor UI glitches, non-critical content errors.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Navigation to the Products page.\n        *   Product search functionality.\n        *   Adding products to the cart.\n        *   Checkout process (up to payment selection - no actual payment processing).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   User account management (registration, login, profile).\n        *   Payment gateway integration (actual payment processing).\n        *   Order history.\n        *   Detailed product reviews and ratings.\n        *   All admin panel functionalities.\n        *   API testing (except as needed to support UI testing).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic input validation).\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially focus on desktop).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Overall Approach:** This Smoke Test strategy will focus on verifying the core \"happy path\" scenario: a user successfully finds a product, adds it to their cart, and proceeds to the checkout page. This ensures the fundamental e-commerce flow is functional.\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Product Search and Add to Cart**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage (https://automationexercise.com/).\n        2.  Navigate to the Products page.\n        3.  Search for \"Dress\".\n        4.  Add the first displayed \"Dress\" product to the cart.\n        5.  Verify the product is added to the cart (e.g., a success message is displayed, the cart icon updates).\n        6.  Proceed to the Checkout page from the cart.\n        7.  Verify that the cart summary on the checkout page displays the added product.\n*   **Regression Suite (Future - Not part of this Smoke Strategy):**\n    *   *Note: Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document after the Smoke tests are stable.*\n    *   This will include:\n        *   Alternative search terms.\n        *   Adding multiple products.\n        *   Updating quantities in the cart.\n        *   Using coupon codes.\n        *   Different shipping addresses.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For this Smoke test, static test data is sufficient. We will use the search term \"Dress\". No user accounts are needed.\n    *   Future regression tests will require a more robust data strategy, potentially involving dynamic test data generation or a dedicated test data environment.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create Page Objects for:\n            *   HomePage\n            *   ProductsPage\n            *   CartPage\n            *   CheckoutPage\n    *   **Language:** [Choose language - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript]\n    *   **Testing Framework:** [Choose framework - e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Playwright]\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:** E-commerce sites often have dynamic content and asynchronous loading.\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to be visible or interactable before interacting with them. Avoid implicit waits.\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** For elements that load asynchronously, use polling assertions (retry mechanisms) to check for their presence or state.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Consider implementing basic self-healing capabilities, such as automatically refreshing the page if an element is not found after a reasonable wait time.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Focus Areas):**\n    1.  **Products Page:** The initial focus should be on the Products page (after navigation) and the search functionality.\n    2.  **Cart Page:** Ensure adding to cart works correctly and the cart page loads properly.\n    3.  **Checkout Page:** Verify that the cart summary is displayed correctly on the checkout page.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n        *   The Products page loads successfully.\n        *   Search results are displayed for the term \"Dress\".\n        *   The product is successfully added to the cart (e.g., a success message is displayed, the cart icon updates).\n        *   The cart page loads successfully and displays the added product.\n        *   The checkout page loads successfully and displays the added product in the cart summary.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   Any HTTP error codes (4xx, 5xx).\n        *   Exceptions or errors during test execution.\n        *   Incorrect product information displayed.\n        *   Inability to add the product to the cart.\n        *   Checkout page failing to load or displaying incorrect cart information.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the initial Smoke testing efforts on AutomationExercise.com. It emphasizes a focused approach on the core e-commerce flow, ensuring the platform's fundamental functionality is working as expected. This document will be updated as the testing progresses and new requirements emerge."
