  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (smoke). This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** AutomationExercise.com (E-commerce)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nAutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business functionality revolves around product browsing, adding items to cart, and completing the checkout process.  Any failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nA failure in the core flows (as defined in the user goal) can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative customer experience.\n*   **Loss of Customer Trust:** Perceived unreliability of the platform.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Navigation to the Products page.\n    *   Searching for a specific product (\"Dress\").\n    *   Adding the product to the shopping cart.\n    *   Navigating to the checkout page.\n    *   Verifying basic elements on the checkout page.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Detailed product page testing (reviews, descriptions, etc.).\n    *   Payment processing.\n    *   Shipping calculations.\n    *   User account management (login, registration).\n    *   All negative testing scenarios.\n    *   Responsive testing (mobile/tablet).\n    *   Accessibility testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of a single test case reflecting the user goal:\n\n1.  **Test Case:** \"Verify Basic Product Search and Checkout Navigation\"\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://automationexercise.com/`.\n        2.  Click on the \"Products\" link in the navigation bar.\n        3.  Enter \"Dress\" in the search bar and click the search button.\n        4.  Verify that at least one product with the name \"Dress\" is displayed in the search results.\n        5.  Add the first \"Dress\" product to the cart.\n        6.  Click on the \"View Cart\" button.\n        7.  Click on the \"Proceed To Checkout\" button.\n        8.  Verify that the checkout page is displayed.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*   **Note:** Since this is a *smoke* test strategy, the regression suite is not the primary focus. However, we should consider the following for future regression testing:\n    *   **Data-Driven Testing:** Parameterize the search term (e.g., search for \"Shirt\", \"Top\").\n    *   **Edge Cases:** Search for special characters or very long strings.\n    *   **Alternative Flows:**  Explore different ways to add the product to the cart (e.g., from the product details page).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** The search term \"Dress\" is considered static data for this smoke test.\n*   **Dynamic Data (Future):** For regression testing, consider using a data provider to supply a list of search terms.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a separate class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage`\n        *   `ProductsPage`\n        *   `CartPage`\n        *   `CheckoutPage`\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to be present or conditions to be met before proceeding. This helps to avoid false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts for critical elements to load.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., retry the test 1-2 times before marking it as a failure).\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically locate elements even if their locators change slightly.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** `https://automationexercise.com/` (Verify page load and navigation links).\n2.  **Products Page:** `https://automationexercise.com/products` (Verify product listing and search functionality).\n3.  **Cart Page:** `https://automationexercise.com/view_cart` (Verify cart contents and checkout button).\n4.  **Checkout Page:** `https://automationexercise.com/checkout` (Verify page load and basic elements).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   All steps in the smoke test case are executed without errors.\n    *   HTTP status code 200 for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant text elements are visible on each page (e.g., \"Products\", \"Cart\", \"Checkout\").\n    *   The correct product (\"Dress\") is added to the cart.\n    *   The checkout page loads successfully.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   Any step in the smoke test case fails.\n    *   HTTP status code other than 200 for any page request.\n    *   Expected text elements are not visible.\n    *   Errors are displayed on the page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the core functionality of AutomationExercise.com. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical areas of the application. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the quality and reliability of the platform."
