  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke).\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the test strategy for a critical smoke test of the AutomationExercise.com e-commerce platform. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding test automation and execution efforts.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** AutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business revolves around product discovery, purchase, and order fulfillment. Failure in any of these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failures can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative customer experiences due to broken functionality.\n    *   **Lost Sales:** Customers abandoning purchases due to errors.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Navigation to the Products page.\n        *   Product search functionality.\n        *   Adding products to the shopping cart.\n        *   Proceeding to the checkout process.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   User registration/login.\n        *   Payment processing (covered by separate, more in-depth testing).\n        *   Order history.\n        *   Account management.\n        *   Detailed product page elements beyond basic loading.\n        *   All negative testing scenarios.\n        *   Responsive design testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially focus on a single, primary browser).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Definition:** A minimal set of tests to verify the core functionality of product search, adding to cart, and navigating to checkout.\n    *   **Goal:** Ensure the application is in a generally working state after deployment or code changes. A failed smoke test indicates a critical issue that blocks further testing.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  Navigate to the Products Page.\n        2.  Search for \"Dress\".\n        3.  Add the first displayed \"Dress\" product to the cart.\n        4.  Navigate to the Cart page.\n        5.  Proceed to Checkout.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not executed during smoke testing)\n    *   **Definition:** A comprehensive suite of tests ensuring that recent changes have not broken existing functionality. Covers variations, edge cases, and error handling.\n    *   **Goal:** Ensure the application is working as expected after deployment or code changes.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  Navigate to the Products Page.\n        2.  Search for \"Dress\".\n        3.  Add the first displayed \"Dress\" product to the cart.\n        4.  Navigate to the Cart page.\n        5.  Update the quantity of the product in the cart.\n        6.  Remove the product from the cart.\n        7.  Proceed to Checkout.\n        8.  Apply a coupon code.\n        9.  Fill in the billing and shipping information.\n        10. Select a payment method.\n        11. Complete the purchase.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** For the smoke test, we can use static data (e.g., searching for the exact term \"Dress\"). This simplifies the initial setup.\n    *   **Future Consideration (Regression):** For more comprehensive regression testing, consider dynamic data generation (e.g., randomly searching for products from a predefined list) to increase test coverage and reduce test data maintenance.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n        *   Create separate page object classes for:\n            *   Products Page\n            *   Cart Page\n            *   Checkout Page\n        *   Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:** E-commerce sites often have dynamic content and asynchronous loading.\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_until` or similar) to wait for elements to become visible or for conditions to be met before proceeding. This avoids premature failures due to timing issues.\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to handle asynchronous operations.\n        *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Investigate self-healing techniques (e.g., using multiple locators for the same element) to automatically recover from minor UI changes.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for network-related issues or intermittent server errors.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Verify basic page load and navigation to the Products page.\n    2.  **Products Page:** Focus on the search functionality and product listing.\n    3.  **Product Detail Page (Quick View):** Verify the ability to add a product to the cart from the product listing.\n    4.  **Cart Page:** Verify the cart summary and the \"Proceed to Checkout\" button.\n    5.  **Checkout Page:** Verify the page loads successfully.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** All page requests should return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Key elements (e.g., search bar, product images, \"Add to Cart\" button, \"Proceed to Checkout\" button) must be visible and interactable.\n    *   **Cart Updates:** Verify that adding a product to the cart updates the cart summary (e.g., item count).\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify the presence of specific text elements (e.g., \"Shopping Cart\", \"Checkout\").\n    *   **No Critical Errors:** The application should not display any critical JavaScript errors or server-side exceptions.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust and reliable smoke test suite for AutomationExercise.com. It emphasizes risk mitigation, clear scope definition, and a resilient test architecture. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and testing needs change."
