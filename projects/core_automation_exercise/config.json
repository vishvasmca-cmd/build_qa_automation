  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke).\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** E-commerce. The core business revolves around product sales.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure to execute core flows (search, add to cart, checkout) directly impacts revenue and user trust. A broken checkout process is a P0 (Priority 0) incident.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Navigation to the Products page.\n        *   Searching for a specific product (\"Dress\").\n        *   Adding the product to the shopping cart.\n        *   Navigating to the checkout page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   User registration/login.\n        *   Payment processing (simulated success is sufficient for smoke).\n        *   Detailed product information validation (beyond basic existence).\n        *   Coupon codes.\n        *   Shipping calculations.\n        *   Order history.\n        *   Account management.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid search terms).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Overall Approach:** This smoke test will validate the core \"happy path\" of product discovery and initiating the checkout process.  It's designed to be a quick, reliable indicator of system health.\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Product Search and Checkout Initiation**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://automationexercise.com/`.\n        2.  Navigate to the \"Products\" page.\n        3.  Search for \"Dress\".\n        4.  Add the first displayed \"Dress\" product to the cart.\n        5.  Navigate to the cart.\n        6.  Proceed to checkout.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** The search term \"Dress\" is considered static data for this smoke test.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  While the product listing might change, the test should be resilient enough to select the *first* \"Dress\" product returned in the search results.  This avoids hardcoding specific product names/IDs.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM) is highly recommended. This will improve maintainability and readability.\n    *   Create Page Objects for:\n        *   HomePage\n        *   ProductsPage\n        *   CartPage\n        *   CheckoutPage\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) when navigating between pages or after adding an item to the cart. This accounts for potential loading delays.\n    *   **Element Locators:**  Prioritize robust element locators (e.g., CSS selectors with specific attributes) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on text).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for adding the product to the cart, in case of intermittent failures.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to catch exceptions and log meaningful error messages.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Products Page:** Focus on the search functionality and product listing.\n    2.  **Cart Page:** Verify the added product is displayed correctly.\n    3.  **Checkout Page:** Ensure the checkout page loads without errors.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** All page requests should return HTTP 200 (OK).\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Key elements on each page (e.g., search bar, product images, cart summary, checkout button) must be visible.\n    *   **Text Verification:**\n        *   Verify that the search results display products containing the word \"Dress\".\n        *   Verify that the cart summary displays the correct product name and quantity.\n    *   **No Critical Errors:** The test should not encounter any unhandled exceptions or JavaScript errors.\n*   **Reporting:**  The test should generate a clear pass/fail result, along with detailed logs in case of failure.  Include screenshots of each step for easier debugging.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for implementing the smoke test for AutomationExercise.com. It prioritizes critical functionality and incorporates best practices for test architecture and execution.  This document will be updated as needed based on evolving requirements and system changes."
