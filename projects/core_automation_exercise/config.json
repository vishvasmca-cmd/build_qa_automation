  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke). This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://automationexercise.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nAutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform.  In this domain, the ability for users to successfully search for products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout is *critical*. Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and user satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to complete purchases results in immediate revenue loss.\n*   **Reputational Damage:**  A broken checkout process leads to frustrated customers and negative reviews.\n*   **Loss of Trust:**  Unreliable core functionality erodes user trust and reduces repeat business.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Navigation to the Products page.\n    *   Product search functionality.\n    *   Adding products to the shopping cart.\n    *   Navigating to the checkout page.\n    *   Basic checkout flow (guest or registered user, if applicable).\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Detailed product page testing (reviews, specifications, etc.).\n    *   Payment gateway integration (simulated payment is acceptable for smoke).\n    *   User account creation/management (beyond basic checkout).\n    *   Order history.\n    *   Detailed cart functionality (quantity updates, coupon codes).\n    *   Responsive design testing.\n    *   Accessibility testing.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS).\n    *   Negative testing (invalid search terms, etc.).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be the *absolute minimum* set of tests to verify the core functionality is operational.  If any of these tests fail, the build is considered broken and should be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Navigate to Products Page:** Verify the Products page loads successfully.\n    2.  **Search for \"Dress\":** Verify search results are displayed when searching for \"Dress\".\n    3.  **Add Dress to Cart:** Verify a dress can be added to the shopping cart.\n    4.  **Navigate to Checkout:** Verify the user can navigate to the checkout page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*Not applicable for this Smoke Test Strategy.* A full regression suite would be defined later, covering variations, edge cases, and error handling.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nFor the Smoke tests, a *static data* approach is sufficient.\n\n*   **Search Term:**  \"Dress\" (This is hardcoded into the test).\n*   **Product Selection:**  The first dress displayed in the search results will be added to the cart.  This simplifies the test and reduces dependencies on specific product availability.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n\n    *   Example: `HomePage`, `ProductsPage`, `CartPage`, `CheckoutPage`.\n    *   Each page object should contain:\n        *   Locators for elements on the page (e.g., search box, add to cart button).\n        *   Methods to interact with those elements (e.g., `enterSearchTerm()`, `clickAddToCart()`).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\nFlakiness is a common challenge in UI automation.  The following strategies should be implemented:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions (Wait Strategies):**  Instead of immediately asserting that an element is visible, use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for the element to appear.  This accounts for potential delays in page loading.  Set reasonable timeouts (e.g., 5-10 seconds).\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for critical actions (e.g., clicking a button).  If an action fails, retry it a limited number of times (e.g., 2-3) before failing the test.\n*   **Element Existence Checks:** Before interacting with an element, verify that it exists on the page.  This prevents `NoSuchElementException` errors.\n*   **Screenshot on Failure:** Capture a screenshot whenever a test fails.  This provides valuable context for debugging.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Exploration Order)\n\nThe autonomous agent (if used) should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows in this order:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify basic page load and navigation elements.\n2.  **Products Page:** Focus on search functionality and product listing.\n3.  **Product Detail Page (of the first \"Dress\" result):** Verify product information and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n4.  **Cart Page:** Verify the added product is present and the \"Proceed to Checkout\" button is functional.\n5.  **Checkout Page:** Verify the page loads and displays basic checkout information.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\nSuccess is defined by the following:\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** All page requests should return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Key elements (e.g., search box, product listings, cart summary, checkout button) must be visible on the page.\n*   **Text Verification:**  Verify specific text elements are present (e.g., \"Products\", \"Shopping Cart\", \"Checkout\").\n*   **Cart Contents:**  Verify the correct product (\"Dress\") is added to the cart.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the core functionality of AutomationExercise.com. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical areas of the application. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can build a robust and reliable testing framework that ensures the quality of the application."
