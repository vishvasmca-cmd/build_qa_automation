  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for automationexercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (Smoke).\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** AutomationExercise.com (E-commerce)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nAutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform.  In this domain, the **Checkout process is considered P0 (Priority 0)**, meaning its failure has the most significant impact on revenue and user experience. The Product Catalog and Search functionalities are also critical for driving sales.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nA failure in the specified user goal (Navigate to Products, search for 'Dress', add to cart, and go to checkout) can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability for users to purchase products.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user experience leading to loss of trust and potential churn.\n*   **Lost Sales Opportunities:** Users abandoning the site due to frustration.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Navigation to the Products page.\n    *   Search functionality for the term \"Dress\".\n    *   Adding a \"Dress\" product to the shopping cart.\n    *   Navigating to the Checkout page from the shopping cart.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   User registration/login.\n    *   Payment processing (this is a smoke test, we assume payment gateway is functional).\n    *   Detailed product description page validation (beyond basic loading).\n    *   Coupon code application.\n    *   Shipping address selection.\n    *   Order confirmation.\n    *   All negative testing scenarios.\n    *   Responsive testing (mobile/tablet).\n    *   Accessibility testing.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   API testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThis smoke suite will verify the core functionality required for a user to initiate a purchase.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Product Search and Add to Cart**\n    1.  Navigate to the homepage (https://automationexercise.com/).\n    2.  Navigate to the Products page.\n    3.  Search for \"Dress\".\n    4.  Select the first displayed \"Dress\" product.\n    5.  Add the selected \"Dress\" product to the cart.\n    6.  Navigate to the Cart page.\n    7.  Proceed to Checkout.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.*\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** The search term \"Dress\" is static.\n*   **Dynamic Data:** The specific \"Dress\" product selected can be dynamic (e.g., always select the first result).  This avoids hardcoding specific product names/IDs that might change.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended.  Create separate page objects for:\n    *   HomePage\n    *   ProductsPage\n    *   ProductDetailPage\n    *   CartPage\n    *   CheckoutPage\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (wait-until conditions) to handle potential loading delays, especially when navigating between pages or adding items to the cart.  This prevents false failures due to timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts (e.g., 5-10 seconds) for elements to become visible or interactable.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for adding items to the cart, in case of intermittent failures.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify basic page load and navigation links.\n2.  **Products Page:** Focus on the search functionality and product listing.\n3.  **Product Detail Page:** Ensure product details are displayed correctly.\n4.  **Cart Page:** Verify the added product is present and the \"Proceed to Checkout\" button is functional.\n5.  **Checkout Page:** Verify the page loads successfully.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   All HTTP requests return a 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   The Products page loads successfully after navigation.\n    *   Search results for \"Dress\" are displayed.\n    *   The selected \"Dress\" product is successfully added to the cart.\n    *   The Cart page displays the added \"Dress\" product.\n    *   The Checkout page loads successfully.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   Any HTTP request returns an error code (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Elements are not found within the specified timeout.\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions are encountered.\n    *   The Checkout page fails to load."
