  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for AutomationExercise.com, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (smoke). This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and efficient testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nAutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business function is selling products online. Therefore, the ability for users to browse, add items to the cart, and proceed to checkout is of *critical* importance.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure in the specified user goal (Navigate to Products, search for 'Dress', add to cart, and go to checkout) directly impacts revenue generation.  Specifically:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to complete purchases results in lost sales.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** A broken checkout process leads to user frustration and negative brand perception.\n*   **Customer Churn:** Users may abandon the platform and seek alternatives if the core shopping experience is unreliable.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Navigation to the Products page.\n    *   Search functionality for products.\n    *   Adding a product to the shopping cart.\n    *   Navigating to the checkout page.\n    *   Verification of basic cart contents on the checkout page.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Payment processing (covered in separate, more comprehensive testing).\n    *   User account creation/login (covered in Authentication module testing).\n    *   Detailed product information verification (beyond basic existence).\n    *   Shipping calculations.\n    *   Coupon code application.\n    *   Order placement.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThis smoke suite will serve as the \"Health Check\" for each build. If any of these tests fail, the build is considered unstable and should be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Product Search and Add to Cart**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://automationexercise.com/`.\n    2.  Navigate to the \"Products\" page.\n    3.  Search for \"Dress\".\n    4.  Select the first dress displayed.\n    5.  Add the dress to the cart.\n    6.  Click \"View Cart\".\n    7.  Verify that the cart page loads.\n    8.  Click \"Proceed to Checkout\".\n    9.  Verify that the checkout page loads.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Future Expansion)\n\nWhile this document focuses on smoke testing, here's a preview of how the regression suite would expand upon this:\n\n*   **Variations:**\n    *   Searching for different product types (e.g., \"Shirt\", \"Jeans\").\n    *   Adding multiple items to the cart.\n    *   Verifying product details on the cart page (name, price, quantity).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Searching for a product that doesn't exist.\n    *   Attempting to add an out-of-stock item to the cart.\n    *   Handling empty cart scenarios.\n*   **Negative Scenarios:**\n    *   Attempting to proceed to checkout with an empty cart (verify appropriate error message).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nFor smoke tests, we will use *static* test data. This means pre-defined product names (\"Dress\") and expected results. This ensures consistency and predictability. For regression tests, we will explore dynamic test data generation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nImplement a **Page Object Model (POM)** structure. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n\n*   **Page Objects:**\n    *   HomePage (for navigating to Products)\n    *   ProductsPage (for searching and selecting products)\n    *   ProductDetailPage (for adding to cart)\n    *   CartPage (for viewing cart contents and proceeding to checkout)\n    *   CheckoutPage (for verifying checkout page load)\n*   **Test Cases:** Reside separately and utilize the Page Objects.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\nAddress potential flakiness in UI tests:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) instead of immediate assertions to account for page load times.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to handle asynchronous operations.\n*   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., automatically retrying failed actions) for intermittent issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Ensure the \"Products\" link is accessible and functional.\n2.  **Products Page:** Focus on the search functionality and product listing.\n3.  **Product Detail Page:** Verify the \"Add to Cart\" button is present and functional.\n4.  **Cart Page:** Ensure the cart summary is displayed correctly and the \"Proceed to Checkout\" button is functional.\n5.  **Checkout Page:** Verify the page loads successfully.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\nSuccess is defined by the following:\n\n*   **HTTP Status Code:** All page requests should return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Key elements (e.g., search bar, product images, \"Add to Cart\" button, \"Proceed to Checkout\" button) must be visible on the appropriate pages.\n*   **Text Verification:** Verify the presence of specific text elements (e.g., \"Cart\", \"Checkout\") to confirm page content.\n*   **Navigation:** Successful navigation between pages as defined in the test cases.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust smoke testing suite for AutomationExercise.com. It emphasizes critical functionality, risk mitigation, and a structured approach to test automation. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves."
