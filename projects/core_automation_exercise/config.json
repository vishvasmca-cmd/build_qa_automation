This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** AutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. The core business revolves around product discovery, purchase, and order fulfillment. Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High Risk:** Checkout process failures (payment processing, order placement) leading to lost revenue and customer frustration.\n    *   **Medium Risk:** Product search and discovery issues (incorrect results, broken filters) leading to reduced sales.\n    *   **Low Risk:** Minor UI glitches or cosmetic issues that don't impede core functionality.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Navigation to the Products page.\n        *   Product search functionality.\n        *   Adding products to the cart.\n        *   Checkout process (up to order confirmation - payment gateway integration is out of scope for this initial strategy).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Payment gateway integration (simulated payment success/failure is acceptable).\n        *   User account management (registration, profile editing).\n        *   Detailed product page reviews and ratings.\n        *   All API testing (focus on UI for this initial strategy).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially focus on desktop).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nGiven the request is for a SMOKE test, the strategy will focus on the 'Happy Path' to ensure core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core functionality of the application after deployment or code changes. A failed smoke test indicates a critical issue that needs immediate attention.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Navigate to Products Page:** Verify the \"Products\" link in the navigation bar is functional and leads to the product listing page.\n        2.  **Search for \"Dress\":** Verify the search functionality returns relevant product results when searching for \"Dress\".\n        3.  **Add First Dress to Cart:** Verify the first dress in the search results can be added to the cart successfully.\n        4.  **Navigate to Checkout:** Verify the \"Cart\" icon/link is functional and leads to the checkout page.\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After every build, deployment, or significant code change.\n*   **Regression Suite (Future):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To ensure that new changes haven't introduced regressions in existing functionality. This will be developed in a later phase.\n    *   **Example Test Cases (Future):**\n        *   Verify different search terms (e.g., \"Shirt\", \"T-Shirt\").\n        *   Verify adding multiple items to the cart.\n        *   Verify updating quantities in the cart.\n        *   Verify removing items from the cart.\n        *   Verify applying coupon codes (valid and invalid).\n        *   Verify different shipping addresses.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** For the smoke tests, use static data (e.g., predefined search term \"Dress\").\n    *   **Dynamic Generation (Future):** For regression tests, consider dynamic generation of data (e.g., generating random email addresses for registration).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n        *   Create separate page objects for:\n            *   HomePage\n            *   ProductsPage\n            *   CartPage\n            *   CheckoutPage\n        *   Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable. This helps to avoid false failures due to timing issues.\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to target specific elements and conditions.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed test steps, especially for network-related issues.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):**\n        *   Consider using AI-powered self-healing tools to automatically identify and fix broken locators. This can significantly reduce test maintenance effort.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Focus on the navigation bar, especially the \"Products\" link.\n    2.  **Products Page:** Focus on the search input field and the product listing.\n    3.  **Product Detail Page (First Dress):** Focus on the \"Add to Cart\" button.\n    4.  **Cart Page:** Focus on the \"Proceed to Checkout\" button.\n    5.  **Checkout Page:** Focus on the address form and the \"Place Order\" button (simulate payment success).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return HTTP 200 (OK).\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that key elements (e.g., search results, cart items, checkout form) are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text (e.g., \"Product added to cart\", \"Checkout\") is displayed correctly.\n    *   **Functional Verification:** Verify that actions (e.g., adding to cart, proceeding to checkout) are performed successfully.\n    *   **Success Definition:** All smoke test cases must pass without errors. A single failure indicates a critical issue.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust and reliable testing framework for AutomationExercise.com. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and the testing needs change."
