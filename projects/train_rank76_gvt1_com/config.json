  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: GVT1.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the GVT1.com website. It serves as the guiding document for all testing activities related to verifying the core functionality and stability of the application.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** GVT1.com is a general web application. Without further information, we assume a standard risk profile associated with website availability and basic functionality. Failure to load or access core features can lead to user frustration and potential loss of engagement.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Website unavailability, critical errors on key pages (homepage, login).\n    *   **Medium:** Broken links, missing elements on key pages.\n    *   **Low:** Minor UI inconsistencies, non-critical errors.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading of the homepage.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of Login, Signup/GetStarted, and any other 5 prominent buttons on the homepage.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of 2 prominent links on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of any button or link (no clicking).\n        *   Form validation.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n        *   Error handling beyond initial page load.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Button Presence:** Verify the presence of \"Login\", \"Signup/GetStarted\", and any other 5 prominent buttons.\n        3.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of 2 prominent links.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of 2 menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke testing. Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability and scalability as testing expands.\n    *   Consider using a framework like Selenium WebDriver with a simple assertion library (e.g., JUnit, TestNG, pytest).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for element to be present) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Timeout Configuration:** Configure reasonable timeouts for element loading (e.g., 5-10 seconds).\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage Load:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Button Presence:** Elements with text matching \"Login\", \"Signup/GetStarted\", and any other 5 prominent buttons are present on the page.\n    *   **Link Presence:** At least 2 `<a>` elements are present on the page.\n    *   **Menu Bar Presence:** At least 2 `<nav>` or `<ul>` elements with `<li>` children are present on the page.\n    *   **No Critical Errors:** No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for smoke testing GVT1.com. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the stability and core functionality of the website are consistently verified."
