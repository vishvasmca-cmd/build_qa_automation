# Test Plan: train_rank76_gvt1_com

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for train_rank76_gvt1_com, focusing on verifying the core functionality of the website. The tests will cover critical user flows and ensure the stability and reliability of the application.

## 2. Scope

The testing will cover the following areas:

*   Website launch and basic element identification (buttons, links, menu bars).

## 3. Test Strategy

The testing strategy will employ a combination of smoke and regression testing.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite will focus on verifying the most critical functionalities of the application. The following checklist will be applied:

1.  **Critical Path Coverage:** Tests cover essential user flows (e.g., website launch).
2.  **Core Functionality:** Tests validate the primary functions of the application (e.g., element identification).
3.  **Positive Testing:** Focus on successful scenarios.
4.  **Minimal Complexity:** Tests are simple and straightforward.
5.  **Fast Execution:** Tests should execute quickly to provide rapid feedback.
6.  **Build Validation:** Smoke tests determine whether a build is stable enough for further testing.
7.  **High Priority:** Smoke tests are given the highest priority.
8.  **Automated Execution:** Smoke tests are automated for continuous integration.

### Regression Suite Strategy

The regression suite will provide a more comprehensive test coverage, including alternative flows, negative scenarios, and boundary conditions.  This suite is not defined based on the provided trace, but would be developed in a full testing effort.

## 4. Test Environment

The tests will be executed in a standard web browser environment (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## 5. Test Deliverables

The following test deliverables will be produced:

*   Test Plan document
*   Gherkin feature files
*   Test execution reports

## 6. Test Schedule

The test execution will be performed according to the project schedule.
