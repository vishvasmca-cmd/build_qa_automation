  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan for Moderna's website, designed to guide autonomous agents in performing smoke tests before any detailed automation is implemented.\n\n# Master Test Plan: ModernaTX.com - Smoke Tests\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Version:** 1.0\n**Prepared By:** AI QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for performing smoke tests on ModernaTX.com.  The purpose of these tests is to quickly verify the core functionality of the website and ensure its stability and availability. This plan will guide the autonomous agents on which elements to mine, what to verify, and the overall structure of the suite.\n\n## 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\n*   **Website URL:** `https://www.modernatx.com`\n*   **Business Domain:** Healthcare (Biotechnology - mRNA Therapeutics and Vaccines)\n*   **Domain Analysis:** ModernaTX.com serves as the primary online presence for Moderna, a biotechnology company focused on mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. The site likely aims to:\n    *   Provide information about Moderna's research and development pipeline.\n    *   Offer details on its approved products (e.g., COVID-19 vaccine).\n    *   Share information about the company's mission, values, and leadership.\n    *   Attract investors through investor relations content.\n    *   Recruit talent by showcasing career opportunities.\n    *   Provide access to resources for healthcare professionals and patients.\n    *   Publish news and updates related to Moderna's activities.\n*   **Critical Areas:** Given the domain, the most critical areas for initial smoke tests will be:\n    *   Homepage accessibility and content accuracy.\n    *   Navigation to key sections like \"Products/Pipeline,\" \"Investors,\" and \"Careers.\"\n    *   Information regarding COVID-19 vaccine, if prominently featured.\n\n## 3. Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Basic website accessibility (site is up and loading).\n    *   Core navigation functionality (menu links).\n    *   Homepage headline verification.\n    *   Basic link verification of key \"Learn More\" calls to action.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Detailed functional testing of specific forms or applications.\n    *   Performance testing or load testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n    *   Responsiveness testing across different devices/browsers (initially).\n    *   Accessibility compliance testing (WCAG).\n    *   Testing of third-party integrations (e.g., social media feeds).\n\n## 4. Smoke Test Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke test suite will consist of the following key tests:\n\n### 4.1 Basic Availability Check\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the ModernaTX.com homepage is accessible and returns a 200 OK HTTP status code.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.modernatx.com`.\n    2.  Check the HTTP status code.\n*   **Expected Result:** The homepage should load successfully with a 200 OK status code.\n\n### 4.2 Core Navigation Tests\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the main navigation menu links are functional and navigate to the correct pages.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.modernatx.com`.\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu.  (Agent Instruction: Mine the `nav` element with role=\"navigation\" or aria-label=\"Main Navigation\").\n    3.  For each top-level menu item (e.g., \"Science & Technology,\" \"Products,\" \"Investors,\" \"Careers\"):\n        *   Click the link.\n        *   Verify that the page loads successfully (200 OK).\n        *   Verify that the URL changes to the expected URL based on the link text.\n*   **Expected Result:** All main navigation links should navigate to their corresponding pages without errors.\n\n### 4.3 Core Flow: Verify Headline and \"Learn More\" Link\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Description:** Verify the main headline on the homepage and a key \"Learn More\" link.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.modernatx.com`.\n    2.  Locate the main headline.  (Agent Instruction: Mine the `h1` element on the page, prioritizing the one with the largest font size or closest to the top of the page).\n    3.  Verify that the headline text matches an expected value (e.g., \"A pioneering mRNA technology platform.\").  *Note: This expected value should be updated as the site content changes.*\n    4.  Locate a prominent \"Learn More\" link on the homepage. (Agent Instruction: Mine all `a` elements containing the text \"Learn More\". Prioritize buttons or links within the main content area).\n    5.  Click the \"Learn More\" link.\n    6.  Verify that the page loads successfully (200 OK).\n*   **Expected Result:** The headline should be displayed correctly, and the \"Learn More\" link should navigate to a relevant page without errors.\n\n## 5. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nTo optimize the autonomous agent's exploration and testing, provide the following strategic mining instructions:\n\n*   **Prioritize `nav` elements:** Specifically target `<nav>` elements with `role=\"navigation\"` or `aria-label=\"Main Navigation\"` to identify the main navigation menu.\n*   **Homepage Headline:** Focus on mining the primary `<h1>` tag on the homepage. Prioritize the `<h1>` with the largest font size or the one located closest to the top of the page.\n*   **\"Learn More\" Links:**  Mine all `<a>` elements containing the text \"Learn More\".  Prioritize those that are styled as buttons or are within the main content section of the homepage.\n*   **Dynamic Content Handling:** Be aware that the homepage headline and content may change frequently. The agent should be able to adapt to these changes by focusing on the *presence* of the headline and the *functionality* of the \"Learn More\" link rather than strict text matching (where possible).\n*   **Error Handling:** The agent should be configured to capture and report any HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx) encountered during navigation.\n\n## 6. Test Environment\n\n*   **Environment:** Production (`https://www.modernatx.com`)\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest stable version) - Initial focus.  Expand to other browsers later.\n\n## 7. Test Data\n\n*   No specific test data is required for these smoke tests.\n\n## 8. Reporting\n\n*   The autonomous agent should generate a clear and concise test report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n*   The report should include details of any errors encountered, including HTTP status codes, screenshots (if possible), and timestamps.\n\n## 9. Success Criteria\n\n*   All smoke test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable enough for further testing.\n\n## 10. Future Considerations\n\n*   As the website evolves, this Master Test Plan should be updated to reflect new features and functionality.\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to include additional critical flows, such as form submissions and search functionality.\n*   Incorporate accessibility testing into the smoke test suite.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for performing effective smoke tests on ModernaTX.com. By following these guidelines, autonomous agents can quickly identify critical issues and ensure the website's stability."
