  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: EdgeCDN.ru - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the EdgeCDN.ru website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** EdgeCDN.ru appears to be a general web application, potentially offering CDN services or related technologies. The business criticality depends on the specific services offered and the impact of downtime on their users.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionality (e.g., website availability, login) can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust from potential and existing customers.\n    *   **Business Disruption:** Inability for users to access services.\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Potential loss of revenue due to service unavailability.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially, focus on desktop).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health and accessibility of the EdgeCDN.ru website.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n        *   Login button/link\n        *   Signup/GetStarted button/link\n        *   Try for Free button/link (or similar call to action)\n        *   Two additional buttons/links (any prominent buttons/links on the homepage)\n        *   Two links (any prominent links on the homepage)\n        *   Two menu bars (verify they are present, not necessarily functional)\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined separately.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\nThis section provides guidance for the test architecture to ensure maintainability and resilience.\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the website's pages and their elements. This will improve code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java` (or similar): Contains locators and methods for interacting with the homepage elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Example:** Wait for the Login button to be present before asserting its existence.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\nThis section provides specific instructions for executing the smoke tests.\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Availability:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    2.  **Element Presence:** Each specified button, link, and menu bar must be present on the page (visible and accessible).\n    3.  **No Exceptions:** The test should not throw any exceptions (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the EdgeCDN.ru website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the core functionality of the application is verified effectively."
