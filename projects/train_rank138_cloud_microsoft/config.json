  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Microsoft Cloud Website - Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The target is the Microsoft Cloud website, a critical marketing and sales platform. Failure can lead to lost leads, damaged brand reputation, and reduced sales.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. Website unavailability or critical functionality failure directly impacts Microsoft's ability to acquire new customers and serve existing ones.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and load.\n        *   Presence of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Basic rendering of the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu bars (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing (beyond basic load).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the Microsoft Cloud website is accessible and presents the core elements required for user interaction.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Generic x2):** Verify the presence of any two other distinct buttons on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Presence (Generic x2):** Verify the presence of any two distinct links on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (x2):** Verify the presence of two distinct menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No test data is required for this smoke test, as we are only verifying the presence of UI elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure. Create a `HomePage` object containing locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars. This promotes maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible`) to handle potential delays in element rendering. This reduces flakiness due to timing issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for website load failures. A temporary network issue should not cause the entire smoke test to fail.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage:** `https://cloud.microsoft`\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present in the DOM and are visible on the page. Use appropriate CSS selectors or XPath expressions to locate the elements.\n    *   **No Clicks:** The autonomous agent should *not* click on any of the identified elements. The goal is solely to verify their presence.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clearly report which elements were found and which were not.\n    *   Include screenshots of the homepage in the test report to provide visual confirmation."
