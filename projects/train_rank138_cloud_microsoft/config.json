  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Microsoft Cloud Website - Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: The Microsoft Cloud website serves as a primary entry point for potential and existing customers to access cloud services. Failure of this website can lead to significant loss of potential revenue, damage to brand reputation, and erosion of customer trust.\n*   **Risk Profile**: High. Website unavailability or critical functionality failure (e.g., login, signup) directly impacts business operations and customer acquisition.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, and specified links and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence and visibility of these elements.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Navigation to other pages.\n        *   Form submission or data entry.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of individual cloud services.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**: This suite will serve as a \"Health Check\" to ensure the website is operational and key elements are present.\n    1.  **Website Launch**: Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **UI Element Identification**: Verify the presence and visibility of the following elements:\n        *   Login button\n        *   Signup/Get Started button (or equivalent)\n        *   Try for Free button (or equivalent)\n        *   Two distinct links (e.g., \"Learn More\", \"Contact Us\")\n        *   Two distinct menu bars (e.g., \"Products\", \"Solutions\")\n*   **Regression Suite**: Not applicable for this smoke test strategy.\n*   **Data Strategy**: No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as we are only verifying the presence of UI elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**: Page Object Model (POM). This will allow for easy maintenance and scalability as the website evolves.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` Page Object that encapsulates the locators and methods for interacting with the home page elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., wait-until) to handle potential loading delays of UI elements. This will reduce flakiness due to timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Implement explicit waits for elements to be present and visible before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for element identification in case of intermittent loading issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Homepage**: `https://cloud.microsoft`\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    1.  **Website Launch**: HTTP 200 OK status code.\n    2.  **UI Element Identification**:\n        *   Each specified button, link, and menu bar is present in the DOM.\n        *   Each specified button, link, and menu bar is visible on the page (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()` returns `true`).\n        *   Verify the text of the buttons and links are as expected (e.g., \"Login\", \"Signup\").\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each verification step.\n    *   Detailed error messages for any failed tests, including element locators and screenshots."
