  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: cdn77.org - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for smoke testing the cdn77.org website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** cdn77.org provides Content Delivery Network (CDN) services. Website availability and basic functionality are crucial for lead generation and customer acquisition.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or critical elements to function (e.g., login, signup) can lead to immediate loss of potential customers and damage to brand reputation. This is considered a high-risk scenario.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading of the homepage.\n        *   Identification of key elements on the homepage: Login, Signup/GetStarted, and any other 3 prominent buttons.\n        *   Identification of 2 prominent links on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Testing functionality beyond the homepage (e.g., clicking buttons, navigating to other pages).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially).\n        *   API testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Button Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons, including \"Login\" and \"Signup/GetStarted\" (or similar call-to-action).\n        3.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 prominent links.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the homepage. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class with methods to identify buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Element Existence Checks:** Before interacting with an element, verify its existence using `isDisplayed()` or similar methods.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://cdn77.org):** This is the primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Button Identification:**\n        *   Element is present on the page.\n        *   Element is a button (e.g., `<button>` tag or `role=\"button\"` attribute).\n        *   At least one button contains the text \"Login\" (case-insensitive).\n        *   At least one button contains the text \"Signup\", \"Get Started\", or \"Try for Free\" (case-insensitive).\n    *   **Link Identification:**\n        *   Element is present on the page.\n        *   Element is a link (e.g., `<a>` tag with `href` attribute).\n    *   **Menu Bar Identification:**\n        *   Element is present on the page.\n        *   Element is a navigation element (e.g., `<nav>` tag or `role=\"navigation\"` attribute).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the cdn77.org website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that critical functionality is verified early and often, reducing the risk of major issues in production."
