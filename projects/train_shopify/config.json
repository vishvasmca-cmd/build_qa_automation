Focus on the hero section and primary call-to-action buttons.\n    *   **Sign-up Page:** The page reached after clicking \"Start Free Trial\".

Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the Smoke Test Suite to include more critical user flows (e.g., product search, checkout process).\n*   Implement cross-browser compatibility testing.\n*   Integrate with a CI/CD pipeline for automated execution."
