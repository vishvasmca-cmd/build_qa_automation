  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Telegram Website Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nTelegram (t.me) is a messaging platform. Its website serves as a marketing and informational portal, as well as a potential entry point for new users. The business criticality lies in user acquisition and brand reputation.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the Telegram website can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Potential Users:** If the website is down or key functionalities are broken, new users may be unable to sign up or learn about the platform.\n*   **Damage to Brand Reputation:** A buggy or inaccessible website can erode user trust and negatively impact the brand image.\n*   **Reduced User Engagement:** Existing users may be unable to access important information or updates.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Website availability and basic functionality.\n*   Loading of key pages (Homepage).\n*   Identification of key UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   Verification of the presence of critical calls to action (Login, Signup/Get Started, etc.).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed functional testing of the Telegram application itself.\n*   Performance testing (load times, scalability).\n*   Security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n*   Compatibility testing (browser/device combinations).\n*   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n*   Negative testing (e.g., invalid input).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will focus on verifying the core health of the Telegram website.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Website Availability:** Verify that the website (https://t.me) loads successfully and returns an HTTP 200 status code.\n    2.  **Homepage Load:** Verify that the homepage loads within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n    3.  **Key Button Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 5 of the following buttons (or similar):\n        *   Login\n        *   Sign Up / Get Started\n        *   Try for Free\n        *   Download\n        *   Learn More\n        *   View Pricing\n    4.  **Key Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n    5.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*   N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined separately.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Data Handling:** No specific test data is required for the smoke test. The tests will primarily focus on UI element identification and website availability.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Recommended for future test automation. Create Page Objects for the Homepage. This will improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential timing issues when verifying the presence of UI elements. This will help reduce flakiness. For example, poll for up to 5 seconds to see if a button becomes visible before failing the test.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\n*   **Primary Target:** Telegram Homepage (https://t.me)\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Website Availability:** HTTP status code 200.\n*   **Homepage Load:** Page loads completely without errors.\n*   **Key Button Identification:** Buttons are present and visible on the page.\n*   **Key Link Identification:** Links are present and visible on the page.\n*   **Menu Bar Identification:** Menu bars are present and visible on the page.\n\n**Success Definition:** All smoke tests pass, indicating that the core functionality of the Telegram website is operational."
