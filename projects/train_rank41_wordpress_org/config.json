  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: WordPress.org Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nWordPress.org is a critical website for the WordPress open-source project. It serves as a central hub for downloads, documentation, community support, and information about WordPress.\n\n*   **Business Criticality:** High. The website's availability and functionality directly impact the WordPress community, developers, and users. Failure can lead to frustration, hinder development efforts, and damage the project's reputation.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Indirect. Downtime or critical errors could impact businesses relying on WordPress, leading to potential revenue loss for them.\n*   **Data Breach:** Low (primarily informational website, not handling sensitive user data directly).\n*   **Trust Loss:** High. Frequent outages or broken functionality would erode trust in the WordPress project.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** High. A poorly functioning website reflects negatively on the WordPress project and its contributors.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Website availability and basic functionality.\n*   Loading of key pages (Homepage).\n*   Presence and basic functionality of critical elements (buttons, links, menus).\n*   Basic navigation to key areas (Download, Documentation, Community).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed functionality of downloaded software.\n*   Performance testing (beyond basic load time).\n*   Security testing (beyond basic checks for obvious vulnerabilities).\n*   Database interactions (beyond verifying the website loads).\n*   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n*   Accessibility testing (initially).\n*   All sub-pages beyond the main landing page and those directly linked from the main navigation.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThis suite verifies the core functionality of the WordPress.org website. Failure of any test in this suite indicates a critical issue and should halt further testing.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n    2.  **Button Presence:** Verify the presence of at least five key buttons (e.g., \"Get WordPress\", \"Download\", \"Try WordPress\", \"Showcase\", \"Blog\").\n    3.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of at least two key links (e.g., \"About\", \"Support\").\n    4.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of at least two menu bars (e.g., primary navigation, footer navigation).\n    5.  **Login Link Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" link.\n    6.  **Signup/Get Started Link Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" link.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*Not applicable for a smoke test.*  A regression suite would be defined *after* the smoke tests are stable and would cover more in-depth functionality, edge cases, and negative scenarios.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** The smoke tests will primarily rely on verifying the *presence* of elements. No dynamic test data is required.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create Page Objects for the Homepage. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitForElementVisible`) to handle potential timing issues with element loading.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests (e.g., retry a test up to 3 times before marking it as failed).  This can help mitigate flaky tests caused by network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should focus on the following areas *first*:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** `https://wordpress.org`\n2.  **Header Navigation:** Identify and verify the presence of key menu items.\n3.  **Footer:** Identify and verify the presence of key links and information.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for the homepage.\n    *   All specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page.\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP status code other than 200.\n    *   Any of the specified buttons, links, or menu bars are missing.\n    *   JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the smoke testing of WordPress.org. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical functionality to ensure the website's availability and basic usability. This document will be updated as the testing process evolves and new requirements emerge."
