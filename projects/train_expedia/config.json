  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan for Expedia.com focusing on smoke testing and the specified user goal. This plan is designed to guide autonomous agents in efficiently exploring and verifying key aspects of the website.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Expedia.com - Smoke Test\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for a smoke test of Expedia.com.  The goal is to ensure the site is operational, core navigation is functional, and a key user flow (searching for travel) is accessible.  This test plan serves as a blueprint for automated agents to effectively assess the website's health and core functionality.\n\n**2. Domain Information & Analysis**\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.expedia.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Ecommerce - Travel (Flights, Hotels, Cars, Packages, Activities)\n*   **Business Goal:**  To provide users with a comprehensive platform for booking travel-related services and products. Success is measured by bookings, user engagement, and customer satisfaction.\n*   **Key User Personas:**\n    *   **Leisure Traveler:**  Individuals or families planning vacations.\n    *   **Business Traveler:** Individuals traveling for work.\n    *   **Last-Minute Traveler:** Individuals needing to book travel arrangements urgently.\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   Search for flights, hotels, cars, packages, and activities.\n    *   User account management (profiles, saved trips, loyalty programs).\n    *   Booking and payment processing.\n    *   Customer support.\n*   **Risk Assessment (initial):**\n    *   Payment processing failures are critical.\n    *   Search functionality errors leading to lost bookings.\n    *   Website outages impacting all users.\n    *   Inaccurate pricing or availability information.\n\n**3. Test Scope**\n\nThis smoke test will cover the following:\n\n*   Website availability and load.\n*   Core navigation (main menu links).\n*   Homepage headline verification.\n*   Basic search functionality (presence of search button).\n\n**4. Smoke Test Suite Definition**\n\nThis suite will run against the production environment.\n\n**4.1. Test Case 1: Website Availability and Core Functionality**\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Description:** Verify the Expedia.com homepage is accessible and loads successfully.\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.expedia.com.\n    2.  Verify the page loads within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n    3.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200 (OK).\n*   **Expected Result:** The homepage loads successfully, displaying the expected content and layout, with a 200 HTTP status code.\n\n**4.2. Test Case 2: Core Navigation Links**\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the main navigation links (Flights, Hotels, Cars, Packages, Things to Do) are present and functional.\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.expedia.com.\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu.\n    3.  Verify the presence of the following links: \"Flights\", \"Hotels\", \"Cars\", \"Packages\", \"Things to Do\".\n    4.  Click on each link and verify that the corresponding page loads successfully.\n*   **Expected Result:** All main navigation links are present and lead to the correct pages.  Each linked page loads successfully.\n\n**4.3. Test Case 3: Homepage Headline Verification**\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Description:** Verify the homepage hero headline contains the expected text.\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.expedia.com.\n    2.  Locate the main hero section of the homepage.\n    3.  Verify that the hero headline contains the text: \"Your one-stop travel shop\".\n*   **Expected Result:** The hero headline on the homepage contains the exact text: \"Your one-stop travel shop\".\n\n**4.4. Test Case 4: Search Button Presence**\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-004\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the 'Search' button is present on the homepage.\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.expedia.com.\n    2.  Locate the main search form (flights, hotels, etc.).\n    3.  Verify that a button labeled \"Search\" (or a visually equivalent button with a search icon) is present within the search form.\n    4. Click the button.\n*   **Expected Result:** The \"Search\" button is present and clickable within the main search form. Clicking the button should initiate a search (even with default or empty search criteria).\n\n**5. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents**\n\nThese instructions will guide the autonomous agents in efficiently exploring and verifying key aspects of the website during smoke testing and future test suite expansion.\n\n*   **Prioritize Homepage Elements:**  Focus on mining elements within the `<header>`, `<nav>`, and main content area (`<main>`) of the homepage.  Pay special attention to:\n    *   All `<a>` (links) elements within the navigation.\n    *   The main hero section (look for `<h1>`, `<h2>`, or `div` elements with prominent text).\n    *   Search forms (identify `<form>` elements, especially those related to flights, hotels, etc.).\n    *   Buttons (`<button>`) within the search forms.\n*   **Dynamic Content:** Identify and analyze elements that are likely to contain dynamic content, such as:\n    *   Promotional banners and offers.\n    *   Featured destinations.\n    *   User reviews and ratings.\n*   **Accessibility Attributes:** Extract accessibility attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `alt` text for images) to improve test case robustness and ensure accessibility compliance.\n*   **API Endpoints:** If possible, identify API endpoints used by the website (e.g., for search suggestions, pricing, availability).  This will enable more direct and efficient testing of core functionality.  Look for XHR requests during user interactions.\n*   **Error Handling:** Monitor for error messages (e.g., 404 errors, JavaScript errors).  Log these errors for further investigation.  Specific error handling tests will be added to the regression suite.\n*   **Page Load Times:** Record page load times for each page visited.  Identify pages that load slowly and investigate potential performance bottlenecks.\n*   **Mobile Responsiveness:**  While this is a smoke test, briefly check the responsiveness of the homepage on different screen sizes.  Look for obvious layout issues.\n*   **Element Locators:**  Use robust element locators (e.g., XPath, CSS selectors) that are less likely to break due to minor website changes.  Prioritize locators based on `id` or unique attributes.\n\n**6. Test Environment**\n\n*   **Environment:** Production (https://www.expedia.com)\n*   **Browser(s):** Chrome (latest stable version) - Primary browser for smoke testing.\n*   **Operating System(s):**  Windows 10/11, macOS (latest)\n\n**7. Test Data**\n\n*   No specific test data is required for the smoke test.  The agent can use default or empty search criteria to verify the search functionality.\n\n**8. Test Execution**\n\n*   **Frequency:** After each deployment to the production environment.\n*   **Execution Method:** Automated (using autonomous agents).\n\n**9. Reporting**\n\n*   The autonomous agent will generate a report summarizing the results of the smoke test.\n*   The report will include:\n    *   Test case execution status (Pass/Fail).\n    *   Error messages (if any).\n    *   Page load times.\n    *   Screenshots of any failures.\n\n**10. Exit Criteria**\n\n*   All smoke test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n*   If any smoke test case fails, the build will be rejected, and the development team will be notified.\n\n**11. Future Considerations**\n\n*   Expand the test suite to include more comprehensive functional testing.\n*   Implement performance testing to ensure the website can handle peak loads.\n*   Add security testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n*   Incorporate accessibility testing to ensure the website is usable by people with disabilities.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for smoke testing Expedia.com. By following these guidelines, autonomous agents can effectively assess the website's health and core functionality.  The Strategic Mining Instructions will help to guide the agents in exploring the website and identifying key elements for future testing."
