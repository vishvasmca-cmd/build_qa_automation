  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: YouTube Website Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the YouTube website smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** YouTube is a critical video-sharing platform. While this is a smoke test, failure to launch the website or find key elements indicates a severe system outage.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load results in a complete loss of service, impacting millions of users and potentially causing significant reputational damage.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading of the homepage.\n        *   Identification of Login/Sign-in elements.\n        *   Identification of Signup/GetStarted/Try for Free (or similar) buttons (at least 5).\n        *   Identification of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   User authentication.\n        *   Video playback.\n        *   Search functionality.\n        *   Any functionality beyond the homepage.\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Error handling (e.g., 404 pages).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Launch and Element Identification**\n        *   **Description:** Verify the YouTube website loads successfully and key elements are present.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to `https://youtu.be`.\n            2.  Verify the page loads within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n            3.  Verify the presence of a Login/Sign-in element (button or link).\n            4.  Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons related to Signup/GetStarted/Try for Free (or similar calls to action).\n            5.  Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n            6.  Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n        *   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully, and all specified elements are present.\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for a smoke test. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.*\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   This smoke test does not require any specific test data. The focus is on the presence and accessibility of elements, not on data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the YouTube homepage. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class containing locators for all elements to be verified (Login button, Signup buttons, links, menu bars).\n        *   Implement methods within the `HomePage` class to interact with these elements (e.g., `isLoginButtonPresent()`, `getNumberOfSignupButtons()`, `areLinksPresent()`, `areMenuBarsPresent()`).\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential timing issues during page load. This will prevent false failures due to elements not being immediately available. For example, poll for the presence of the Login button for up to 3 seconds before failing the test.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to verify their presence.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n\n    *   **Primary Target:** `https://youtu.be` (Homepage)\n    *   **Focus:** Identify and locate the specified elements (Login, Signup buttons, links, menu bars).\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code returned for the homepage.\n        *   The page title contains \"YouTube\".\n        *   The Login/Sign-in element is present and visible.\n        *   At least 5 Signup/GetStarted/Try for Free (or similar) buttons are present and visible.\n        *   At least 2 links are present and visible.\n        *   At least 2 menu bars are present and visible.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   HTTP error code (e.g., 404, 500).\n        *   Page fails to load within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        *   Any of the required elements are missing or not visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing the YouTube website smoke test. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the test is effective in identifying critical issues and maintaining the quality of the application."
