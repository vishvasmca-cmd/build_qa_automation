  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan for Disney+, designed to guide autonomous agents in performing effective smoke tests before any automated scripts are written.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Disney+ - Smoke Test\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the test plan for conducting smoke tests on the Disney+ website (https://www.disneyplus.com). The primary goal is to ensure the core functionality of the site is operational and that critical user flows are not broken.  This test plan is designed to be executed by autonomous agents, requiring clear and detailed instructions.\n\n**2. Domain Information & Analysis**\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.disneyplus.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Entertainment (Streaming Service)\n*   **Purpose:** Disney+ is a subscription-based video streaming service owned by The Walt Disney Company.  It distributes films and television series produced by The Walt Disney Studios and Walt Disney Television.\n*   **Key User Actions:**\n    *   Browsing content (movies, series, originals).\n    *   Searching for specific titles.\n    *   Signing up for a subscription.\n    *   Logging in and out.\n    *   Managing account settings.\n    *   Watching videos.\n*   **Testing Focus:** Initial smoke tests will concentrate on the core user flows: website availability, navigation, and account creation initiation.\n\n**3. Scope**\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Website availability and load time.\n    *   Homepage elements and functionality.\n    *   Core navigation links.\n    *   \"Sign Up Now\" button functionality.\n    *   Verifying presence of key UI elements.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Video playback quality and performance.\n    *   Detailed content browsing and search functionality.\n    *   Subscription payment process.\n    *   Account management features.\n    *   Cross-browser/device compatibility.\n    *   Accessibility testing.\n    *   Detailed error handling.\n\n**4. Smoke Test Suite Definition**\n\nThe smoke test suite will consist of the following test cases:\n\n**4.1 Test Case 1: Website Availability**\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the Disney+ website is accessible and loads within an acceptable timeframe.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.disneyplus.com.\n    2.  Verify that the page loads successfully within 5 seconds.\n*   **Expected Result:** The Disney+ homepage loads completely within 5 seconds with no server errors (e.g., 500, 502, 503 errors).\n\n**4.2 Test Case 2: Core Navigation**\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the core navigation links on the homepage are functional.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.disneyplus.com.\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu (likely in the header).\n    3.  Identify the following links: \"Home\", \"Search\", \"Movies\", \"Series\", \"Originals\", and \"Account\" (or similar).  If the user is not logged in, \"Account\" may be \"Login\".\n    4.  Click each link and verify that it navigates to the expected page.\n*   **Expected Result:** Each navigation link successfully redirects to the corresponding page without errors.  Page content should be relevant to the link clicked.\n\n**4.3 Test Case 3: Hero Headline Verification**\n\n*   **Description:** Validate that the hero headline on the homepage displays the correct text.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.disneyplus.com.\n    2.  Locate the main hero section of the homepage.\n    3.  Identify the main headline text element (likely an `<h1>` or `<h2>` tag).\n    4.  Verify that the headline text contains the phrase: \"The best stories in one place\".\n*   **Expected Result:** The hero headline on the homepage contains the specified text: \"The best stories in one place\".\n\n**4.4 Test Case 4: Sign Up Flow Initiation**\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the \"Sign Up Now\" button is present and navigates the user to the sign-up page.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.disneyplus.com.\n    2.  Locate the \"Sign Up Now\" button (likely near the hero section or in the header/footer).  The exact text may vary (e.g., \"Get Disney+\", \"Start Streaming\").\n    3.  Click the \"Sign Up Now\" button.\n    4.  Verify that the page redirects to a signup page, identifiable by the presence of signup forms or related content.\n*   **Expected Result:** Clicking the \"Sign Up Now\" button redirects the user to the signup page with relevant signup elements.\n\n**5. Strategic Mining Instructions**\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize mining the following elements and pages for future, more in-depth testing:\n\n*   **Homepage:**\n    *   All navigation links and their target URLs.\n    *   All promotional banners and their target URLs.\n    *   The carousel of featured content (if present) and its functionality.\n    *   The different content categories displayed (e.g., \"Recommended for You\", \"Trending\").\n*   **Search Page:**\n    *   Search input field.\n    *   Search suggestion list.\n    *   Search result display.\n*   **Content Pages (Movie/Series):**\n    *   Title.\n    *   Description.\n    *   Cast and crew information.\n    *   \"Watch Now\" button.\n    *   \"Add to Watchlist\" button.\n*   **Signup Page:**\n    *   Input fields.\n    *   Buttons.\n    *   Error Messages.\n    *   Links to T&C and privacy policy.\n*   **Login Page:**\n    *   Input fields.\n    *   Buttons.\n    *   Error Messages.\n\n**Mining Prioritization:**\n\n1.  **Critical:** Homepage elements (navigation, hero, signup button).\n2.  **High:** Content pages (title, description, watch now button).\n3.  **Medium:** Search page.\n4.  **Low:** Login/Signup pages (focus on basic input field identification for now).\n\n**Specific Mining Instructions:**\n\n*   **Data Attributes:** Pay close attention to `data-*` attributes on elements, as these are often used for tracking and analytics and can provide valuable information for testing.\n*   **ARIA Attributes:** Examine ARIA attributes for accessibility testing potential.\n*   **Dynamic Content:** Identify elements that load dynamically (e.g., via AJAX) and note their loading triggers.\n\n**6. Test Environment**\n\n*   **Environment:** Production (https://www.disneyplus.com) -  Smoke tests are often performed on production to ensure the live site is functional.\n\n**7. Entry and Exit Criteria**\n\n*   **Entry Criteria:**\n    *   The Disney+ website is deployed and accessible.\n*   **Exit Criteria:**\n    *   All smoke test cases have been executed.\n    *   All critical defects identified during smoke testing have been resolved.\n    *   The build is deemed stable enough to proceed with further testing.\n\n**8. Reporting**\n\n*   The autonomous agent should generate a report detailing the results of each test case, including:\n    *   Test case ID and description.\n    *   Pass/Fail status.\n    *   Any errors encountered (e.g., HTTP status codes, JavaScript errors).\n    *   Screenshots of failures (if possible).\n    *   Execution time for each test case.\n\n**9. Future Considerations**\n\n*   Expand the test suite to include more comprehensive functional testing.\n*   Implement automated regression testing to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.\n*   Incorporate performance testing to monitor website load times and responsiveness.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a starting point for autonomous agent-driven testing of Disney+. By focusing on core functionality and providing clear instructions, we can quickly identify and address critical issues, ensuring a positive user experience."
