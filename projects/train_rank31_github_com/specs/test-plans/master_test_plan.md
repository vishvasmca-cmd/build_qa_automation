# Test Plan for train_rank31_github_com

## Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the train_rank31_github_com project, focusing on testing the core functionality of the GitHub website. The plan includes both smoke and regression test suites to ensure the quality and stability of the application.

## Test Scope

The testing will cover the following areas:

*   Website navigation and basic UI elements.
*   Identification of buttons and links on the homepage.

## Test Strategy

The test strategy includes two main suites: Smoke and Regression.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite will focus on verifying the most critical functionalities of the application. The following 8-point checklist has been applied to define the scope of the smoke suite:

1.  **Critical Paths:** Tests will cover the main navigation paths.
2.  **Core Business Logic:** Tests will verify the presence of key UI elements like buttons and links.
3.  **No Negative Testing:** The smoke suite will not include negative test cases.
4.  **No Complex Edge Cases:** The smoke suite will avoid complex scenarios.
5.  **Happy Path Focus:** Tests will focus on the happy path scenarios.
6.  **Fast Execution:** The smoke suite will be designed for quick execution.
7.  **Build Validation:** The smoke suite will be used to validate new builds.
8.  **Limited Scope:** The smoke suite will cover a minimal set of functionalities.

### Regression Suite Strategy

The regression suite will cover a broader range of functionalities, including alternative flows, negative scenarios, and edge cases. This suite will ensure that new changes do not introduce regressions in existing functionalities.

## Test Environment

The tests will be executed in a standard web browser environment (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Test Deliverables

*   Test Plan Document
*   Gherkin Feature Files
*   Test Execution Reports

## Test Schedule

The testing will be conducted according to the project timeline.
