  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: GitHub Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** GitHub is a critical platform for software development and collaboration. Its availability and core functionality are paramount for developers and organizations relying on it for version control, code hosting, and project management.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure of core GitHub functionality (e.g., website availability, login) can lead to:\n    *   **Productivity Loss:** Developers unable to access repositories or collaborate.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception of GitHub's reliability.\n    *   **Business Disruption:** Impact on software development workflows and release cycles.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic rendering.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements on the homepage (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu bars (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation (e.g., precise positioning, color schemes).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health and accessibility of the GitHub homepage.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the GitHub homepage (https://github.com) loads successfully.\n    2.  **Element Presence:** Confirm the presence of the following elements on the homepage:\n        *   Login button\n        *   Signup/Get Started button (or equivalent)\n        *   \"Try for Free\" button (or equivalent)\n        *   Two additional buttons (any prominent buttons on the homepage)\n        *   Two links (any prominent links on the homepage)\n        *   Two menu bars (navigation menus)\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined separately.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No test data is required for this smoke test, as it only verifies the presence of elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the GitHub homepage as a `HomePage` class. This class will contain locators for the elements to be verified (buttons, links, menu bars).\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        class HomePage:\n            def __init__(self, driver):\n                self.driver = driver\n                self.login_button = (By.XPATH, \"//a[contains(text(),'Sign in')]\") # Example Locator\n                # ... other locators\n\n            def is_login_button_present(self):\n                return self.driver.find_element(*self.login_button).is_displayed()\n        ```\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays. This will prevent false failures due to elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\n        from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n\n        WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located(HomePage.login_button))\n        ```\n    *   **Locator Strategy:** Prioritize robust locators (e.g., ID, XPath with stable attributes) to minimize the impact of UI changes. Avoid fragile locators like text-based XPath that are prone to breaking.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** GitHub Homepage (https://github.com)\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Availability:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) is returned when accessing the homepage.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Each specified button, link, and menu bar is present and visible on the page.  Use `is_displayed()` method in Selenium to verify visibility.\n    *   **No Exceptions:** The test execution should not encounter any unhandled exceptions (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`).\n*   **Success Definition:** All verification criteria are met without errors.\n*   **Failure Definition:** Any of the verification criteria are not met (e.g., website unavailable, element missing, exception encountered).  A failed smoke test indicates a critical issue that requires immediate investigation."
