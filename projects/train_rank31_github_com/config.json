  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: GitHub Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** GitHub is a critical platform for software development and collaboration. Its availability and core functionality are paramount for developers and organizations relying on it.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core GitHub functionality (e.g., website availability, login) can lead to significant disruption for developers, impacting productivity, project timelines, and potentially causing financial losses for organizations. Data breaches or security vulnerabilities could severely damage GitHub's reputation and user trust.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key elements on the homepage (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of any button, link, or menu item.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a single primary browser).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n        *   Error handling or negative scenarios.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the GitHub website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Availability:** Navigate to `https://github.com` and verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements on the homepage:\n            *   Login button/link\n            *   Signup/Get Started button/link\n            *   Try for Free button/link (or equivalent call to action)\n            *   Two additional buttons/links (any prominent calls to action)\n            *   Two menu bars (e.g., \"Product\", \"Solutions\", \"Open Source\", etc.)\n    *   **Data Strategy:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The test focuses on element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this SMOKE test strategy)\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the GitHub homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class containing locators for all the elements listed in the \"Test Cases\" above.\n        *   Create methods within the `HomePage` class to verify the presence of these elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential delays in element loading. This will reduce flakiness caused by timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to be present before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed assertions, especially for element presence checks.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** `https://github.com` (GitHub Homepage)\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Availability:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"GitHub\"\n    2.  **Element Identification:**\n        *   Login Button/Link: Element is present and visible.\n        *   Signup/Get Started Button/Link: Element is present and visible.\n        *   Try for Free Button/Link (or equivalent): Element is present and visible.\n        *   Two Additional Buttons/Links: Elements are present and visible.\n        *   Two Menu Bars: Elements are present and visible.\n*   **Success Definition:** All verification criteria are met. If any criterion fails, the smoke test fails, and the build should be rejected."
