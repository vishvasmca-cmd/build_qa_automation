  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: GitHub Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** GitHub is a critical platform for software development and collaboration. Its availability and core functionality are paramount for developers and organizations relying on it for version control, code hosting, and project management.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core GitHub functionalities (e.g., website availability, login, signup) can lead to:\n    *   **Developer Productivity Loss:** Inability to access repositories, commit code, or collaborate.\n    *   **Project Delays:** Hindrance in software development timelines.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Erosion of trust in GitHub's reliability.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and load time.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key UI elements on the homepage (buttons, links, menu bars) without interaction.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu items (no clicks).\n        *   Login/Signup processes (covered in separate regression tests).\n        *   Code repository functionality.\n        *   Performance testing beyond initial load time.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the GitHub homepage is accessible and essential UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the GitHub homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Button Presence:** Verify the presence of at least five of the following buttons: \"Sign up\", \"Get Started\", \"Try for Free\", \"Pricing\", \"Explore\".\n        3.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of at least two links on the homepage.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of at least two menu bars (e.g., \"Product\", \"Solutions\", \"Open Source\", \"Pricing\").\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the GitHub homepage as a page object. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   Example: `HomePage.java` (or equivalent in your chosen language) containing methods to verify the presence of buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues during page load. This will prevent false failures due to elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Example:** Wait for a specific button to be present on the page before asserting its existence.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **GitHub Homepage (https://github.com):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Availability:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Button Presence:** The specified buttons are present and visible on the page.\n    *   **Link Presence:** The specified links are present and visible on the page.\n    *   **Menu Bar Presence:** The specified menu bars are present and visible on the page.\n*   **Success Definition:** All verification criteria are met. If any criterion fails, the smoke test fails, and the build should be rejected."
