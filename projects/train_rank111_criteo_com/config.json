  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Criteo.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nCriteo.com is a website for an advertising platform. Its primary function is to provide information about Criteo's services and solutions to potential clients and partners. The website also serves as a portal for existing clients to access their accounts and manage their campaigns.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nA failure of the Criteo.com website can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of potential leads and clients:** If the website is inaccessible or malfunctioning, potential clients may be unable to learn about Criteo's offerings and may choose a competitor instead.\n*   **Damage to brand reputation:** A poorly functioning website can create a negative impression of Criteo and erode trust in the company.\n*   **Disruption of existing client services:** If clients are unable to access their accounts or manage their campaigns, it can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction.\n\nGiven these risks, the website's core functionalities (accessibility, navigation, key information display) are considered **P0 (Priority 0)**.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Website accessibility (HTTP 200 status)\n*   Loading of the homepage and key landing pages.\n*   Presence and basic functionality of key UI elements:\n    *   Login button/link\n    *   Signup/Get Started button/link\n    *   \"Try for Free\" or similar call-to-action button/link\n    *   5 other prominent buttons/links on the homepage\n    *   2 menu bars (verify presence, not functionality)\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed functionality of any button or link (e.g., clicking through the signup process).\n*   Performance testing (load times, etc.)\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (beyond a single, representative browser).\n*   Mobile responsiveness testing.\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Error handling (e.g., 404 pages).\n*   Any functionality behind a login.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will verify the absolute minimum functionality required for the website to be considered \"up\" and running.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Homepage Accessibility**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the homepage is accessible and returns an HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://criteo.com`.\n        2.  Verify that the HTTP status code is 200.\n    *   **Expected Result:** HTTP status code 200.\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Key Element Presence**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the presence of critical UI elements on the homepage.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://criteo.com`.\n        2.  Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n        3.  Verify the presence of a \"Signup/Get Started\" button/link.\n        4.  Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" (or similar) button/link.\n        5.  Verify the presence of 5 other prominent buttons/links.\n        6.  Verify the presence of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Expected Result:** All specified elements are present on the page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (N/A - Smoke Test Only)\n\nThis is a smoke test strategy, so a full regression suite is not defined at this stage.  A regression suite would be defined later, focusing on the functionality behind the buttons and links identified in the smoke test.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nSince this is a smoke test focused on UI element presence, no specific test data is required.  The tests will operate on the live website.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nWhile a full-fledged framework isn't strictly necessary for this minimal smoke test, adopting a basic **Page Object Model (POM)** structure is recommended for future scalability.\n\n*   Create a `HomePage` class that encapsulates the locators for the key UI elements (Login button, Signup button, etc.).\n*   The test cases will interact with the `HomePage` class to find and verify the presence of these elements.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\nGiven the potential for website flakiness, the following resilience strategies should be considered:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Instead of immediately failing if an element is not found, use a polling assertion (e.g., wait up to 5 seconds for the element to appear).\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** If a test fails due to a transient error (e.g., network timeout), retry the test a limited number of times.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should focus its exploration on the following:\n\n*   **Homepage (`https://criteo.com`)**: This is the primary target for identifying the key UI elements.\n*   **Header and Footer**: These areas are likely to contain the \"Login,\" \"Signup,\" and other important links.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   The homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 status).\n    *   All specified UI elements (Login, Signup, Try for Free, 5 other buttons/links, 2 menu bars) are present on the homepage.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   The homepage fails to load (HTTP status code other than 200).\n    *   Any of the specified UI elements are missing from the homepage."
