  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Criteo.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Criteo.com smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the website.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Criteo.com is a website for an advertising platform. Its core business revolves around providing advertising solutions to businesses. Website availability and core navigation are critical for potential clients to learn about Criteo's offerings and engage with the company.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or critical navigation elements to function can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of potential leads:** New customers may be unable to explore Criteo's services.\n    *   **Damage to brand reputation:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the company's reliability.\n    *   **Reduced engagement:** Existing clients may find it difficult to access information or support.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading of the homepage.\n        *   Identification of key navigation elements (menu bars, buttons, links).\n        *   Verification of the presence of \"Login,\" \"Signup/Get Started,\" \"Try for Free\" (or similar) buttons.\n        *   Verification of the presence of at least two menu bars.\n        *   Verification of the presence of at least two links.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed functionality of any specific feature or service.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness testing (initially, focus on desktop).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Accessibility testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core navigation elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Homepage Load:** Navigate to `https://criteo.com` and verify the page loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button (or similar, e.g., \"Sign In\").\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar button.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" button (or similar).\n        5.  **Button Count:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons.\n        6.  **Link Count:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Count:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on verifying the presence of elements, not their functionality with specific data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Criteo.com homepage. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class that encapsulates the locators and interactions for elements on the homepage (e.g., login button, signup button, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays. This will prevent false failures due to elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to be present and visible before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial page load in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://criteo.com`):** Focus on identifying the key navigation elements (buttons, links, menu bars) on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage Load:** HTTP status code 200 and the presence of the main page content (e.g., the Criteo logo, a prominent headline).\n    *   **Button/Link/Menu Bar Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present in the DOM and visible on the page.  Use appropriate locators (e.g., XPath, CSS selectors) to identify these elements.\n    *   **Element Text:** Verify that the text of the identified buttons matches the expected values (e.g., \"Login,\" \"Sign Up,\" \"Try for Free\")."
