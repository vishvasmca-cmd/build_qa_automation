  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Live.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the smoke test suite for Live.com. This strategy is designed to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational and stable before further testing and development efforts are invested.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Live.com is a general web portal, likely offering a variety of services such as email, news, search, and other online tools. The criticality of each service varies, but the overall availability and basic functionality of the website are crucial for user experience and brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or core functionalities to operate can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of User Trust:** Users may switch to alternative services if Live.com is unreliable.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception of the brand due to website outages.\n    *   **Potential Loss of Revenue:** If Live.com integrates with revenue-generating services (e.g., advertising, subscriptions), outages can directly impact revenue.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading in a standard web browser.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of the Login button/link.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of Signup/GetStarted/Try for Free (or similar) buttons/links (at least 5).\n        *   Presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of any links or buttons (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed testing of individual services offered through Live.com.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (beyond a single standard browser).\n        *   Mobile device testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Launch and Basic Elements**\n        *   **Description:** Verify the Live.com website loads successfully and displays key elements.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Open a web browser and navigate to `https://live.com`.\n            2.  Verify the page loads within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n            3.  Verify the presence of the website logo or branding.\n            4.  Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons/links related to Login, Signup/GetStarted/Try for Free (or similar).\n            5.  Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n            6.  Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n        *   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully, the logo is visible, and all required buttons/links and menu bars are present.\n*   **Regression Suite:**  *Not applicable for a smoke test strategy.*  Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The test focuses on the presence and accessibility of elements, not on data input or processing.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** While this is a smoke test and doesn't require a full-fledged framework, consider using a lightweight framework like Selenium or Playwright for ease of element identification and assertion. A simple Page Object Model (POM) structure can be beneficial even for this limited scope.\n    *   **Page Object:** `HomePage` - Contains locators for the logo, Login button/link, Signup/GetStarted/Try for Free buttons/links, other links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_for_element_to_be_present`) to handle potential timing issues during page load. This helps avoid false failures due to elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial page load in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://live.com`):** This is the primary target for verifying website launch and the presence of key elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200 (OK) is returned when accessing `https://live.com`.\n        *   The website logo or branding is visible.\n        *   At least 5 buttons/links related to Login, Signup/GetStarted/Try for Free (or similar) are present and visible.\n        *   At least 2 links are present and visible on the homepage.\n        *   At least 2 menu bars are present and visible on the homepage.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   HTTP status code other than 200 is returned.\n        *   The website fails to load within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        *   The website logo is not visible.\n        *   Any of the required buttons/links or menu bars are missing or not visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing the smoke test suite for Live.com. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the core functionality of the website is verified before further testing and development efforts are invested."
