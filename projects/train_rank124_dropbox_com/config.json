  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Dropbox.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the Dropbox.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Dropbox is a critical file hosting and collaboration platform. Downtime or critical functionality failure can lead to significant user disruption, data inaccessibility, and reputational damage.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Data loss, account access issues, inability to share files, security vulnerabilities.\n    *   **Impact:** Financial loss (premium subscriptions), user trust erosion, legal ramifications (data breaches).\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key UI elements on the homepage: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, and any other 2 prominent buttons.\n        *   Presence of 2 prominent links on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Navigation to other pages beyond the initial homepage load.\n        *   Form submission or data input.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of specific features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the Dropbox.com website is accessible and the core UI elements are present and visible.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Dropbox.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify the 4th prominent button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify the 5th prominent button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify the 1st prominent link is present and visible on the homepage.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify the 2nd prominent link is present and visible on the homepage.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify the 1st menu bar is present and visible on the homepage.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify the 2nd menu bar is present and visible on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.*  A comprehensive regression suite will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   While a full-fledged Page Object Model (POM) might be overkill for this *minimal* smoke test, consider a simplified approach.  Create a `HomePage` class that encapsulates the locators for the key UI elements (Login button, Signup button, etc.). This will facilitate maintainability if the UI changes.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:**  Use short polling assertions (e.g., retry every 500ms for 2 seconds) to check for element presence. This helps mitigate transient loading issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:**  Implement explicit waits (WebDriverWait) to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Dropbox.com Homepage:** The primary focus is on the initial page load and the presence of key UI elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code AND the page title contains \"Dropbox\".\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the page (i.e., `element.isDisplayed()` returns `true`).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   A clear \"Pass/Fail\" status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for any failures, including screenshots.\n    *   Execution time for the entire smoke suite.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Dropbox.com website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that critical functionality is verified quickly and efficiently, minimizing the risk of deploying broken builds."
