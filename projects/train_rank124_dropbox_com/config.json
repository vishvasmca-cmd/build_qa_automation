  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Dropbox.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Dropbox.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** Dropbox is a file hosting service that provides cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software. Its business criticality lies in data accessibility, security, and reliability. Failure in these areas can lead to data loss, security breaches, and significant reputational damage.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** A failure of core functionality (e.g., login, signup) directly impacts user access and trust. A data breach would be catastrophic.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Existence and accessibility of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of HTTP status codes for initial page load.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functional testing of individual features.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and the essential UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to `https://dropbox.com`. Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Element Check:** Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present and visible on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Check:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link is present and visible on the page.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element Check:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button/link is present and visible on the page.\n        5.  **Button Count Check:** Verify at least 5 buttons are present on the page.\n        6.  **Link Count Check:** Verify at least 2 links are present on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Count Check:** Verify at least 2 menu bars are present on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   For this smoke test, no specific test data is required. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke tests. Consider using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   **Page Objects:** Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators for the \"Login,\" \"Signup,\" \"Try for Free\" buttons/links, and methods to check their presence.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) to handle potential loading delays.  Implement a reasonable timeout (e.g., 5 seconds).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial page load in case of temporary network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://dropbox.com`):** This is the primary target for element discovery.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons/links/menu bars are present and visible on the page.  Visibility should be determined by checking the element's `offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight` properties (should be greater than 0).\n    *   **Button/Link/Menu Bar Count:** The number of buttons, links, and menu bars on the page should be greater than or equal to the specified minimums (5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   A clear pass/fail report should be generated after each smoke test execution.\n    *   Failures should include detailed error messages and screenshots.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Dropbox.com website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality of the application is consistently verified, minimizing the risk of critical failures."
