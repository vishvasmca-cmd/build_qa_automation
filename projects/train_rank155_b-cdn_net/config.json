  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: b-cdn.net - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the b-cdn.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** b-cdn.net appears to be a website offering CDN (Content Delivery Network) services. Business criticality revolves around website availability, accurate information display, and functional lead generation (sign-up, free trials).\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of potential customers:** Inability to sign up or learn about the service.\n    *   **Damage to brand reputation:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the company.\n    *   **Loss of existing customers:** If the website is used for account management or support.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page loading.\n        *   Identification of key interactive elements (buttons, links, menus).\n        *   Verification of the presence of critical elements (logo, navigation).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of the CDN service itself.\n        *   Performance testing (load times, etc.).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility beyond a single, primary browser (e.g., Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Clicking and navigating through the identified elements.\n        *   Form submission or data validation.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health and accessibility of the b-cdn.net website.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Launch and Basic Page Load**\n        *   **Description:** Verify the website loads successfully in a browser.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to `https://b-cdn.net`.\n        *   **Expected Result:** The website homepage loads without errors.\n    *   **Test Case 2: Key Element Identification**\n        *   **Description:** Verify the presence of critical interactive elements on the homepage.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to `https://b-cdn.net`.\n            2.  Identify the following elements:\n                *   At least 5 buttons (e.g., Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free).\n                *   At least 2 links.\n                *   At least 2 menu bars.\n        *   **Expected Result:** All specified elements are present and visible on the page.\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this initial smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in subsequent phases.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on verifying the presence and accessibility of elements, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   While a full-fledged framework might be overkill for this initial smoke test, consider using a lightweight assertion library (e.g., `pytest` with `requests` in Python, or `Chai` with `Selenium` in JavaScript) to simplify verification.\n    *   For future regression testing, a Page Object Model (POM) structure is highly recommended. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Given the potential for network latency, implement polling assertions to allow elements to load before failing the test. For example, wait for a button to be present for a short period (e.g., 5 seconds) before asserting its existence.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and log meaningful error messages.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage (`/`):** This is the primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200 (OK).\n        *   No browser console errors.\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   The specified number of buttons, links, and menu bars are present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n        *   Elements are visible on the page (not hidden by CSS).\n        *   Element text matches expected values (e.g., button text says \"Login\").\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for smoke testing the b-cdn.net website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the website's core functionality is validated effectively and efficiently."
