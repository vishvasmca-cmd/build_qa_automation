  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Gandi.net Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Gandi.net smoke test suite. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the website.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Gandi.net is a domain registrar and web hosting provider. The core business revolves around domain registration, DNS management, and related services. Website availability and basic functionality are critical for customer acquisition and retention.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or critical elements to function (e.g., login, signup) can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of potential customers:** New users unable to sign up.\n    *   **Damage to brand reputation:** Website unavailability reflects poorly on Gandi.net's reliability.\n    *   **Loss of revenue:** Existing customers unable to manage their domains or services.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any elements (buttons, links, menu items).\n        *   Form submission or data input.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to `https://gandi.net`. Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n        2.  **Login Element Check:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Check:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element Check:** Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" button/link (or similar call to action).\n        5.  **Button Count Check:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons on the page.\n        6.  **Link Count Check:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Count Check:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for this smoke test strategy.* A full regression suite would be defined separately.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** While this is a simple smoke test, adopting a POM structure from the beginning will facilitate future expansion into a full regression suite. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the selectors for the elements being verified.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible`) to handle potential delays in element loading. This helps mitigate flakiness due to network latency or asynchronous rendering.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire test suite. If the smoke test fails, retry it once or twice before marking the build as failed. This can help address transient issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`/`):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"Gandi.net\" (or a similar relevant title).\n    *   **Element Presence:**\n        *   Elements are present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n        *   Elements are visible on the page.\n        *   Elements are enabled (not disabled or grayed out).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots or videos of failed tests to aid in debugging.\n*   **Automation Priority:** Automate this smoke test suite immediately and integrate it into the CI/CD pipeline.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for ensuring the basic health and availability of the Gandi.net website. It is a living document and should be reviewed and updated as the application evolves."
