  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ExpandTesting.com - Web Inputs\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the \"Web Inputs\" functionality on the ExpandTesting.com platform. It serves as a blueprint for all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage, efficient execution, and a robust testing framework. This strategy prioritizes risk mitigation and focuses on delivering a high-quality user experience.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** This site serves as a practice platform. While not a live production environment, failures can still impact user learning and perception of the platform's reliability. The \"Web Inputs\" functionality is key to demonstrating form handling capabilities.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the \"Web Inputs\" functionality can lead to:\n    *   **Reduced User Engagement:** Frustration due to broken forms.\n    *   **Inaccurate Learning:** Incorrect validation or processing of inputs.\n    *   **Loss of Credibility:** Reduced trust in the platform's quality.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All input fields (text, numbers, email, etc.) on the \"Web Inputs\" page.\n        *   Validation logic for each input field (required fields, data type checks, format checks).\n        *   Submission and processing of the form data.\n        *   Error handling and display of error messages.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).\n        *   Responsiveness on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Third-party integrations (unless explicitly used for input validation).\n        *   Performance testing (beyond basic load time).\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) \u2013 although basic checks for ARIA attributes on inputs should be considered.\n        *   Database interactions (assuming no database is used for this specific practice form).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n\n    *   **Purpose:** Verify the core functionality of the \"Web Inputs\" page.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  Navigate to the \"Web Inputs\" page successfully.\n        2.  Enter valid data in all required fields.\n        3.  Submit the form successfully.\n        4.  Verify a success message is displayed (if applicable).\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**:\n\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   **Invalid Inputs:**\n            *   Enter invalid characters in number fields (e.g., letters).\n            *   Enter invalid email addresses (e.g., missing \"@\" or \".\").\n            *   Enter values exceeding maximum allowed lengths.\n            *   Attempt SQL injection attacks (e.g., `'; DROP TABLE users; --`).\n            *   Attempt Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).\n        *   **Boundary Values:**\n            *   Enter minimum and maximum allowed values in numerical fields.\n            *   Enter strings with minimum and maximum allowed lengths.\n        *   **Required Fields:**\n            *   Submit the form without filling in required fields.\n            *   Verify appropriate error messages are displayed for each missing field.\n        *   **Timeouts:**\n            * Simulate slow network conditions and verify form submission still yields an informative error message.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   **Empty States:** Test behavior when all input fields are empty.\n        *   **Concurrency:** Simulate multiple users submitting the form simultaneously (if applicable).\n        *   **Network Failures:** Simulate network interruptions during form submission.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   **OWASP Top 10 Basics:** As noted in Negative Testing, focus on input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n    *   **Validation Messages:**\n        *   Verify that all validation messages are clear, concise, and informative.\n        *   Verify that validation messages are displayed in the correct location and format.\n        *   Verify that validation messages disappear when the input is corrected.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Test Data:** Primarily dynamic generation using a library like Faker.js or similar.  This allows for a wide range of input values and reduces the risk of data collisions.\n    *   **Data Storage:**  No explicit data storage is needed; data is used transiently for each test case.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Essential for maintainability and code reusability. Create separate page objects for the \"Web Inputs\" page, encapsulating elements and actions.\n    *   **Example Structure:**\n        *   `pages/WebInputsPage.js` (contains selectors and methods for interacting with the Web Inputs form)\n        *   `tests/WebInputs.spec.js` (contains test cases that use the WebInputsPage object)\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Flakiness Mitigation:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions (Retry Mechanism):** Use libraries like `expect-webdriverio` or implement custom retry logic to handle transient issues (e.g., elements not immediately visible).\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Use `WebDriverWait` to wait for elements to be in a specific state (e.g., visible, clickable) before interacting with them.  Avoid implicit waits, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n        *   **Implement Self-Healing:** Consider tools like Selenium IDE for element locators.\n    *   **Element Locators:**\n        *   Prioritize robust locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `data-qa`) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n        *   Use CSS selectors whenever possible for better performance and readability.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n\n    1.  **`https://practice.expandtesting.com/`**: Root URL for quick health check.\n    2.  **`https://practice.expandtesting.com/inputs`**: Directly target the \"Web Inputs\" page.  This is the primary focus for exploration.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    *   **Navigation:**  Verify that navigating to the \"Web Inputs\" page results in an HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Form Display:** Verify that all expected input fields are displayed on the page (check for presence of elements).\n    *   **Validation:** Verify that submitting the form with valid data (smoke test) results in either a success message or a redirect to another page with a successful state.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Verify that submitting the form with invalid data results in appropriate error messages being displayed next to the incorrect fields.\n    *   **Field Types**: Verify each field accepts the correct datatype\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving requirements of the ExpandTesting.com platform."
