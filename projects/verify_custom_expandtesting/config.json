  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ExpandTesting.com - Web Inputs Form Navigation\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the ExpandTesting.com website, specifically focusing on the \"Web Inputs\" form navigation and data entry. This strategy will guide all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and high-quality delivery.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The ExpandTesting.com website appears to be a practice/demonstration site for testing concepts. While not a live production system, failures can impact user learning and perception of ExpandTesting's capabilities. The \"Web Inputs\" form is a core component for demonstrating input validation and form handling.\n\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **Low Financial Risk:** No direct financial transactions are involved.\n    *   **Low Data Breach Risk:** Likely no sensitive user data is stored.\n    *   **Medium Trust Loss Risk:** Failures in form handling or navigation can lead to a negative user experience and damage the perception of ExpandTesting's expertise. Incorrect validation messages or broken form submissions are key areas of concern.\n\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Navigation to the \"Web Inputs\" form page.\n        *   All input fields on the \"Web Inputs\" form (text, number, email, etc.).\n        *   Form submission and validation.\n        *   Error handling for invalid inputs.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions).\n        *   Basic accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for form elements).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (beyond basic page load times).\n        *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n        *   Mobile device testing (unless explicitly requested).\n        *   API testing (unless the form submission triggers an API call).\n        *   Testing of other pages/functionality on the ExpandTesting.com website outside of the \"Web Inputs\" form.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify basic navigation and form loading.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  Navigate to the ExpandTesting.com homepage.\n        2.  Click the link/button to access the \"Web Inputs\" form page.\n        3.  Verify the \"Web Inputs\" form page loads successfully (title is correct, form elements are present).\n    *   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All steps must pass. Failure indicates a critical issue preventing further testing.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   **Invalid Inputs:** Test each input field with invalid data types (e.g., text in a number field, invalid email format).\n        *   **Boundary Values:** Test numerical fields with minimum, maximum, and out-of-range values.\n        *   **Missing Required Fields:** Submit the form with required fields left blank.\n        *   **Special Characters:** Test input fields with special characters (e.g., <, >, \", ', \\, /, etc.) to check for XSS vulnerabilities.\n        *   **Long Strings:** Test input fields with excessively long strings to check for buffer overflows or truncation issues.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   **Concurrency:** (If applicable) Simulate multiple users submitting the form simultaneously.\n        *   **Network Failures:** Simulate network interruptions during form submission.\n        *   **Empty States:** Verify the form handles empty input fields gracefully.\n        *   **JavaScript Disabled:** Test the form with JavaScript disabled to ensure basic functionality remains.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   **OWASP Top 10 Basics:**\n            *   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Attempt to inject SQL code into text input fields.\n            *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attempt to inject JavaScript code into text input fields.\n            *   **Input Validation:** Ensure all input fields are properly validated to prevent malicious input.\n    *   **Validation Messages:**\n        *   Verify that appropriate and user-friendly error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n        *   Verify that error messages are displayed in the correct location on the page.\n        *   Verify that error messages disappear when the input is corrected.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Dynamic Generation:** Utilize dynamic test data generation for input fields to ensure a wide range of values are tested. This can be achieved using libraries like Faker.js or similar.\n    *   **Data Pools:** Create data pools for specific input types (e.g., valid email addresses, invalid email addresses, valid phone numbers, invalid phone numbers) to facilitate efficient testing.\n    *   **Data Masking:** If any sensitive data is used (even for testing purposes), ensure it is properly masked or anonymized.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent the \"Web Inputs\" form page as a reusable object. This will improve code maintainability and reduce code duplication.\n    *   **Language:** JavaScript with frameworks like Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium WebDriver.\n    *   **Assertion Library:** Chai, Jest, or similar.\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically retry failed actions or locate elements that have changed.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests, allowing them to be re-executed a limited number of times before failing.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **ExpandTesting.com Homepage:** To locate the link to the \"Web Inputs\" form.\n    2.  **\"Web Inputs\" Form Page:** All input fields, labels, and the submit button.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Navigation Success:** HTTP 200 status code and the correct page title are present.\n    *   **Form Element Presence:** All expected input fields, labels, and the submit button are visible and enabled.\n    *   **Form Submission Success:** (If applicable) A success message is displayed after submitting the form with valid data.\n    *   **Error Message Display:** Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n    *   **Accessibility Compliance:** Form elements meet basic WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines (e.g., proper labels, ARIA attributes).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the \"Web Inputs\" form on the ExpandTesting.com website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure thorough test coverage, high-quality delivery, and a positive user experience.\n"
