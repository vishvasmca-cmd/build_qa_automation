  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ExpandTesting.com - Web Inputs Form\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the ExpandTesting.com website, specifically focusing on the \"Web Inputs\" form functionality. This strategy will guide all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and a high-quality user experience.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The ExpandTesting.com website serves as a platform for practicing various testing techniques. While not a direct revenue generator, its reliability is crucial for maintaining user trust and attracting potential customers to ExpandTesting's services. The \"Web Inputs\" form is a core component for users to practice input validation and data handling.\n\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the \"Web Inputs\" form can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of User Trust:** Users may perceive the platform as unreliable, impacting their willingness to use it for practice or consider ExpandTesting's services.\n    *   **Inaccurate Learning:** If the form doesn't function as expected, users may learn incorrect testing techniques.\n    *   **Negative Brand Perception:** A buggy platform can damage ExpandTesting's reputation.\n\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All input fields on the \"Web Inputs\" form (text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers, etc.).\n        *   Form submission and validation logic.\n        *   Error handling and display of validation messages.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n        *   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n        *   Basic security checks (input sanitization).\n        *   Accessibility (WCAG compliance - basic checks).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress).\n        *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n        *   Integration with external systems (if any).\n        *   Detailed accessibility testing beyond basic checks.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Verify the basic functionality of the \"Web Inputs\" form.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  Navigate to the ExpandTesting.com website.\n        2.  Navigate to the \"Web Inputs\" page.\n        3.  Verify that all input fields are displayed.\n        4.  Enter valid data into all required fields.\n        5.  Submit the form.\n        6.  Verify that the form submits successfully (e.g., a success message is displayed).\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   **Invalid Inputs:** Test each input field with invalid data types (e.g., entering text in a numeric field, special characters in a name field).\n        *   **Boundary Values:** Test numeric fields with minimum and maximum allowed values, as well as values outside the allowed range.\n        *   **Missing Required Fields:** Submit the form with required fields left blank.\n        *   **Incorrect Format:** Test date fields with incorrect date formats.\n        *   **Email Validation:** Test email fields with invalid email addresses.\n        *   **Timeout Handling:** Simulate slow network connections and verify that the form handles timeouts gracefully.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   **Concurrency:** Simulate multiple users submitting the form simultaneously.\n        *   **Network Failures:** Simulate network failures during form submission.\n        *   **Empty States:** Verify that the form handles empty states correctly (e.g., no data entered).\n        *   **Long Text Fields:** Enter very long strings into text fields to check for buffer overflows or truncation issues.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   **OWASP Top 10 Basics:**\n            *   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Attempt to inject SQL code into text fields.\n            *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attempt to inject JavaScript code into text fields.\n            *   **Input Sanitization:** Verify that the application sanitizes user inputs to prevent malicious code execution.\n    *   **Alternative Flows:**\n        *   Test different combinations of input values to cover various scenarios.\n    *   **Validation Messages:**\n        *   Verify that appropriate validation messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n        *   Verify that validation messages are clear, concise, and user-friendly.\n    *   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n        *   If the \"Web Inputs\" form interacts with other modules (e.g., a database), verify that the data is correctly stored and retrieved.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Dynamic Generation:** Use dynamic test data generation for most input fields to ensure a wide range of values are tested. Libraries like Faker.js or similar can be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Use static data for specific scenarios, such as testing boundary values or specific error conditions.\n    *   **Data Storage:** Store test data in a separate file (e.g., JSON, CSV) to allow for easy modification and maintenance.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent the \"Web Inputs\" page and its elements. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   **Language:** JavaScript with Playwright or Selenium WebdriverIO.\n    *   **Assertion Library:** Chai or Jest.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to appear or for conditions to be met. This will help to reduce flakiness caused by timing issues.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors, such as element locators changing. This can be achieved using AI-powered tools or custom logic.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests to account for transient errors.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Web Inputs Page:** `https://practice.expandtesting.com/`\n    2.  **All Input Fields:** Focus on exploring all input fields on the page, including text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and date pickers.\n    3.  **Form Submission:** Explore the form submission process with different combinations of input values.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP 200 OK:** Verify that the page loads successfully with an HTTP 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that all input fields and form elements are visible on the page.\n    *   **Validation Messages:** Verify that appropriate validation messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n    *   **Form Submission Success:** Verify that the form submits successfully when valid data is entered.\n    *   **Data Persistence:** If the form data is stored in a database, verify that the data is correctly stored and retrieved.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the \"Web Inputs\" form on ExpandTesting.com. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure that the form is reliable, user-friendly, and secure. This will contribute to a positive user experience and enhance ExpandTesting's reputation as a provider of high-quality testing resources.\n"
