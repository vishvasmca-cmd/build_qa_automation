  "master_plan": "# Kaspersky.com - Master Test Strategy (Smoke Testing)\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Kaspersky.com is a cybersecurity company website. Failure can lead to loss of potential customers, damage to brand reputation, and potential security vulnerabilities being overlooked.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Medium-High. Website unavailability or critical functionality failure (e.g., inability to download trial software) directly impacts revenue and user trust.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website availability and basic rendering.\n        *   Presence of key navigation elements (menu bars).\n        *   Presence of specified buttons (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, etc.).\n        *   Presence of specified links.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Functionality of buttons and links (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic availability).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Goal**: Verify the website is up, accessible, and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Website Availability**: Verify the website loads successfully.\n        2.  **Menu Bar Presence**: Verify the main menu bar(s) are present.\n        3.  **Button Presence**: Verify the presence of at least 5 of the following buttons: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, Buy Now, Contact Us, Support.\n        4.  **Link Presence**: Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite**: Not applicable for Smoke testing.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   No specific test data is required for smoke tests, as we are only verifying the presence of elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability and scalability. Create a base `HomePage` object.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible()`) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for initial page load failures (e.g., retry up to 3 times with a 2-second delay).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  Homepage (`https://kaspersky.com`)\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    1.  **Website Availability**: HTTP status code 200.\n    2.  **Menu Bar Presence**: Menu bar element is present in the DOM.\n    3.  **Button Presence**: Specified buttons are present in the DOM.\n    4.  **Link Presence**: Specified links are present in the DOM."
