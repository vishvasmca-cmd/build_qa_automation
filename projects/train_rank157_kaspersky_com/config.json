  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Kaspersky.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for performing smoke tests on the Kaspersky.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the website's core functionality.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Kaspersky.com is a critical website for a cybersecurity company. Its availability and functionality are paramount for brand reputation, customer acquisition, and service delivery.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Inability to access security solutions erodes trust.\n    *   **Loss of Potential Customers:** Difficulty in accessing product information and trials hinders sales.\n    *   **Security Concerns:** Ironically, a down or malfunctioning security website raises security concerns.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page rendering.\n        *   Identification of key elements (buttons, links, menu bars) on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicks).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Performance testing (load times).\n        *   Accessibility testing.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid input).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health of the Kaspersky.com website.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully in a browser.\n    2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements on the homepage:\n        *   At least 5 distinct buttons (e.g., \"Login,\" \"Signup/Get Started,\" \"Try for Free,\" \"Buy Now,\" \"Contact Us\").\n        *   At least 2 distinct links (e.g., \"Privacy Policy,\" \"Terms of Use\").\n        *   At least 2 distinct menu bars (e.g., \"Products,\" \"Solutions,\" \"Support\").\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined separately.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the homepage. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n        *   `HomePage` class: Contains locators for buttons, links, and menu bars.\n        *   Methods: `isButtonPresent(buttonText)`, `isLinkPresent(linkText)`, `isMenuBarPresent(menuBarText)`.\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential delays in element loading. This will reduce flakiness. Example: Wait for a button to be present for a maximum of 5 seconds before failing the test.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Employ explicit waits with expected conditions to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to locate them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: The primary focus is on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the main page title.\n    2.  **Element Identification:**\n        *   Buttons: Verify the presence of the specified buttons using their text labels.\n        *   Links: Verify the presence of the specified links using their text labels.\n        *   Menu Bars: Verify the presence of the specified menu bars using their text labels.\n*   **Success Criteria:** All verification criteria must pass for the smoke test to be considered successful. If any criteria fail, the build should be rejected."
