  "master_plan": "Okay, let's craft a Master Test Plan for Coinbase.com, focusing on smoke testing and the specified user goal.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Coinbase.com - Smoke Test\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for smoke testing the Coinbase.com website. The primary objective is to ensure the core functionality is operational and the user can successfully complete a basic \"happy path\" scenario.  This plan will guide autonomous agents in identifying key elements, verifying their functionality, and structuring the test suite.\n\n**2. Domain Information & Analysis**\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.coinbase.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform\n*   **Goal of Website:** To provide a platform for users to buy, sell, store, and learn about cryptocurrencies. Key functions include user account management, cryptocurrency trading, and access to educational resources.\n*   **Target Audience:** Individuals and institutions interested in buying, selling, and managing cryptocurrencies. Range from beginner to advanced users.\n*   **Key Areas of Focus for Initial Testing:**\n    *   Website availability and performance.\n    *   Homepage content and navigation.\n    *   Account creation/login flow.\n    *   Core cryptocurrency trading functionalities (high-level).\n    *   Security considerations (HTTPS, privacy policy links).\n*   **Assumptions:**\n    *   The website is expected to be available 24/7 with minimal downtime.\n    *   The website is expected to handle a large volume of traffic.\n    *   Security is a paramount concern for the platform.\n    *   The User Interface will be responsive and usable across different devices.\n\n**3. Scope**\n\nThis Master Test Plan covers the smoke test suite. It focuses on critical functionalities necessary for a user to access the website, navigate the homepage, and begin the process of creating an account. It does *not* cover:\n\n*   Detailed testing of all cryptocurrency trading features.\n*   Performance testing under load.\n*   Security vulnerability testing.\n*   Detailed testing of user account management features.\n*   Testing on specific mobile devices.\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Localization testing (different languages).\n\n**4. Test Objectives**\n\n*   Verify website availability and responsiveness.\n*   Verify core navigation links are functional.\n*   Verify the presence and accuracy of the key hero headline on the homepage.\n*   Verify the presence and functionality of the \"Get Started\" button on the homepage.\n*   Confirm successful navigation to the account creation/signup page (implied by clicking \"Get Started\").\n\n**5. Smoke Test Suite Definition**\n\nThis smoke test suite should be executed after each deployment or significant change to the Coinbase.com website.\n\n*   **Test Environment:** Production (ideally, a staging environment mimicking production should be used first).\n*   **Test Data:** No specific test data is required for the smoke tests outlined below, as it primarily focuses on navigation and UI elements.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n\n    *   **TC_SMOKE_001: Website Availability**\n        *   **Description:** Verify that the Coinbase.com website is accessible and returns a 200 OK HTTP status code.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to https://www.coinbase.com.\n        *   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully without errors. HTTP status code 200 OK is returned.\n\n    *   **TC_SMOKE_002: Core Navigation Links**\n        *   **Description:** Verify that the main navigation links in the header and footer are functional and navigate to the correct pages.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to https://www.coinbase.com.\n            2.  Identify the main navigation links (e.g., \"Pricing\", \"Learn\", \"Individuals\", \"Institutions\", \"Developers\", \"Company\").\n            3.  Click on each link.\n        *   **Expected Result:** Each link navigates to the expected corresponding page without errors.\n\n    *   **TC_SMOKE_003: Hero Headline Verification**\n        *   **Description:** Verify that the hero headline on the homepage contains the correct text: \"The easiest place to buy and sell crypto\".\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to https://www.coinbase.com.\n            2.  Locate the main hero headline element on the page (typically an `<h1>` tag or a prominent `<h2>` tag).\n            3.  Extract the text content of the headline.\n        *   **Expected Result:** The headline text matches exactly: \"The easiest place to buy and sell crypto\".\n\n    *   **TC_SMOKE_004: \"Get Started\" Button Functionality**\n        *   **Description:** Verify that the \"Get Started\" button on the homepage is present and navigates the user to the account creation/signup page.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to https://www.coinbase.com.\n            2.  Locate the \"Get Started\" button (identify by text content or common UI patterns for buttons).\n            3.  Click the \"Get Started\" button.\n        *   **Expected Result:** The user is redirected to the account creation/signup page (the exact URL will need to be determined - e.g., /signup, /register, etc.).  A 200 OK HTTP status code is returned for the signup page.\n\n**6. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents**\n\nThis section provides guidance to the autonomous agents on how to prioritize element identification and interaction.\n\n*   **Prioritized Elements:**\n    *   **Hero Headline:** Focus on identifying `<h1>` or `<h2>` elements within the main section of the homepage. Use semantic analysis to confirm it's the main headline.\n    *   **Navigation Links:** Identify `<nav>` elements and within them, `<a>` tags. Prioritize links with common navigation labels like \"Pricing\", \"Learn\", \"Individuals\", \"Institutions\".  Also mine links from the `<footer>`.\n    *   **\"Get Started\" Button:** Look for `<button>` or `<a>` elements with the text \"Get Started\" or similar calls to action (e.g., \"Sign Up\", \"Create Account\"). Pay attention to buttons with prominent styling (e.g., primary call-to-action color). Use `aria-label` attribute if it exists.\n*   **Page Structure Awareness:**\n    *   Understand the basic structure of a webpage (header, main content, footer). Focus mining efforts within the `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` elements.\n    *   Use CSS selectors and XPath expressions to target elements within specific sections of the page.\n*   **Dynamic Content Handling:**\n    *   Be aware that some elements may be dynamically loaded using JavaScript. Implement mechanisms to wait for elements to be present in the DOM before attempting to interact with them (e.g., explicit waits, implicit waits).\n    *   If the headline or button text is dynamic, use regular expressions or fuzzy matching to verify it contains the expected keywords.\n*   **Error Handling:**\n    *   Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions such as element not found, timeout errors, and network errors.\n    *   Log all errors with detailed information for debugging purposes.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate clear and concise reports that summarize the results of the smoke tests.  Include pass/fail status for each test case, screenshots of any errors, and relevant log data.\n\n**7. Test Environment**\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version) - configured for headless operation.\n*   **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection.\n\n**8. Entry Criteria**\n\n*   A new build has been deployed to the target environment (staging or production).\n*   The test environment is set up and configured correctly.\n*   The autonomous agents are deployed and configured correctly.\n\n**9. Exit Criteria**\n\n*   All smoke test cases have been executed.\n*   All critical defects have been resolved.\n*   A test report has been generated and reviewed.\n\n**10. Test Deliverables**\n\n*   Test Plan Document (this document).\n*   Test Scripts (code used by autonomous agents).\n*   Test Results Report.\n*   Defect Tracking Log (if any defects are found).\n\n**11. Roles and Responsibilities**\n\n*   **QA Strategist (You):** Create and maintain the Master Test Plan, define test cases, and provide guidance to the autonomous agents.\n*   **Autonomous Agents:** Execute test scripts, collect data, and generate reports.\n*   **Development Team:** Resolve any defects identified during testing.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for smoke testing Coinbase.com. By following these guidelines, autonomous agents can effectively identify critical issues and ensure the core functionality of the website is operational. Good luck!"
