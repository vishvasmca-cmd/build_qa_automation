This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite to ensure the core functionality of the login page is operational.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point for all users and critical for accessing the system's functionalities. Failure of the login page directly impacts all users and prevents them from performing their HR-related tasks.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the login page can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Productivity:** Users unable to access the system cannot perform their HR duties.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Frequent login issues can erode user trust and damage the company's reputation.\n    *   **Financial Impact:** Inability to manage HR functions can lead to compliance issues and potential fines.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of all login page elements (username field, password field, login button, OrangeHRM logo).\n        *   Functionality of the \"Forgot your password?\" link.\n        *   Visibility and accessibility of social media icons (if present).\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials (checking for appropriate error message).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed error handling for various invalid input scenarios (e.g., SQL injection attempts).\n        *   Performance testing of the login page.\n        *   Security testing beyond basic invalid login attempts.\n        *   Testing of the system after successful login (this will be covered in other smoke and regression tests).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the login page is functional and accessible.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Page Load Verification:** Verify the login page loads successfully and displays all expected elements (username, password, login button, logo).\n        2.  **Valid Login:** Verify successful login with valid credentials (using a known test user).\n        3.  **Invalid Login:** Verify an appropriate error message is displayed when attempting to log in with invalid credentials.\n        4.  **Forgot Password Link:** Verify the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects to the correct page.\n        5.  **Social Media Icons:** Verify social media icons are visible and link to the correct pages (if present).\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** (This is a high-level outline, as the primary focus is smoke testing)\n    *   The regression suite will be built *after* the smoke suite is stable.\n    *   It will include more detailed scenarios, such as:\n        *   Different types of invalid credentials (e.g., empty fields, special characters).\n        *   Password reset functionality (end-to-end).\n        *   Accessibility testing (e.g., keyboard navigation).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:**\n        *   **Valid Credentials:** A dedicated test user with known valid credentials will be used for the \"Valid Login\" test case. These credentials should be stored securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secure configuration file).\n        *   **Invalid Credentials:** Hardcoded invalid credentials (e.g., \"invalid_user\", \"invalid_password\") will be used for the \"Invalid Login\" test case.\n    *   **Data Management:**\n        *   Test data will be managed centrally to ensure consistency across all tests.\n        *   Consider using a data-driven testing approach for the regression suite to handle a wider range of scenarios.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n        *   Create a `LoginPage` class that encapsulates all elements and actions related to the login page (e.g., `enterUsername()`, `enterPassword()`, `clickLoginButton()`, `getErrorMessage()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with explicit waits) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading or becoming visible.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed test steps (e.g., retrying a click operation if it fails due to an element not being clickable).\n        *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI-powered tools to automatically identify and fix broken locators) as the test suite matures.\n    *   **Locator Strategy:**\n        *   Prioritize robust locators (e.g., IDs, ARIA attributes) over fragile locators (e.g., XPaths based on text content).\n        *   Implement a locator strategy that minimizes the impact of UI changes on the test suite.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** The login page itself (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/).\n    *   **Secondary Target:** The \"Forgot your password?\" page (reached via the link on the login page).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Page Load:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200 (OK).\n        *   Expected page title is present.\n        *   All expected elements (username field, password field, login button, logo) are visible.\n    *   **Valid Login:**\n        *   HTTP status code 302 (Redirect) or 200 (OK) for the target page after login.\n        *   User is redirected to the expected page after login (e.g., the dashboard).\n        *   A welcome message or user profile element is visible on the target page.\n    *   **Invalid Login:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200 (OK) for the login page.\n        *   An error message is displayed on the login page.\n        *   The user remains on the login page.\n    *   **Forgot Password Link:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200 (OK) for the \"Forgot your password?\" page.\n        *   The user is redirected to the \"Forgot your password?\" page.\n        *   The expected elements (e.g., username field, reset password button) are visible on the \"Forgot your password?\" page.\n    *   **Social Media Icons:**\n        *   Social media icons are visible.\n        *   Clicking on the icons redirects to the correct social media pages.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the OrangeHRM login page. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the core functionality of the login page is reliable and meets the needs of the users."
