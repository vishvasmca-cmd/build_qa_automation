This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable automated test suite.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure of the login page directly impacts all users and prevents access to critical HR functions.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**:\n    *   **High Risk**: Login failure prevents access to the system, leading to significant business disruption.\n    *   **Financial Loss**: Inability to manage HR functions can lead to payroll errors, compliance issues, and potential legal ramifications.\n    *   **Trust Loss**: Unreliable access erodes user confidence in the system.\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Verification of all login page elements (username field, password field, login button, OrangeHRM logo).\n        *   Functionality of the \"Forgot your password?\" link.\n        *   Visibility and presence of social media icons.\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials (verifying appropriate error message).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed testing of password reset functionality (beyond link verification).\n        *   Testing of individual social media links (external to the application).\n        *   Performance testing of the login page.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited to primary browser initially).\n        *   Accessibility testing (initial smoke, more in-depth later).\n        *   Localization testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis section details the specific testing approach for the smoke test suite.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the core functionality of the login page is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Page Load Verification**: Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status).\n        2.  **Element Presence**: Verify the presence of the username field, password field, login button, and OrangeHRM logo.\n        3.  **Forgot Password Link**: Verify the \"Forgot your password?\" link is present and clickable.\n        4.  **Social Media Icons**: Verify the social media icons are present.\n        5.  **Successful Login**: Verify successful login with valid credentials (pre-defined test user).\n        6.  **Invalid Login**: Verify appropriate error message is displayed when attempting to log in with invalid credentials.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**:\n    *   **Not applicable for Smoke Testing.** Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Static Data**: Use a pre-defined set of valid and invalid credentials stored in a configuration file or environment variables.\n    *   **Credentials**:\n        *   **Valid User**: `Admin / admin123` (default credentials)\n        *   **Invalid User**: `InvalidUser / InvalidPassword`\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\nThis section provides architectural guidance for building a maintainable and resilient test automation framework.\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent the login page as a Page Object. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n        *   **LoginPage.java**: Contains elements and methods related to the login page (e.g., `enterUsername()`, `enterPassword()`, `clickLoginButton()`, `isErrorMessageDisplayed()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` with explicit conditions) to handle potential timing issues when verifying element presence or error messages.\n    *   **Element Locators**: Use robust element locators (e.g., `id`, `name`, `xpath` - in that order of preference) to minimize the impact of UI changes on test stability. Avoid brittle locators like text-based xpaths.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches). Limit the number of retries to avoid masking genuine failures.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\nThis section provides instructions for executing the smoke tests and identifying potential areas for further exploration.\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Login Page (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/)**: Focus on verifying all elements and functionalities on this page.\n    2.  **\"Forgot your password?\" Link**: Verify the link navigates to the password reset page.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Page Load**: HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Element Presence**: Elements are visible and interactable.\n    *   **Successful Login**: User is redirected to the home page after successful login.\n    *   **Invalid Login**: An appropriate error message is displayed on the login page.\n    *   **No Exceptions**: No unhandled exceptions or errors during test execution.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for smoke testing the OrangeHRM login page. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a robust and reliable test suite that effectively identifies critical issues early in the development cycle."
