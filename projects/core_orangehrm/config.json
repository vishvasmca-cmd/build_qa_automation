This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure of the login page prevents users from accessing any functionality.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A malfunctioning login page results in:\n    *   **Loss of Productivity:** Users cannot access the system to perform their HR-related tasks.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Unreliable access can erode user trust in the system.\n    *   **Potential Financial Impact:** Delays in HR processes (e.g., payroll, onboarding) can lead to financial penalties or inefficiencies.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of all elements on the login page (username field, password field, login button, logo, forgot password link, social media icons).\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Navigation to the \"Forgot Password\" page via the link.\n        *   Visibility and basic functionality (link existence) of social media icons.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed testing of the \"Forgot Password\" functionality (email sending, password reset process).\n        *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials, locked accounts).\n        *   Performance testing of the login page.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited to primary browser - e.g., Chrome).\n        *   Detailed validation of social media links (external site validation).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the core functionality of the login page is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Page Load Verification:** Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Element Presence:** Verify all key elements are present:\n            *   Username field\n            *   Password field\n            *   Login button\n            *   OrangeHRM logo\n            *   \"Forgot your password?\" link\n            *   Social media icons (at least one)\n        3.  **Successful Login:** Login with valid, pre-defined credentials. Verify successful redirection to the main dashboard.\n        4.  **Forgot Password Link:** Click the \"Forgot your password?\" link. Verify redirection to the \"Forgot Password\" page.\n        5.  **Social Media Icon Presence:** Verify that the social media icons are displayed on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing. This section would be populated in a full Regression Test Strategy.*\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use a single, pre-defined set of valid credentials for the successful login test case. This data should be stored securely and be easily accessible to the test scripts.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the login page as a Page Object. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `LoginPage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the login page (e.g., `usernameField`, `passwordField`, `loginButton`, `enterUsername()`, `enterPassword()`, `clickLogin()`, `clickForgotPasswordLink()`).\n        *   `DashboardPage.java`: Represents the main dashboard page after successful login.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential delays in page loading or element rendering. This will reduce flakiness.\n    *   **Example:** `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, \"dashboard-header\")));`\n    *   **Element Identification:** Use robust element locators (e.g., `ID`, `CSS Selector`) that are less likely to change. Avoid using `XPath` unless absolutely necessary.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **`https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/`**: The primary URL for the login page.\n    2.  **`https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/index.php/auth/requestPasswordResetCode`**: The \"Forgot Password\" page (reached via the link on the login page).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Page Load:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    2.  **Element Presence:** Elements are visible and enabled (where applicable).\n    3.  **Successful Login:** Redirection to the main dashboard page. Verify the presence of a unique element on the dashboard (e.g., a welcome message or a dashboard header).\n    4.  **Forgot Password Link:** Redirection to the \"Forgot Password\" page. Verify the presence of the \"Reset Password\" form.\n    5.  **Social Media Icons:** Icons are visible.  A simple `href` check to ensure they are populated (but not necessarily valid).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the OrangeHRM login page. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the critical functionality of the login page is working as expected."
