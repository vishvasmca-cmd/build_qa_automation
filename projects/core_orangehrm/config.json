This strategy focuses on smoke testing to ensure the core functionality of the login page is operational.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure of the login page prevents access to all HR functions, impacting all users.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A malfunctioning login page results in:\n    *   **High Impact:** Prevents access to critical HR functions (payroll, employee management, etc.).\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Erodes user trust in the system's reliability.\n    *   **Operational Disruption:** Halts HR processes, leading to delays and inefficiencies.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of login page elements (username, password fields, login button).\n        *   Functionality of the \"Forgot your password?\" link.\n        *   Visibility and basic functionality (link existence) of social media icons.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed error handling (invalid credentials, account lockout).\n        *   Performance testing (login speed).\n        *   Security testing (vulnerability scans).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (beyond a single, primary browser).\n        *   Full regression testing of the entire application.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a smoke test suite to quickly validate the core functionality of the login page.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Confirm that the login page is accessible and key elements are functional.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Page Load Verification:** Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   Username field\n            *   Password field\n            *   Login button\n            *   \"Forgot your password?\" link\n            *   Social media icons (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube)\n        3.  **Forgot Password Link:** Verify that the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects to the password reset page.\n        4.  **Social Media Icons:** Verify that each social media icon is present and links to a valid URL (basic URL validation, not full content verification).\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy. This section is included for future expansion.)\n    *   A full regression suite would include:\n        *   Valid login attempts with different user roles.\n        *   Invalid login attempts with various error messages.\n        *   Password reset functionality testing.\n        *   Account lockout scenarios.\n        *   Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility testing.\n        *   Security vulnerability testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** For smoke tests, static data is sufficient. No need for dynamic generation.\n    *   **Credentials:** Use a single, valid test user account with known credentials for the \"Forgot Password\" link verification.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create a `LoginPage` class that encapsulates all elements and actions related to the login page. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for elements to load.\n    *   **Element Locators:** Use robust element locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `data-qa`) that are less likely to change with UI updates. Avoid fragile locators like XPath based on position.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **`/` (Root URL):** This should redirect to the login page.\n    2.  **`/web/index.php/auth/login`:** Direct access to the login page.\n    3.  **\"Forgot your password?\" Link:** Inspect the link's `href` attribute to verify the target URL.\n    4.  **Social Media Icons:** Inspect each icon's `href` attribute to verify the target URL.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Page Load Verification:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    2.  **Element Presence:** Elements are visible and enabled (where applicable).\n    3.  **Forgot Password Link:** Redirects to the password reset page (verify URL contains `/requestPasswordResetCode`).\n    4.  **Social Media Icons:** Each icon links to the correct social media page (verify URL matches the expected pattern for each platform).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for verifying the core functionality of the OrangeHRM login page. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical aspects of the system to ensure its stability and reliability."
