  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Login Page (Smoke Test)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the OrangeHRM login page, focusing on a smoke test suite. This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable automated testing framework.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure of the login functionality directly impacts all users and prevents access to critical HR functions.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A malfunctioning login page can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Productivity:** Employees and HR staff unable to access the system.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception of the software's reliability.\n    *   **Potential Security Vulnerabilities:** If login mechanisms are compromised.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of all login page elements (username field, password field, login button).\n        *   Functionality of the \"Forgot your password?\" link.\n        *   Visibility of social media icons.\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials (one positive test).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Negative login scenarios (invalid credentials, locked accounts, etc.).\n        *   Detailed password reset flow testing.\n        *   Social media icon link validation (redirects to correct pages).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic input validation).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** To ensure the login page is functional and accessible.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Verify Login Page Elements:** Ensure username field, password field, and login button are present and visible.\n        2.  **Verify \"Forgot your password?\" Link:** Ensure the link is present and clickable.\n        3.  **Verify Social Media Icons:** Ensure the social media icons are present and visible.\n        4.  **Successful Login:** Login with valid credentials (pre-defined user) to verify basic authentication.\n*   **Regression Suite (Future Expansion):** *This section outlines the future direction for regression testing, which is currently out of scope.*\n    *   **Objective:** To ensure that changes to the login page or related modules do not introduce regressions.\n    *   **Test Cases (Examples):**\n        *   Invalid Login Attempts: Verify error messages for incorrect username/password.\n        *   Password Reset Flow: Test the complete password reset process.\n        *   Account Locking: Verify account locking after multiple failed login attempts.\n        *   Remember Me Functionality: Test the \"Remember Me\" checkbox.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Smoke Tests:** Use a static, pre-defined user account with known credentials for the successful login test. This account should have minimal privileges to reduce the risk of unintended side effects.\n    *   **Regression Tests (Future):** Implement a combination of static and dynamically generated test data. Static data can be used for common scenarios, while dynamic data generation can be used for boundary testing and negative scenarios.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the login page as a Page Object. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   **Language:** [Choose a language based on team expertise - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript].\n    *   **Test Framework:** [Choose a framework based on language - e.g., JUnit, pytest, Mocha].\n    *   **Assertion Library:** [Choose an assertion library - e.g., AssertJ, Chai, Hamcrest].\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits and use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future):** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **`https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/`**: Focus on the login form elements.\n    2.  **\"Forgot your password?\" Link**: Inspect the link's target URL.\n    3.  **Social Media Icons**: Identify the presence and type of icons.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that the login page returns an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that all required elements (username field, password field, login button, \"Forgot your password?\" link, social media icons) are visible on the page.\n    *   **Successful Login:** After entering valid credentials, verify that the user is redirected to the home page (or a designated landing page) and that a welcome message or user profile information is displayed.\n    *   **\"Forgot your password?\" Link**: Verify that clicking the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects to the password reset page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the OrangeHRM login page. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the reliability and stability of this critical component. This document will be reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in the application or testing requirements."
