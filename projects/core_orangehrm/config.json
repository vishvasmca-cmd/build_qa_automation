  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Login Page\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the OrangeHRM login page, focusing on smoke testing to ensure core functionality and stability. This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. Login functionality is the entry point and a critical component. Failure here prevents access to all other modules, impacting all users.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**: A failure in the login page can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Productivity**: Users unable to access the system cannot perform their HR-related tasks.\n    *   **Reputational Damage**: Frequent login issues can erode user trust and confidence in the system.\n    *   **Potential Security Risks**: If login mechanisms are flawed, it could expose the system to unauthorized access.\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Verification of all elements on the login page (username, password fields, login button, logo, copyright text).\n        *   Functionality of the \"Forgot your password?\" link.\n        *   Visibility and basic functionality (link to external pages) of social media icons.\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials (error message verification).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed testing of password reset functionality (covered in regression).\n        *   Performance testing of the login page.\n        *   Security vulnerability testing (penetration testing).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited to primary browsers in smoke).\n        *   Localization testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Purpose**: To quickly verify the login page is functional and accessible.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Page Load**: Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Element Verification**: Verify all key elements (username field, password field, login button, logo) are present and visible.\n        3.  **Valid Login**: Attempt login with valid credentials and verify successful redirection to the dashboard.\n        4.  **Invalid Login**: Attempt login with invalid credentials and verify the correct error message is displayed.\n        5.  **Forgot Password Link**: Verify the \"Forgot your password?\" link is present and navigates to the password reset page.\n        6.  **Social Media Icons**: Verify social media icons are present and link to the correct external pages.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**: (Not the focus of this document, but for context)\n    *   The regression suite will cover more in-depth scenarios, including:\n        *   Password reset functionality testing.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., SQL injection attempts).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility.\n        *   Performance under load.\n        *   Security vulnerabilities.\n        *   Remember Me functionality.\n        *   Account Lockout Policy.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Smoke Tests**: Use a small set of static, pre-defined credentials for valid and invalid login attempts. These credentials should be stored securely.\n    *   **Regression Tests**: Employ a more dynamic data strategy, potentially using data generation techniques or a larger dataset to cover various user roles and scenarios.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent the login page and its elements. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n        *   `LoginPage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the login page (e.g., `enterUsername()`, `enterPassword()`, `clickLoginButton()`, `getErrorMessage()`).\n        *   `DashboardPage.java`: Represents the dashboard page after successful login.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for elements to load or error messages to appear.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Limited)**: For locators that are prone to change, consider implementing a basic self-healing mechanism (e.g., using multiple locators and trying them in order).  Full self-healing is not recommended for smoke tests due to the need for speed and reliability.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/`: The primary URL for the login page.\n    2.  `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/index.php/auth/requestPasswordResetCode`: The URL for the \"Forgot your password?\" page.\n    3.  Social Media URLs (inspect the links on the page).\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **HTTP Status Code**: Verify that all pages return an HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility**: Verify that all key elements (username field, password field, login button, logo, copyright text, social media icons) are visible on the login page.\n    *   **Text Verification**: Verify the presence of specific text elements, such as the error message for invalid login attempts.\n    *   **Redirection**: Verify that successful login redirects to the dashboard page.\n    *   **Link Functionality**: Verify that the \"Forgot your password?\" link navigates to the correct page and that social media icons link to the correct external pages.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the OrangeHRM login page. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the stability and reliability of this critical component."
