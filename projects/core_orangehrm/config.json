This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure of the login functionality directly impacts all users and prevents access to critical HR functions.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A failure in the login page can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Productivity:** Employees and HR staff cannot access the system.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception of the system's reliability.\n    *   **Business Disruption:** Inability to perform essential HR tasks.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of login page elements (username, password fields, login button).\n        *   Functionality of the \"Forgot your password?\" link.\n        *   Visibility of social media icons.\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials (checking error message).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed error handling for various invalid input scenarios (e.g., SQL injection).\n        *   Performance testing of the login process.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially focus on a primary browser).\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n        *   Testing of specific HR modules after login.\n        *   Social media link validation.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the login page's basic functionality and ensure the application is accessible.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Page Load:** Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Element Visibility:** Verify the presence of username field, password field, login button, \"Forgot your password?\" link, and social media icons.\n        3.  **Valid Login:** Attempt login with valid credentials (pre-defined test user).\n        4.  **Invalid Login:** Attempt login with invalid credentials (verify error message).\n        5.  **Forgot Password Link:** Click the \"Forgot your password?\" link and verify redirection to the password reset page.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** (Not applicable for this initial smoke test strategy, but included for future expansion)\n    *   This will be developed later to cover more comprehensive scenarios.\n    *   Examples:\n        *   Different user roles and their login permissions.\n        *   Account lockout scenarios.\n        *   Password complexity requirements.\n        *   Session management.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Test Data:** For the smoke tests, use a small set of pre-defined, static credentials for a valid user and invalid user. This ensures consistency and repeatability.\n    *   **Data Security:** Ensure that the test data used does not contain any sensitive or real user information.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the login page as a Page Object. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `LoginPage.java`: Contains elements (username field, password field, login button, etc.) and methods (enterUsername, enterPassword, clickLogin, clickForgotPassword, etc.).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading or becoming interactable.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future):** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically identify and recover from broken locators.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page (`https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/`):** Focus on all elements and interactions within this page.\n    2.  **Forgot Password Page (reached via link on Login Page):** Verify basic page load and element presence.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Page Load Success:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Elements are present and visible on the page.\n    *   **Successful Login:** User is redirected to the dashboard page after entering valid credentials.\n    *   **Failed Login:** An appropriate error message is displayed after entering invalid credentials.\n    *   **Forgot Password Redirection:** Clicking the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects the user to the password reset page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the OrangeHRM login page. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the core functionality is robust and reliable, providing a solid foundation for future development and testing efforts."
