  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Login Page\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the OrangeHRM login page (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/). It serves as the blueprint for all testing activities, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure here prevents access to all other functionalities.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**: A failure on the login page results in:\n    *   **High Severity**: Complete system unavailability.\n    *   **High Probability**: Login issues are common and can be caused by various factors (server issues, code defects, network problems).\n    *   **Impact**: Loss of productivity, potential business disruption, and damage to user trust.\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Verification of all elements on the login page (username field, password field, login button, logo, forgot password link, social media icons).\n        *   Functionality of the \"Forgot Password\" link.\n        *   Accessibility of social media icons.\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials (error message validation).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed testing of the HR functionalities after login.\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress).\n        *   Security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially focus on Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a **Smoke Test** approach, ensuring the core functionality of the login page is operational.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the login page is accessible and the basic elements are present and functional.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Page Load**: Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Element Presence**: Verify the presence of:\n            *   Username field\n            *   Password field\n            *   Login button\n            *   OrangeHRM logo\n            *   \"Forgot your password?\" link\n            *   Social media icons (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube)\n        3.  **Valid Login**: Verify successful login with valid credentials (predefined test user).\n        4.  **Invalid Login**: Verify correct error message is displayed with invalid credentials.\n        5.  **Forgot Password Link**: Verify the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects to the password reset page.\n        6.  **Social Media Links**: Verify social media icons are clickable and redirect to the correct pages.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**: *Not applicable for the initial smoke test phase.* A regression suite will be developed later to cover more extensive scenarios.\n\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Valid Credentials**: Use a static, predefined test user with known credentials. This user should have minimal privileges to avoid unintended side effects.\n    *   **Invalid Credentials**: Use hardcoded invalid usernames and passwords to trigger error messages.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**: **Page Object Model (POM)**.\n    *   Create a `LoginPage` class that encapsulates all elements and actions related to the login page.\n    *   This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Implement explicit waits for elements to become visible or clickable before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., retry a test 2-3 times before marking it as failed).\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Login Page**: `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/`\n    2.  **Forgot Password Page**: (Accessed via the \"Forgot your password?\" link on the login page)\n    3.  **Social Media Pages**: (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube - accessed via the icons on the login page)\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **HTTP Status Code**: Verify HTTP 200 for successful page loads.\n    *   **Element Visibility**: Verify the presence and visibility of all required elements on the login page.\n    *   **Text Verification**: Verify the correct error messages are displayed for invalid login attempts.\n    *   **Redirection**: Verify the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects to the correct page.\n    *   **Login Success**: Verify successful login redirects to the home page (dashboard).\n    *   **Social Media Links**: Verify social media links redirect to the correct external pages.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for testing the OrangeHRM login page. It prioritizes critical functionality and sets the foundation for a robust and maintainable test automation framework."
