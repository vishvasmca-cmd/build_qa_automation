  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Login Page\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the OrangeHRM login page, focusing on smoke testing to ensure core functionality is operational. This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure of the login functionality directly impacts all users and prevents access to critical HR functions.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Inability to log in prevents users from accessing the system, leading to significant business disruption.\n    *   **Financial Loss:** If employees cannot access timekeeping or payroll functions.\n    *   **Trust Loss:** Users lose confidence in the system's reliability.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of login page elements (username, password fields, login button).\n        *   Functionality of the \"Forgot your password?\" link.\n        *   Visibility and presence of social media icons.\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials (error message verification).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed error handling for specific password policies.\n        *   Performance testing of the login page.\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n        *   Localization testing (different languages).\n        *   Testing of social media links' functionality (redirection to external sites).\n        *   Testing of remember me functionality.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a smoke test suite to ensure the login page's basic functionality is working as expected.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the core functionality of the login page.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Verify Login Page Elements:** Ensure username, password fields, and login button are present and visible.\n        2.  **Check \"Forgot your password?\" Link:** Verify the link is present and clickable.\n        3.  **View Social Media Icons:** Ensure social media icons are present and visible.\n        4.  **Successful Login:** Log in with valid credentials (using a known, stable test user).\n        5.  **Unsuccessful Login:** Attempt to log in with invalid credentials and verify the appropriate error message is displayed.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** (Not the focus of this document, but included for future expansion)\n    *   This will be a more comprehensive suite to be developed later.\n    *   It will include:\n        *   Negative testing with various invalid inputs (e.g., SQL injection attempts).\n        *   Boundary testing (e.g., maximum password length).\n        *   Testing with different user roles and permissions.\n        *   Testing after any code changes or deployments.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Test Data:** For the smoke tests, use a static set of valid and invalid credentials. This ensures consistency and repeatability.  These credentials should be stored securely (e.g., in a configuration file or secrets management system).\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data (Future):** For the regression suite, consider dynamic test data generation to cover a wider range of scenarios.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement the POM design pattern. This will improve maintainability and reduce code duplication. Create a `LoginPage` class that encapsulates all elements and actions related to the login page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading or becoming visible.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before interacting with elements.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future):** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI-powered element locators) to automatically adapt to UI changes.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **`https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/`**: Focus on the login form and its elements.\n    2.  **`https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/index.php/auth/requestPasswordResetCode`**: Explore the \"Forgot your password?\" page.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   **HTTP 200 OK:** The page loads successfully.\n        *   **Element Visibility:** All required elements (username, password, login button, \"Forgot your password?\" link, social media icons) are visible on the page.\n        *   **Successful Login:** After entering valid credentials, the user is redirected to the dashboard page.\n        *   **Unsuccessful Login:** After entering invalid credentials, an appropriate error message is displayed on the login page.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   Any HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n        *   Missing or invisible elements.\n        *   Incorrect redirection after login.\n        *   Incorrect or missing error messages.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the OrangeHRM login page. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the reliability and stability of this critical component."
