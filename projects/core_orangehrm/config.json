  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Login Page (Smoke Test)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the OrangeHRM login page, focusing on smoke testing. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding test automation and execution.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure of the login page directly impacts all users and prevents access to critical HR functions. Therefore, the login page is considered **P0 (Priority Zero)**.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the login page can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Productivity:** Employees and HR staff unable to access the system.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception of the system's reliability.\n    *   **Potential Security Risks:** If login mechanisms are compromised.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of login page elements (username, password fields, login button).\n        *   Functionality of the \"Forgot your password?\" link.\n        *   Visibility and presence of social media icons.\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials (checking error message).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed error handling for various invalid input scenarios (e.g., SQL injection attempts).\n        *   Performance testing (load times, concurrency).\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (beyond a single, primary browser).\n        *   Testing of specific social media links (redirection, content).\n        *   Testing of the password reset process (beyond link verification).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core functionality of the login page after deployment or code changes.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Verify Login Page Elements:** Ensure username field, password field, and login button are present and visible.\n        2.  **Verify \"Forgot your password?\" Link:** Ensure the link is present and clickable.\n        3.  **Verify Social Media Icons:** Ensure the icons are present and visible.\n        4.  **Successful Login:** Login with valid credentials (pre-defined test user) and verify successful redirection to the home page.\n        5.  **Unsuccessful Login:** Attempt login with invalid credentials and verify the appropriate error message is displayed.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy. This section would be populated for a full regression test plan.)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Valid Credentials:** Use a static, pre-defined test user with known valid credentials. This user should have minimal permissions to avoid impacting other parts of the system during the smoke test.\n    *   **Invalid Credentials:** Use hardcoded invalid username/password combinations.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create a `LoginPage` class that encapsulates all elements and actions related to the login page. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or clickable, especially after page loads or AJAX requests. This helps mitigate flakiness due to timing issues.\n    *   **Element Locators:** Use robust element locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `data-qa`) that are less likely to change during UI updates. Avoid relying solely on CSS selectors or XPath expressions that are tightly coupled to the UI structure.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed login attempts (e.g., retry the login action 1-2 times with a short delay). This can help overcome transient network issues or server hiccups.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page (`/auth/login`):** Focus all exploration on the login page elements and their immediate interactions.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Element Visibility:** Verify that all required elements (username field, password field, login button, \"Forgot your password?\" link, social media icons) are visible on the page.\n    2.  **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that the login page returns an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    3.  **Successful Login:** After successful login, verify that the user is redirected to the home page and that a \"Welcome\" message or user profile information is displayed.\n    4.  **Unsuccessful Login:** After an unsuccessful login attempt, verify that an appropriate error message is displayed on the login page. The error message should be clear and informative.\n    5.  **Link Functionality:** Verify that the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects to the password reset page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the OrangeHRM login page. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the stability and reliability of this critical component."
