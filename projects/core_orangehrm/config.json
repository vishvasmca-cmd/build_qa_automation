  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Login Page (Smoke Test)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the OrangeHRM login page, focusing on smoke testing to ensure the core functionality is operational. This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point for all users, making its availability and functionality critical. Failure of the login page directly impacts all users and prevents access to the entire system.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the login page can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Productivity:** Employees and administrators cannot access the system to perform their tasks.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** System unavailability can damage the company's reputation and erode user trust.\n    *   **Financial Impact:** Inability to manage HR functions can lead to delays in payroll, benefits administration, and other critical processes, potentially resulting in financial penalties or compliance issues.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of all login page elements (username field, password field, login button, logo, forgot password link, social media icons).\n        *   Functionality of the \"Forgot Password\" link.\n        *   Visibility and basic functionality (link existence) of social media icons.\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials (one test case).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed negative testing of login functionality (invalid username, password, etc.).\n        *   Testing of the HRM system's internal functionalities beyond the initial login.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS verification).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** To quickly verify the basic health and operability of the login page.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Page Element Verification:** Verify the presence and correct labels of all key elements:\n            *   Username field (label: \"Username\")\n            *   Password field (label: \"Password\")\n            *   Login button (label: \"Login\")\n            *   OrangeHRM logo\n            *   \"Forgot your password?\" link\n            *   Social media icons (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube)\n        2.  **Forgot Password Link:** Verify that the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects to the correct password reset page.\n        3.  **Social Media Icons:** Verify that each social media icon is visible and links to the corresponding social media page.  (Only verify the link exists and returns a 200 OK, not the content of the social media page).\n        4.  **Successful Login:** Verify that a user can successfully log in with valid credentials (using a pre-defined test user).\n*   **Regression Suite (Future Expansion - Not part of initial smoke):**\n    *   This section is for future expansion of the test suite beyond the initial smoke tests.\n    *   **Objective:** To ensure that changes to the login page or related systems do not introduce regressions.\n    *   **Potential Test Cases (Examples):**\n        *   Invalid login attempts with various error messages.\n        *   Password reset functionality (full flow).\n        *   Account lockout scenarios.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility.\n        *   Accessibility testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Smoke Tests:** Use a single, static set of valid credentials for the successful login test. These credentials should be stored securely and managed appropriately.\n    *   **Regression Tests (Future):** May require a more dynamic data strategy, potentially involving test data generation or access to a test database.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This pattern promotes maintainability and reusability by encapsulating page elements and interactions within dedicated page objects.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `LoginPage.java`: Contains elements (username field, password field, login button, etc.) and methods (enterUsername(), enterPassword(), clickLogin(), clickForgotPassword(), etc.) related to the login page.\n        *   `ForgotPasswordPage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the \"Forgot Password\" page.\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the main application page after successful login.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable, rather than relying on fixed timeouts.\n        *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry mechanisms for common failure points, such as network requests or element interactions.\n        *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically identify and recover from broken locators.\n    *   **Locator Strategy:**\n        *   Prioritize robust locators (e.g., IDs, ARIA attributes) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n        *   Implement a locator strategy that allows for easy updates if the application's UI changes.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page (`/` or `/login`):** Focus on identifying all interactive elements and their attributes.\n    2.  **Forgot Password Page (`/auth/requestPasswordResetCode`):** Explore the form elements and submission process.\n    3.  **Social Media Links:** Verify the URLs associated with each social media icon.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return a 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that all required elements are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that key labels and messages are displayed correctly (e.g., \"Username\", \"Password\", \"Forgot your password?\").\n    *   **Redirection:** Verify that the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects to the correct page.\n    *   **Successful Login:** Verify that a successful login redirects the user to the main application page (e.g., `/dashboard`).\n    *   **Social Media Links:** Verify that the social media links return a 200 OK status code.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the OrangeHRM login page. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the quality and reliability of this critical component."
