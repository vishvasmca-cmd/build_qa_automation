This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite to ensure the core functionality of the login page remains operational.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point for all users and critical for accessing the system's functionalities. Failure of the login page directly impacts all users and prevents them from accessing essential HR functions.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the login page can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Productivity:** Users cannot access the system to perform their HR-related tasks.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Unreliable access to the system can damage the company's reputation.\n    *   **Business Disruption:** Critical HR processes (e.g., payroll, time tracking) may be disrupted.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of all elements on the login page (username field, password field, login button, logo, forgot password link, social media icons).\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Navigation to the \"Forgot Password\" page via the link.\n        *   Visibility of social media icons.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed error handling for invalid login attempts (covered in Regression).\n        *   Testing specific social media links (covered in Regression).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS verification).\n        *   Multi-browser compatibility (initially focus on a single, primary browser).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the basic functionality of the login page after each build or deployment.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Login Page Elements Verification:** Verify that all expected elements (username field, password field, login button, logo, forgot password link, social media icons) are present and visible.\n        2.  **Successful Login:** Attempt to log in with valid, pre-defined credentials. Verify successful redirection to the main dashboard.\n        3.  **Forgot Password Link Navigation:** Click the \"Forgot Password\" link and verify that the user is redirected to the \"Forgot Password\" page.\n        4.  **Social Media Icons Visibility:** Verify that the social media icons are visible on the login page.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** (This is a high-level overview; details will be in a separate Regression Test Strategy document)\n    *   This suite will cover more in-depth testing of the login functionality, including:\n        *   Invalid login attempts and error message validation.\n        *   Password reset functionality.\n        *   Social media link validation.\n        *   Security testing (e.g., brute-force attack prevention).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Valid Credentials:** Use a static set of valid credentials for the smoke tests. These credentials should be stored securely and managed centrally.\n    *   **Data Management:** For smoke tests, avoid dynamic data generation. Keep the data simple and consistent.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent the login page and its elements. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n        *   Create a `LoginPage` class with methods for interacting with the login page elements (e.g., `enterUsername()`, `enterPassword()`, `clickLoginButton()`, `clickForgotPasswordLink()`).\n        *   Create a `DashboardPage` class to represent the main dashboard after successful login.\n        *   Create a `ForgotPasswordPage` class to represent the \"Forgot Password\" page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading or becoming visible. This will reduce flakiness in the tests.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically recover from minor UI changes. This could involve using more robust locators (e.g., XPath with text-based identification) and implementing retry mechanisms.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/):** Focus on identifying all elements on the page and their properties.\n    2.  **Login Flow:** Focus on the successful login flow with valid credentials.\n    3.  **Forgot Password Flow:** Focus on navigating to the \"Forgot Password\" page.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Login Page Elements Verification:**\n        *   All elements are present and visible on the page.\n        *   Elements are correctly positioned and styled.\n    *   **Successful Login:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code after submitting the login form.\n        *   Redirection to the main dashboard page.\n        *   Presence of a welcome message or user profile information on the dashboard.\n    *   **Forgot Password Link Navigation:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code after clicking the \"Forgot Password\" link.\n        *   Redirection to the \"Forgot Password\" page.\n        *   Presence of elements specific to the \"Forgot Password\" page (e.g., email input field, reset password button).\n    *   **Social Media Icons Visibility:**\n        *   Social media icons are visible on the login page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for smoke testing the OrangeHRM login page. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the core functionality of the login page remains operational and reliable. This document will be reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in the application or testing requirements."
