  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Login Page\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the OrangeHRM login page, focusing on smoke testing to ensure core functionality is operational. This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure of the login page directly impacts all users and prevents access to critical HR functions.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Inability to log in prevents access to all HR functions, leading to significant business disruption.\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Indirectly, if HR processes are disrupted (e.g., payroll, time tracking).\n    *   **Trust Loss:** Impacts user confidence in the system's reliability.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Login page elements (username, password fields, login button).\n        *   \"Forgot your password?\" link functionality.\n        *   Social media icons visibility.\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Error message display for invalid credentials.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed error handling for various invalid input types (e.g., SQL injection attempts).\n        *   Performance testing (load times).\n        *   Accessibility testing.\n        *   Browser compatibility testing (beyond a single, designated browser - Chrome latest).\n        *   Mobile device testing.\n        *   Functionality within the application after successful login (beyond verifying successful redirection).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Verify the login page is functional and accessible.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Page Load:** Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Element Visibility:** Verify username field, password field, login button, \"Forgot your password?\" link, and social media icons are visible.\n        3.  **Valid Login:** Verify successful login with valid credentials (predefined test user).\n        4.  **Invalid Login:** Verify error message is displayed with invalid credentials.\n        5.  **Forgot Password Link:** Verify the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects to the password reset page.\n*   **Regression Suite (Future Expansion - Not for initial smoke tests):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Ensure changes do not break existing login functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases (Examples):**\n        1.  **Password Reset:** Verify the password reset process works correctly.\n        2.  **Account Lockout:** Verify account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.\n        3.  **Security:** Verify protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., brute-force attacks).\n        4.  **Remember Me:** Verify \"Remember Me\" functionality (if implemented).\n        5.  **Localization:** Verify correct display of labels and messages in different languages (if applicable).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Smoke Tests:** Use static, predefined test data for valid and invalid login attempts. This data should be stored securely and be easily accessible.\n    *   **Regression Tests (Future):** May require dynamic test data generation for more complex scenarios (e.g., creating new users, resetting passwords).\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the login page and its elements. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n        *   Create a `LoginPage` class with methods for interacting with the username field, password field, login button, and \"Forgot your password?\" link.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class (or similar) to represent the page after successful login.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or enabled before interacting with them. This will help prevent tests from failing due to timing issues.\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future Consideration):**\n        *   Implement a mechanism to automatically retry failed tests.\n        *   Consider using AI-powered self-healing tools to automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login`\n    2.  **Forgot Password Page:** (Accessed via the \"Forgot your password?\" link on the login page)\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP 200 OK:** Verify the page loads successfully with an HTTP 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify the presence and visibility of the following elements:\n        *   Username field (with appropriate label)\n        *   Password field (with appropriate label)\n        *   Login button (with appropriate text)\n        *   \"Forgot your password?\" link\n        *   Social media icons (if present)\n    *   **Successful Login:** Verify redirection to the home page (or a designated dashboard) after successful login.\n    *   **Error Message:** Verify the display of an appropriate error message when invalid credentials are used. The message should be clear and informative.\n    *   **Link Redirection:** Verify the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects to the correct password reset page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the OrangeHRM login page. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the login functionality is robust, reliable, and meets the needs of the business."
