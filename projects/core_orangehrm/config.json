  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Login Page\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the OrangeHRM login page, focusing on smoke testing to ensure core functionality is operational. This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure of the login page directly impacts all users and prevents access to critical HR functions.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A malfunctioning login page can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Productivity:** Employees and HR staff unable to access the system.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception of the system's reliability.\n    *   **Potential Security Risks:** If vulnerabilities are introduced during login page changes.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of all login page elements (username field, password field, login button, forgot password link, social media icons).\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials (one user).\n        *   Navigation to the \"Forgot Password\" page.\n        *   Visibility and basic functionality of social media icons (link existence, not necessarily full redirection).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed negative login testing (invalid credentials, password policies, account lockout).\n        *   Comprehensive testing of the \"Forgot Password\" functionality (email sending, password reset process).\n        *   In-depth social media integration testing (redirection to social media sites, data sharing).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (limited to one primary browser initially, e.g., Chrome).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic input validation).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a lean, efficient smoke test suite.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the login page is accessible and core elements are functional.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Page Load:** Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Element Visibility:** Verify the username field, password field, login button, and \"Forgot Password\" link are visible.\n        3.  **Successful Login:** Login with valid, pre-defined credentials (one test user). Verify successful redirection to the home page (or a designated post-login page).\n        4.  **Forgot Password Link:** Click the \"Forgot Password\" link. Verify redirection to the \"Forgot Password\" page.\n        5.  **Social Media Icons:** Verify the social media icons are visible. Verify that each icon has an `href` attribute (link existence).\n*   **Regression Suite (Deferred):** A comprehensive regression suite will be developed *after* the smoke tests are stable and the application matures. This will include:\n    *   Alternative Flows (e.g., different login methods, SSO).\n    *   Negative Scenarios (e.g., invalid credentials, locked accounts).\n    *   Boundary Analysis (e.g., maximum password length).\n    *   Cross-Module Interactions (e.g., login affecting user profile settings).\n    *   Validation Messages (e.g., \"Invalid username or password\").\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Test Data:** Use a single, pre-defined user account with known credentials for the smoke tests. This simplifies setup and ensures consistency.  Credentials should be stored securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets management system).\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the login page and its elements. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `LoginPage.java` (or equivalent in the chosen language)\n            *   `usernameField` (WebElement)\n            *   `passwordField` (WebElement)\n            *   `loginButton` (WebElement)\n            *   `forgotPasswordLink` (WebElement)\n            *   `socialMediaIcons` (List<WebElement>)\n            *   `enterUsername(String username)` (method)\n            *   `enterPassword(String password)` (method)\n            *   `clickLogin()` (method)\n            *   `clickForgotPassword()` (method)\n            *   `getSocialMediaIconLinks()` (method)\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading or transitioning. This reduces flakiness.\n    *   **Example:** `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id(\"btnLogin\")));`\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests (e.g., using a TestNG retry analyzer or similar). This can help mitigate intermittent issues.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future Consideration):**  Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI-powered element locators) in the future to address locator changes.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page (`https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/`):**  Focus on identifying all interactive elements and their attributes.\n    2.  **\"Forgot Password\" Page (reached via the link on the login page):** Identify elements and their attributes.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP 200 OK:** The page loads successfully without server errors.\n    *   **Element Visibility:**  Elements are present and visible on the page.\n    *   **Successful Login:** Redirection to the expected post-login page (e.g., the OrangeHRM dashboard).  Verify the presence of a unique element on the dashboard (e.g., a welcome message or a specific menu item).\n    *   **Link Existence:** Social media icons have valid `href` attributes.\n    *   **No JavaScript Errors:**  Check the browser console for JavaScript errors during page load and interaction.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the OrangeHRM login page. By focusing on core functionality and implementing a robust architecture, the engineering team can ensure a reliable and stable entry point to the application."
