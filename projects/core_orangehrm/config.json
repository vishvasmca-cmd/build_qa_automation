  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Login Page\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the OrangeHRM login page, focusing on smoke testing to ensure core functionality is operational. This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure of the login page directly impacts all users and prevents access to critical HR functions.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**:\n    *   **High Risk**: Login failure prevents access to the system, leading to significant business disruption.\n    *   **Reputational Damage**: Frequent login issues erode user trust and damage the company's reputation.\n    *   **Financial Impact**: Inability to access HR functions can lead to delays in payroll, benefits administration, and other critical processes, potentially resulting in financial penalties.\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Verification of all login page elements (username field, password field, login button, logo, copyright text).\n        *   Functionality of the \"Forgot your password?\" link.\n        *   Visibility and basic functionality (link to external sites) of social media icons.\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials and appropriate error message display.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed testing of password reset functionality (beyond link verification).\n        *   Performance testing of the login page.\n        *   Security testing (e.g., brute-force attacks).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially focus on a primary browser).\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n        *   Localization testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a smoke test suite to validate the core functionality of the login page.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the login page is accessible and the basic elements are functional.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Page Load Verification**: Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n        2.  **Element Presence**: Verify the presence of the username field, password field, login button, OrangeHRM logo, and copyright text.\n        3.  **Forgot Password Link**: Verify the \"Forgot your password?\" link is present and navigates to the password reset page.\n        4.  **Social Media Icons**: Verify the social media icons are visible and link to the correct external pages.\n        5.  **Successful Login**: Verify a user can successfully log in with valid credentials.\n        6.  **Failed Login**: Verify a user receives an appropriate error message when attempting to log in with invalid credentials.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**: (Not the focus of this document, but included for future planning)\n    *   **Objective**: Ensure changes to the application do not negatively impact the login page functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases**: (Examples)\n        *   Invalid login attempts with different types of invalid data (e.g., SQL injection attempts).\n        *   Remember Me functionality (if implemented).\n        *   Password complexity requirements (if implemented).\n        *   Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts (if implemented).\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Static Test Data**: For smoke tests, use a small set of predefined valid and invalid user credentials. These credentials should be stored securely and managed centrally.\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data (Future)**: For regression tests, consider using dynamic test data generation to cover a wider range of scenarios.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a Page Object Model to represent the login page and its elements. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   **Example**:\n        *   `LoginPage.java`: Contains methods for interacting with the login page elements (e.g., `enterUsername()`, `enterPassword()`, `clickLoginButton()`, `clickForgotPasswordLink()`).\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Represents the home page after successful login.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous loading of elements or changes in state. This will reduce flakiness caused by timing issues.\n    *   **Example**: Poll for the presence of the \"Welcome\" text on the home page after login.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Future)**: Explore self-healing techniques to automatically recover from broken locators. This can be achieved using AI-powered tools or custom implementations.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **`/` (Root Path)**: This is the primary entry point to the login page.\n    2.  **`/index.php/auth/login`**: This is the explicit URL for the login page.\n    3.  **`/index.php/auth/requestPasswordResetCode`**: This is the URL for the \"Forgot Password\" functionality.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **HTTP Status Code**: Verify that all pages return an HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility**: Verify that all required elements (username field, password field, login button, logo, copyright text, social media icons) are visible on the login page.\n    *   **Text Verification**: Verify the presence of key text elements, such as \"Username\", \"Password\", \"Forgot your password?\", and the copyright text.\n    *   **Successful Login**: Verify that a successful login redirects the user to the home page and displays a \"Welcome\" message (or equivalent).\n    *   **Failed Login**: Verify that an error message is displayed when attempting to log in with invalid credentials.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the OrangeHRM login page. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the login page is functional, reliable, and provides a positive user experience. This document will be reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in the application or business requirements."
