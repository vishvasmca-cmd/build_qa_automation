  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: OrangeHRM Login Page (Smoke Test)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the OrangeHRM login page, focusing on smoke testing to ensure the core functionality is operational. This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable automated test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** OrangeHRM is a SaaS-based Human Resource Management (HRM) system. The login page is the entry point to the entire application. Failure here prevents access to all other functionalities.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A malfunctioning login page results in:\n    *   **High Impact:** Prevents users from accessing the system, disrupting HR operations.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Erodes trust in the system's reliability.\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Indirectly impacts productivity and potentially SLA breaches.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Verification of all login page elements (username, password, login button, logo, social media icons, forgot password link).\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials (one user).\n        *   Navigation to the \"Forgot Password\" page.\n        *   Visibility of social media icons.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed negative login testing (invalid credentials, password policies).\n        *   Testing of functionalities beyond the login page (employee management, reporting, etc.).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the login page is accessible and core elements are functional.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Page Load Verification:** Verify the login page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Element Visibility:** Verify the presence and visibility of:\n            *   OrangeHRM Logo\n            *   Username field\n            *   Password field\n            *   Login button\n            *   \"Forgot your password?\" link\n            *   Social media icons (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube)\n        3.  **Successful Login:** Login with a valid, pre-defined user account.\n        4.  **Forgot Password Navigation:** Click the \"Forgot your password?\" link and verify navigation to the password reset page.\n        5.  **Social Media Icon Visibility:** Verify that all social media icons are visible on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy):** This will be defined in a separate regression test strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use a single, pre-defined valid user account for the successful login test. This account should be dedicated for testing purposes and have stable credentials.\n    *   **Data Storage:** Store the username and password in a secure configuration file (e.g., environment variables) accessible by the test framework.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement POM to represent the login page as a Page Object. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Language:** [Choose language based on team expertise, e.g., Python with Selenium, Java with Selenium, JavaScript with Playwright/Cypress].\n    *   **Assertion Library:** [Choose assertion library based on language, e.g., PyTest, JUnit, Chai].\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_until` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Element Locators:** Use robust element locators (e.g., IDs, CSS selectors with specific attributes) that are less prone to changes. Avoid relying solely on XPath, which can be brittle.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page URL:** `https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/`\n    2.  **Forgot Password Page URL:** (Dynamically obtained by clicking the \"Forgot your password?\" link)\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify HTTP 200 OK for all page loads.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that all required elements are visible on the page (logo, fields, buttons, links, icons).\n    *   **Successful Login:** Verify that after successful login, the user is redirected to the main dashboard page.\n    *   **Forgot Password Navigation:** Verify that clicking the \"Forgot your password?\" link redirects the user to the password reset page.\n    *   **Social Media Icons:** Verify that the social media icons are visible and clickable (although the click action itself is not validated in this smoke test).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots for failed test cases to aid in debugging.\n    *   Integrate test execution with a CI/CD pipeline for automated execution on every build.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the OrangeHRM login page. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure a stable and reliable login experience for users."
