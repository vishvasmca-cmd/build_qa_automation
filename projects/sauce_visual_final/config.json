  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. My task is to create a comprehensive Master Test Strategy document for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing, before any automation begins. This document will guide the entire engineering team.\n\nHere's the Markdown report:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** General E-commerce (Simulated)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n**User Goal:** Log in and check the first product price.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo.com, while a demo application, simulates a typical e-commerce platform.  The core business functionalities include:\n\n*   **Login/Authentication:** Secure user access.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying and filtering products.\n*   **Product Details:** Viewing individual product information.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding and managing items.\n*   **Checkout Process:** Completing the purchase.\n\nGiven the user goal (Log in and check the first product price), we will prioritize testing the login functionality and the product catalog display.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of Saucedemo.com functionalities, even in a demo environment, can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Credibility:**  A broken demo reflects poorly on the underlying technology and testing practices.\n*   **Misleading Results:**  If the application malfunctions, users may draw incorrect conclusions about its capabilities.\n*   **Blocked Demos:** Critical failures can prevent successful demonstrations of the platform.\n\nTherefore, a robust regression testing strategy is crucial to ensure the application's stability and reliability.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** Login, Logout, Password Reset (if applicable).\n*   **Product Catalog:** Display of products, filtering, sorting.\n*   **Product Details Page:** Display of product information (name, description, price, image).\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and updating items.\n*   **Checkout Process:** Entering shipping and payment information, order confirmation.\n*   **User Profile:** (If applicable) Viewing and updating user information.\n*   **All elements related to the user goal: \"Log in and check the first product price.\"**\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing, etc.\n*   **Accessibility Testing:**  (Unless specifically mandated)\n*   **Advanced Security Testing:** Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning (beyond basic OWASP Top 10 checks).\n*   **Integration with external services:** (Unless explicitly defined)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will verify the most critical functionalities after each build.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Verify the application is reachable (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  Verify the login page loads successfully.\n    3.  Verify a user can successfully log in with valid credentials (\"standard_user\", \"secret_sauce\").\n    4.  Verify the inventory page loads after successful login.\n    5.  Verify at least one product is displayed on the inventory page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionalities.\n\n*   **Authentication:**\n    *   **Positive:** Login with valid credentials for all user roles (if applicable).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Invalid username.\n        *   Invalid password.\n        *   Locked out user.\n        *   Empty username and password fields.\n        *   SQL Injection attempts in username/password fields (basic).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Very long username/password strings.\n        *   Special characters in username/password.\n\n*   **Product Catalog:**\n    *   **Positive:**\n        *   Verify all products are displayed.\n        *   Verify product details are displayed correctly (name, description, price, image).\n        *   Verify filtering and sorting functionality (if available).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Attempt to filter with invalid criteria (if applicable).\n        *   Verify error handling for missing product images.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Large number of products.\n        *   Products with very long names or descriptions.\n\n*   **Product Details Page:**\n    *   **Positive:**\n        *   Verify product details are displayed correctly.\n        *   Verify \"Add to Cart\" button functionality.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Attempt to access a non-existent product.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Product with a very long description.\n\n*   **Shopping Cart:**\n    *   **Positive:**\n        *   Add products to the cart.\n        *   Remove products from the cart.\n        *   Update product quantities.\n        *   Verify cart total is calculated correctly.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Attempt to add more products than available in stock.\n        *   Enter invalid quantities.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Large number of items in the cart.\n\n*   **Checkout Process:**\n    *   **Positive:**\n        *   Complete the checkout process with valid shipping and payment information.\n        *   Verify order confirmation page.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Enter invalid shipping information (e.g., invalid zip code).\n        *   Enter invalid payment information (e.g., invalid credit card number).\n        *   Attempt to proceed without entering required information.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Very long shipping addresses.\n\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on all input fields (SQL Injection, XSS).\n    *   Verify sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers) are not exposed in the UI or network traffic.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  A set of predefined usernames and passwords (e.g., \"standard_user\", \"secret_sauce\").\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Generated data for fields like shipping addresses and credit card numbers (using libraries or mock data).\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a separate configuration file or database.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Language:**  [Choose a language based on team expertise - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript].\n*   **Testing Framework:** [Choose a testing framework - e.g., JUnit, pytest, Mocha].\n*   **Assertion Library:** [Choose an assertion library - e.g., AssertJ, Chai].\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with explicit waits) to handle asynchronous operations and element loading.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n    *   **Self-Healing:**  Explore self-healing techniques to automatically locate elements that have changed their locators.\n*   **Environment Stability:** Ensure the test environment is stable and consistent.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nGiven the user goal (\"Log in and check the first product price\"), the autonomous agent should explore these pages/flows first:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  `https://www.saucedemo.com/`\n2.  **Inventory Page:** (After successful login)\n3.  **First Product Details Page:** (Click on the first product on the inventory page)\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Login Page:**\n    *   HTTP 200 OK.\n    *   \"Username\" and \"Password\" input fields are present.\n    *   \"Login\" button is present.\n*   **Inventory Page:**\n    *   HTTP 200 OK.\n    *   \"Products\" text is visible.\n    *   At least one product is displayed.\n*   **First Product Details Page:**\n    *   HTTP 200 OK.\n    *   Product name, description, and price are visible.\n\n**Success Definition:** All verification criteria are met, and the user can successfully log in and view the price of the first product.\n\n```\n"
