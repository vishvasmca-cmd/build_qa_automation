  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: E-commerce Product Search and Detail View\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the product search and detail view functionality of the e-commerce application located at `https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/`. This strategy will guide all testing efforts, ensuring a robust and reliable user experience.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nThis e-commerce application allows users to search for products and view their details. This is a critical user flow as it directly impacts product discovery and potential sales. Any failures in this area can lead to:\n\n*   **Lost Revenue**: Users unable to find desired products will likely abandon the site.\n*   **Brand Reputation Damage**: A buggy or unusable search and product detail experience will negatively impact the brand.\n*   **Customer Frustration**: A poor user experience can lead to dissatisfaction and churn.\n\nTherefore, this functionality is considered **P0 (Priority Zero)**, requiring thorough testing.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nThe primary risks associated with the product search and detail view functionality include:\n\n*   **Incorrect Search Results**: The search engine returns irrelevant or no results for valid queries.\n*   **Broken Product Pages**: Product pages fail to load, display incorrect information (e.g., price, description), or have broken images.\n*   **Performance Issues**: Slow search response times or slow loading of product pages.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerabilities that allow malicious actors to inject code or access sensitive product data.\n*   **Accessibility Issues**: The website should be usable by people with disabilities.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Search Functionality:**\n    *   Keyword search\n    *   Category search\n    *   Auto-suggestions\n    *   Filtering and sorting\n    *   No results handling\n*   **Product Detail Page:**\n    *   Product name, description, price, and images\n    *   Availability and stock levels\n    *   Reviews and ratings\n    *   Related products\n    *   Add to cart functionality\n    *   Social sharing\n    *   Zoom functionality\n*   **Performance**: Load times, responsiveness.\n*   **Responsiveness**: Compatibility with various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n*   **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Payment gateway integration (covered in a separate payment testing strategy)\n*   Order management (covered in a separate order management testing strategy)\n*   Advanced SEO testing\n*   Backend server infrastructure testing (covered by DevOps)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThis suite validates the core functionality is operational after each build. It is designed to be quick and efficient.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify the search bar is present on the homepage.\n    *   Search for a popular product (e.g., \"Laptop\").\n    *   Verify that search results are displayed.\n    *   Click on a product in the search results.\n    *   Verify that the product detail page loads successfully.\n    *   Verify that basic product information (name, price, image) is displayed on the product page.\n*   **Goal:** To quickly confirm that the fundamental search and product detail functionality is working.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThis comprehensive suite ensures that new changes haven't negatively impacted existing functionality.\n\n*   **Search Functionality:**\n    *   **Positive Testing:**\n        *   Search with valid keywords.\n        *   Search by category.\n        *   Use auto-suggestions.\n        *   Apply filters and sorting options.\n        *   Verify the number of products displayed per page is correct.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Search with invalid keywords (e.g., special characters).\n        *   Search with very long keywords.\n        *   Search for products that are out of stock.\n        *   Search with SQL injection attempts.\n        *   Empty search queries.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Search with keywords containing spaces or hyphens.\n        *   Search with multiple keywords.\n        *   Search performance under heavy load (concurrency testing).\n*   **Product Detail Page:**\n    *   **Positive Testing:**\n        *   Verify all product details are displayed correctly.\n        *   Verify that images load correctly.\n        *   Verify that reviews and ratings are displayed.\n        *   Verify that related products are displayed.\n        *   Verify \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n        *   Verify zoom functionality.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Attempt to access product pages with invalid product IDs.\n        *   Check for broken links.\n        *   Attempt XSS attacks through product descriptions or reviews.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Product pages with a large number of reviews.\n        *   Product pages with long descriptions.\n        *   Product pages with multiple images.\n*   **Performance Testing:**\n    *   Measure search response times under normal and peak load.\n    *   Measure product page load times.\n*   **Responsiveness Testing:**\n    *   Verify that the search results and product detail pages are displayed correctly on different screen sizes and devices.\n*   **Accessibility Testing:**\n    *   Verify that the site is navigable using keyboard only.\n    *   Verify proper use of ARIA attributes.\n    *   Verify sufficient color contrast.\n    *   Verify image alt text.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data**: Predefined datasets for core products and categories.  Stored in CSV or JSON files, and used for repeatable tests like searching for specific known products.\n*   **Dynamic Data Generation**: Generate random data for negative tests (e.g., invalid keywords, long descriptions). Libraries like Faker.js (or similar) should be integrated for this.\n*   **Database Interaction**: When appropriate, directly query the database to verify data consistency (e.g., stock levels, product details).\n*   **Data Refresh**: Implement a mechanism to refresh the test data periodically to prevent staleness.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM)**: The framework MUST follow the Page Object Model design pattern.  This separates page elements and interactions into reusable page objects, improving maintainability and reducing code duplication.\n*   **Language**: Suggest using a widely adopted language like JavaScript (with Playwright or Cypress), Python (with Selenium), or Java (with Selenium). The team should be proficient in the chosen language.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitForElementToBeVisible`) to handle dynamically loaded elements and asynchronous operations. Avoid hardcoded waits.\n*   **Self-Healing Locators**: Implement a strategy for self-healing locators (e.g., using multiple locators for the same element and automatically updating them if one fails).\n*   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests (e.g., network issues). Limit the number of retries to prevent masking real issues.\n*   **Test Isolation**: Ensure that tests are independent and do not rely on each other's state. This prevents cascading failures.\n*   **Environment Management**: Use separate test environments to avoid interference with production data.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage Search Bar**: Input various keywords (common products, categories, special characters).\n2.  **Category Pages**: Navigate to different category pages (e.g., \"Laptops\", \"Cameras\").\n3.  **Product Detail Pages**: Access product pages from search results and category pages.  Prioritize products with many reviews or variations.\n4.  **Filtered Search Results**: Apply different filters (price, brand, rating) and sorting options.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes**:  Verify that all requests return a successful HTTP status code (200 OK). Redirects (3xx) should be validated as correct. Errors (4xx, 5xx) indicate failures.\n*   **Page Content**:  Verify that key elements are present and displayed correctly. For example:\n    *   Search results page: Verify the number of results displayed.\n    *   Product detail page: Verify the product name, price, description, and images.\n*   **Database Validation**: Periodically validate the data being displayed on the UI matches the database records to avoid data integrity issues.\n*   **Error Messages**:  Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or failed operations.\n*   **Accessibility**: Check for accessibility issues and make sure content follows the W3C guidelines (WCAG).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the product search and detail view functionality of the e-commerce application. Adhering to this strategy will ensure high-quality and reliable software that meets the needs of our users."
