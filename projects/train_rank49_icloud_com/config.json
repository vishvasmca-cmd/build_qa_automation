  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: iCloud.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis:\n\niCloud.com provides cloud storage, personal data management, and access to Apple's suite of web applications. Its business criticality stems from:\n\n*   **Data Integrity:** Ensuring user data is stored and retrieved accurately.\n*   **Accessibility:** Guaranteeing users can access their data and applications reliably.\n*   **Security:** Protecting user data from unauthorized access and breaches.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile:\n\nFailure of iCloud.com can lead to:\n\n*   **Data Loss:** Potential loss or corruption of user data.\n*   **Service Disruption:** Inability for users to access their data and applications.\n*   **Security Breaches:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and data.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of user trust and negative impact on Apple's brand.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope:\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Website launch and initial page load.\n*   Identification of key UI elements on the landing page:\n    *   Login button/link\n    *   Signup/Get Started button/link\n    *   \"Try for Free\" or similar promotional button/link\n    *   Any 5 distinct buttons/links on the landing page\n    *   2 distinct links on the landing page\n    *   2 distinct menu bars on the landing page\n*   Verification of the presence and visibility of these elements.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Clicking or interacting with any of the identified UI elements.\n*   Login functionality.\n*   Signup/Account creation process.\n*   Any functionality beyond the initial landing page.\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS verification).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n*   Mobile device testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity):\n\nThe smoke suite will focus on verifying the basic health of the iCloud.com website.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Website Launch and Basic UI Verification**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the iCloud.com website loads successfully and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to `https://icloud.com`.\n        2.  Verify that the page loads within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        3.  Verify the presence and visibility of the following elements:\n            *   Login button/link\n            *   Signup/Get Started button/link\n            *   \"Try for Free\" or similar promotional button/link\n            *   Any 5 distinct buttons/links on the landing page\n            *   2 distinct links on the landing page\n            *   2 distinct menu bars on the landing page\n    *   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully, and all specified UI elements are present and visible.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite:\n\n*N/A - This is a smoke test strategy only.* A regression strategy will be defined separately.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy:\n\n*   **Data Requirements:** This smoke test does not require any specific test data. It focuses solely on UI element presence and visibility.\n*   **Data Handling:** N/A\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation:\n\nWhile this is a smoke test, adopting a Page Object Model (POM) structure from the outset will improve maintainability and scalability for future regression testing.\n\n*   **Page Objects:** Create a `HomePage` Page Object representing the iCloud.com landing page. This object should contain locators for all the UI elements identified in the testing scope (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Test Cases:** Test cases should interact with the `HomePage` Page Object to perform verifications.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** If elements are not immediately visible, use polling assertions with a reasonable timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) to allow for asynchronous loading.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to verify their presence.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets:\n\nThe autonomous agent (if applicable) should focus on the following:\n\n*   **Target URL:** `https://icloud.com`\n*   **Primary Focus:** Identifying all buttons, links, and menu bars on the landing page.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria:\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code is returned when accessing `https://icloud.com`.\n    *   The page title contains \"iCloud\".\n    *   The specified UI elements (Login, Signup, Try for Free, 5 buttons/links, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present and visible on the page.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error code (e.g., 404, 500) is returned.\n    *   The page fails to load within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 10 seconds).\n    *   Any of the specified UI elements are missing or not visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing smoke tests on iCloud.com. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on critical functionality and ensuring the website's basic health. This document will be updated as the testing effort evolves and expands."
