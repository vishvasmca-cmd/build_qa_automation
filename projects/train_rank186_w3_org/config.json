  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: W3.org Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the W3.org website smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the website.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** W3.org is a non-profit organization focused on web standards. While not directly revenue-generating, its availability and core functionality are critical for maintaining its reputation and providing access to essential resources for web developers worldwide.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the W3.org website could lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Inability to access web standards information can negatively impact W3.org's credibility.\n    *   **Reduced Accessibility:** Hinders developers from accessing crucial resources, potentially slowing down web development progress.\n    *   **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose confidence in W3.org as a reliable source of information.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar) buttons (5 total).\n        *   Presence and accessibility of 2 links.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the W3.org homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Button Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons related to Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar calls to action).\n        3.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for a smoke test.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on element presence rather than data input.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   While a full Page Object Model (POM) might be overkill for this simple smoke test, consider a lightweight structure to promote maintainability. Define locators (CSS selectors, XPaths) for the key elements (buttons, links, menu bars) in a central location. This will make updates easier if the website's structure changes.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (wait-and-retry) when verifying the presence of elements. This accounts for potential delays in element loading.  A reasonable timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) should be sufficient.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to capture and log any exceptions encountered during the test execution.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://w3.org):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 (OK)\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"W3C\" or \"World Wide Web Consortium\"\n    *   **Button Presence:**\n        *   Element is present in the DOM.\n        *   Element is visible on the page.\n    *   **Link Presence:**\n        *   Element is present in the DOM.\n        *   Element is visible on the page.\n    *   **Menu Bar Presence:**\n        *   Element is present in the DOM.\n        *   Element is visible on the page.\n*   **Success Criteria:** All verification criteria for all test cases must pass for the smoke test to be considered successful. A failed smoke test indicates a critical issue that requires immediate attention."
