  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: x.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the x.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** x.com is a general web application. The business criticality lies in ensuring core functionalities like website launch, user authentication (Login/Signup), and key call-to-action elements are operational.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of these core functionalities can lead to significant user frustration, loss of potential users, and damage to the brand's reputation.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Presence and visibility of Login/Signup/GetStarted/Try for Free (or similar) buttons.\n        *   Presence and visibility of 2 links.\n        *   Presence and visibility of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu bars (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully in the browser.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar button is present and visible.\n        4.  **Call-to-Action Button Presence (x3):** Verify the presence and visibility of three additional call-to-action buttons (e.g., \"Try for Free,\" \"Learn More,\" etc.).\n        5.  **Link Presence (x2):** Verify the presence and visibility of two distinct links on the page (e.g., \"About Us,\" \"Privacy Policy\").\n        6.  **Menu Bar Presence (x2):** Verify the presence and visibility of two distinct menu bars (e.g., top navigation, footer navigation).\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for Smoke Testing. Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on UI element presence and website accessibility.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** While this is a smoke test and doesn't require extensive automation, a basic Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended for future scalability. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for element to be visible) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for website launch in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: Focus on the main landing page after website launch.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200.\n    2.  **Button/Link/Menu Bar Presence:** Element is present in the DOM and is visible (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()` returns true).\n    3.  **No errors in the browser console.**\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for Smoke Testing the x.com website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the core functionality of the application is verified effectively."
