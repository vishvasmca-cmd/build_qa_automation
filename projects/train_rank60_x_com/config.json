  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: X.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the X.com website. It serves as the blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** X.com is a general web application. While the specific business model isn't provided, we can assume user engagement and content delivery are critical.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure to load the website, access key features, or find core navigation elements will result in immediate user frustration, loss of potential engagement, and damage to brand reputation.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of Login/Signup/GetStarted/Try for Free (or similar) buttons (at least 5).\n        *   Presence and accessibility of at least 2 links.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of at least 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicking).\n        *   Specific content verification (beyond presence).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially, focus on desktop).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Negative testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully.\n        2.  **Button Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons related to Login, Signup, Get Started, or similar calls to action.\n        3.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Data Strategy:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on the presence of elements, not their functionality.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars. This will improve maintainability and readability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitForElementVisible`) to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts (e.g., 5-10 seconds) to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n        *   Page Title: Contains \"X\" or relevant branding.\n    *   **Button Presence:**\n        *   At least 5 elements with tag name \"button\" or \"a\" (with appropriate styling) are present and visible.\n        *   Text content of buttons includes variations of \"Login\", \"Sign Up\", \"Get Started\", \"Try for Free\".\n    *   **Link Presence:**\n        *   At least 2 elements with tag name \"a\" are present and visible.\n    *   **Menu Bar Presence:**\n        *   At least 2 elements with tag name \"nav\" or \"ul\" are present and visible.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for any failures, including screenshots and relevant logs.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for Smoke Testing the X.com website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality of the application is verified effectively and efficiently."
