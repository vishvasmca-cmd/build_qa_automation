This plan prioritizes core functionality and provides clear instructions for mining and verification.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Chime Website Smoke Tests\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the test plan for conducting smoke tests on the Chime website (https://www.chime.com). The purpose of these tests is to quickly verify the critical functionalities of the website and ensure its basic operability. This plan is designed to be executed by autonomous testing agents.\n\n**2. Domain Information & Analysis**\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.chime.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Banking (FinTech)\n*   **Business Goal:** Chime provides online banking services focused on accessibility and user-friendliness. Their key value propositions include no hidden fees, early direct deposit, and automatic savings features.\n*   **Testing Focus:** This smoke test suite will focus on ensuring the website is live, the primary navigation is functional, and a core user onboarding flow (account creation) is accessible.\n*   **Assumptions:**\n    *   The test environment is stable and accessible.\n    *   No specific user accounts are required for the initial smoke tests (pre-login).\n    *   Website content is dynamic and subject to change. Tests should be resilient to minor content variations where possible.\n\n**3. Smoke Test Suite Definition**\n\nThe smoke test suite comprises the following key tests:\n\n**3.1. Test Case 1: Website Availability Check**\n\n*   **Description:** Verifies that the Chime website is accessible and returns a successful HTTP status code.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.chime.com.\n    2.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200 (OK).\n*   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully, and the HTTP status code is 200.\n\n**3.2. Test Case 2: Core Navigation Functionality**\n\n*   **Description:** Checks that the main navigation links are present and lead to the expected pages.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.chime.com.\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu (e.g., using an `aria-label` attribute like \"Main Navigation\" or a CSS selector targeting the header).\n    3.  Identify the following links within the main navigation:\n        *   \"Pricing\"\n        *   \"About Us\"\n        *   \"Help Center\"\n    4.  Click each link and verify that the page loads successfully (HTTP 200). Validate the URL changes to the expected destination. (e.g. Clicking \"Pricing\" should navigate to a URL containing \"/pricing\")\n*   **Expected Result:** All specified navigation links are present, clickable, and redirect to the correct pages.\n\n**3.3. Test Case 3: Core User Flow - \"Get Started\" Button**\n\n*   **Description:** Simulates a new user attempting to start the account creation process.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.chime.com.\n    2.  Verify the hero headline contains the text \"Banking that has your back\".\n    3.  Locate the \"Get Started\" button (identify using text content or appropriate `aria-label`).  Prioritize buttons prominently displayed on the homepage.\n    4.  Click the \"Get Started\" button.\n    5.  Verify that clicking the button redirects the user to the account creation page (URL should contain \"/signup\" or a similar keyword).\n*   **Expected Result:** The \"Get Started\" button is present, clickable, and redirects the user to the account creation page. The hero headline is correctly displayed.\n\n**4. Strategic Mining Instructions**\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize the following elements and pages for mining relevant information for testing:\n\n*   **Homepage (/)**:\n    *   **Hero Section:** Extract the main headline text for verification (Test Case 3).\n    *   **Navigation Menu:** Identify all links within the main navigation for Test Case 2. Pay attention to `aria-label` attributes or semantic HTML (e.g., `<nav>`).\n    *   **\"Get Started\" Button:**  Locate the button using its text content or `aria-label`.  Inspect its `href` attribute to understand the target URL.\n*   **Pricing Page (/pricing):**\n    *   Verify page content loads correctly from navigation.\n*   **About Us Page (/about):**\n    *   Verify page content loads correctly from navigation.\n*   **Help Center Page (/help):**\n    *   Verify page content loads correctly from navigation.\n*   **Account Creation Page (/signup or similar):**\n    *   Verify page content loads correctly after clicking the \"Get Started\" button.\n\n**5. Test Environment**\n\n*   The tests should be executed in a Chrome browser with default settings.\n*   The agent should use a screen resolution of 1920x1080.\n\n**6. Reporting**\n\n*   The autonomous agent should generate a report summarizing the results of each test case, including:\n    *   Test Case ID and Description\n    *   Status (Pass/Fail)\n    *   Any error messages encountered\n    *   Screenshots of any failed tests\n\n**7.  Future Considerations**\n\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to include mobile responsiveness checks.\n*   Incorporate accessibility testing to ensure compliance with WCAG guidelines.\n*   Add tests for core functionality within the logged-in user experience (once login is implemented in the testing framework).\n*   Consider API testing for core backend functionalities.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for autonomous agents to perform smoke tests on the Chime website. It prioritizes key functionalities and provides clear instructions for mining and verification. Remember to adapt and refine this plan as the website evolves."
