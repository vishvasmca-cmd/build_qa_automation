  "master_plan": "# Intuit.com - Master Test Strategy (Smoke Testing)\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Intuit.com is a critical business application providing financial and tax solutions. Failure can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal issues.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. System unavailability or critical functionality failure directly impacts revenue, customer trust, and regulatory compliance.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, 5 Buttons, 2 Links, 2 Menu Bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of any links or buttons.\n        *   Negative testing (invalid inputs, error handling).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to `https://intuit.com`. Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible on the page.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button is present and visible on the page.\n        5.  **Button Count:** Verify at least 5 buttons are present and visible on the page.\n        6.  **Link Count:** Verify at least 2 links are present and visible on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Count:** Verify at least 2 menu bars are present and visible on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   While this is a smoke test, adopting a Page Object Model (POM) structure from the beginning will facilitate future test automation efforts. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators and interactions for the elements being tested.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., retry logic with a timeout) to handle potential timing issues during page load. This is especially important for elements that might load asynchronously.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for key elements to be present before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://intuit.com`):** Focus on the main landing page.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** Element is visible on the page (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()` in Selenium).\n    *   **Button/Link/Menu Bar Count:** Verify the number of elements found matches the expected count."
