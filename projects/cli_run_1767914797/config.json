  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the comprehensive test strategy for ParaBank (https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, ensuring a robust and reliable application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nParaBank is a demo website mimicking an online banking application. While not a live production system, failures can lead to:\n\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect balance displays, failed transactions.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Unauthorized access, data breaches (simulated).\n*   **Functional Defects:** Inability to perform core banking operations.\n*   **Trust Degradation:** Even in a demo environment, a broken application reflects poorly.\n\nGiven the simulation of financial transactions, core functionalities like account creation, login, fund transfer, and loan requests are deemed **P0 (Priority 0)**.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nThe primary risks associated with ParaBank are:\n\n*   **Financial Miscalculation:** Incorrect account balances or transaction amounts.\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** Unauthorized access to user accounts.\n*   **Data Exposure:** Leakage of personal or financial information.\n*   **Broken Functionality:** Inability to complete key banking operations.\n\nThe risk profile necessitates thorough testing, focusing on functionality, security, and data integrity.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Registration\n*   Login/Logout\n*   Account Creation (Checking/Savings)\n*   Fund Transfer\n*   Bill Payment (Simulated)\n*   Loan Request\n*   Account Details and History\n*   Customer Profile Updates\n*   All positive and negative scenarios related to the listed functionalities.\n*   Basic security checks (input validation).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Third-party Integrations (as it is a demo site)\n*   Performance Testing (load, stress) - unless specifically required\n*   Accessibility Testing (WCAG compliance) - unless specifically required\n*   Detailed Security Penetration Testing\n*   Database integrity checks (beyond verifying correct data display)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the bare minimum required to confirm basic system health.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to the home page and verify it loads successfully (HTTP 200, Page Title Verification).\n    2.  Attempt to log in with valid credentials for a pre-existing user (e.g., \"john\", \"demo\").  Verify successful login and redirection to the account summary page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will be a comprehensive set of tests covering all in-scope functionalities.\n\n*   **Registration:**\n    *   Successful registration with valid data.\n    *   Error handling for invalid data (e.g., missing fields, invalid email).\n    *   Duplicate username handling.\n*   **Login/Logout:**\n    *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n    *   Failed login with invalid credentials (username, password, account lock).\n    *   Logout functionality.\n    *   Session management (timeout, concurrent logins).\n*   **Account Creation:**\n    *   Creating checking and savings accounts.\n    *   Validating initial deposit amounts.\n    *   Handling invalid account types or initial deposit amounts.\n*   **Fund Transfer:**\n    *   Successful transfer between accounts.\n    *   Insufficient funds handling.\n    *   Transfer to non-existent account handling.\n    *   Zero or negative transfer amount handling.\n*   **Bill Payment (Simulated):**\n    *   Successful bill payment.\n    *   Invalid payee account number handling.\n    *   Zero or negative payment amount handling.\n*   **Loan Request:**\n    *   Successful loan request with valid details.\n    *   Loan request rejection based on credit score or income.\n    *   Handling invalid loan amounts or down payments.\n*   **Account Details and History:**\n    *   Correct display of account details (balance, type).\n    *   Accurate transaction history.\n*   **Customer Profile Updates:**\n    *   Successful update of profile information.\n    *   Validation of input fields (e.g., phone number, address).\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid data inputs (e.g., special characters in names, negative amounts).\n    *   Boundary value analysis (min/max values for amounts, lengths of fields).\n    *   Simultaneous requests (concurrency - e.g., two transfers at the same time).\n    *   Attempted SQL injection and XSS attacks in input fields.\n    *   Network failures (simulated timeouts during transactions).\n    *   Empty state handling (e.g., no accounts available).\n\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS.\n    *   Password complexity requirements.\n    *   Session management and timeout handling.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** A set of pre-defined user accounts with known balances will be created for core regression tests. This ensures consistency and predictability.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generated data (e.g., random account numbers, names, addresses) will be used for registration and negative testing scenarios. This helps cover a wider range of possible inputs.\n*   **Data Management:**  A dedicated test data management strategy is not necessary for this demonstration website.  However, consider having a method to easily reset the database to a known state before running tests.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n**Page Object Model (POM)** will be used.\n\n*   **Reasoning:** POM promotes maintainability and reusability of test code.  It encapsulates UI elements and their interactions within Page Objects, making tests more readable and less prone to breakage due to UI changes.\n*   **Structure:** Each major page (e.g., HomePage, LoginPage, AccountSummaryPage, TransferFundsPage) will have a corresponding Page Object class.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with appropriate timeouts for elements that may take time to load (e.g., after a transaction).\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Employ explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are present and interactable before performing actions.\n    *   **Self-Healing (If Possible):** Explore self-healing techniques where the framework automatically retries failed actions or locates elements using alternative locators.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and log meaningful error messages.\n*   **Test Retries:** Implement a mechanism to automatically retry failed tests a limited number of times.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize the following pages/flows for exploration:\n\n1.  **Registration Page:**  Explore all input fields and variations of data.\n2.  **Login Page:** Test valid and invalid login scenarios.\n3.  **Account Summary Page:** Verify the display of account information.\n4.  **Transfer Funds Page:** Test transfers between different accounts.\n5.  **Request Loan Page:** Test various loan amounts and down payments.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return HTTP 200 (OK) status codes.\n*   **Element Presence:**  Verify the presence of key UI elements (e.g., labels, buttons, text fields) on each page.\n*   **Text Verification:** Verify that expected text is displayed on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, confirmation messages after a transaction).\n*   **Data Integrity:** Verify that data is correctly displayed and updated (e.g., account balances, transaction history).\n*   **Error Message Handling:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or failed operations.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing ParaBank. Regular review and updates are essential to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness."
