  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Rubicon Project Website (Smoke Testing)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Rubicon Project website (https://rubiconproject.com). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The Rubicon Project operates in the advertising technology space. Website availability and basic functionality are crucial for brand reputation, lead generation, and potential client engagement.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core website functions (e.g., inability to load the site, broken links, inaccessible login) can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the company's technical capabilities.\n    *   **Lost Leads:** Potential clients may be unable to learn about the company or contact sales.\n    *   **Reduced Engagement:** Existing clients may experience frustration if they cannot access resources or support.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of any button or link.\n        *   Clicking or interacting with any element beyond verifying its presence.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Negative testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health and accessibility of the Rubicon Project website.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the homepage (https://rubiconproject.com) loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button or link.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button or link.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element:** Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" button or link.\n        5.  **Button Element 4:** Verify the presence of a fourth button (e.g., \"Contact Us\", \"Learn More\").\n        6.  **Button Element 5:** Verify the presence of a fifth button (e.g., \"Request a Demo\").\n        7.  **Link Element 1:** Verify the presence of a link in the footer.\n        8.  **Link Element 2:** Verify the presence of a link in the header.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1:** Verify the presence of a main menu bar.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2:** Verify the presence of a secondary menu bar (e.g., a navigation bar within a specific section).\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for smoke testing.*  A regression suite will be defined later for more comprehensive testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent the Rubicon Project website. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class representing the homepage.\n        *   Within the `HomePage` class, define elements (e.g., `loginButton`, `signupLink`, `menuBar`) as Page Objects.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays.  This will prevent false failures due to elements not being immediately visible.\n    *   **Example:** Instead of `Assert.IsTrue(loginButton.Displayed)`, use:\n\n```csharp\n    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));\n    IWebElement loginButton = wait.Until(SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers.ExpectedConditions.ElementIsVisible(By.Id(\"loginButtonId\")));\n    Assert.IsTrue(loginButton.Displayed);\n```\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://rubiconproject.com):**  Focus on the initial page load and identification of key elements in the header, footer, and main content area.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   The website loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n        *   All specified elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars) are present on the page.\n        *   Elements are visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS or other means).\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   The website fails to load (HTTP error codes, timeout).\n        *   Any of the specified elements are missing or not visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Rubicon Project website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that critical website functionality is verified quickly and efficiently."
