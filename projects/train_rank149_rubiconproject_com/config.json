  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Rubicon Project Website (Smoke Testing)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Rubicon Project website (https://rubiconproject.com). This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable automated testing suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The Rubicon Project operates in the advertising technology (AdTech) domain. Website availability and core functionality are critical for business operations, partner relationships, and revenue generation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website or core functionalities can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Inability for partners to access the platform and manage campaigns.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust from partners and potential clients.\n    *   **Operational Disruption:** Inability to onboard new partners or manage existing accounts.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functional testing of the platform.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially).\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar button is present.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar button is present.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify a fourth button is present.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify a fifth button is present.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a link is present.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify a second link is present.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify a second menu bar is present.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for initial smoke testing. This section is for future expansion.)\n    *   **Objective:** Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.\n    *   **To be defined later, but will include:**\n        *   Login functionality.\n        *   Signup/Account creation.\n        *   Navigation through key platform sections.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For the initial smoke tests, no specific test data is required. The tests focus on UI element presence.\n    *   For future regression tests, a combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used. Static data will cover common scenarios, while dynamic data will handle edge cases and boundary conditions.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent web pages as objects, encapsulating their elements and actions. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Language:** Python with Selenium or JavaScript with Playwright are recommended due to their strong community support and rich feature sets.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_until_element_is_present`) to handle potential timing issues and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to synchronize test execution with the application's behavior.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using relative locators) to automatically adjust to minor UI changes.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://rubiconproject.com):** Focus on identifying the Login, Signup/Get Started, and Try for Free buttons, links and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code is returned.\n    *   **UI Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links and menu bars are present on the page (visible and interactable).\n    *   **No Exceptions:** The test execution should not encounter any unhandled exceptions or errors.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate clear and concise test reports indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Provide detailed error messages and screenshots for failed tests.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust and reliable automated testing suite for the Rubicon Project website. It will be reviewed and updated as the application evolves and new requirements emerge."
