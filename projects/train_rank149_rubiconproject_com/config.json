  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Rubicon Project Website (Smoke Testing)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Rubicon Project website (https://rubiconproject.com). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The Rubicon Project operates in the advertising technology (AdTech) space. Website availability and basic functionality are crucial for brand reputation, lead generation, and potential client engagement.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website's core functions (e.g., inability to access key pages, broken links) can lead to:\n    *   Loss of potential leads and business opportunities.\n    *   Damage to brand reputation and credibility.\n    *   Increased customer support inquiries.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key navigation elements (menus, links, buttons).\n        *   Existence of Login/Signup/GetStarted (or equivalent) entry points.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of any specific feature or service.\n        *   Performance testing (load times, scalability).\n        *   Security testing (vulnerability scanning, penetration testing).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (beyond a single, primary browser - e.g., Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Negative testing (invalid inputs, error handling).\n        *   Clicking and validating the functionality of the identified buttons and links.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key navigation elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website (https://rubiconproject.com) loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element:** Verify a \"Login\" button or link is present on the homepage or a readily accessible navigation menu.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" \"Try for Free,\" or equivalent button or link is present on the homepage or a readily accessible navigation menu.\n        4.  **Button Identification (5):** Identify and verify the presence of five distinct buttons on the homepage or readily accessible navigation menus.\n        5.  **Link Identification (2):** Identify and verify the presence of two distinct links on the homepage or readily accessible navigation menus.\n        6.  **Menu Bar Identification (2):** Identify and verify the presence of two distinct menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for smoke testing.* A regression suite will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** While a full-fledged framework might be overkill for a simple smoke test, consider a lightweight Page Object Model (POM) structure even for this initial phase. This will facilitate future expansion into more comprehensive testing.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` object representing the Rubicon Project homepage.\n    *   Within the `HomePage` object, define methods to locate the required elements (Login button, Signup button, other buttons, links, menus).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., waiting for an element to be present for a short duration) to handle potential timing issues during page load.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial website load in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://rubiconproject.com):** Primary focus for identifying all required elements.\n    2.  **Header/Navigation Bar:** Secondary focus for identifying Login/Signup and other key buttons/links.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the Rubicon Project logo or website title.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menus are present on the page and are visible (not hidden by CSS).\n    *   **Success:** All test cases pass, indicating the website is accessible and core navigation elements are present."
