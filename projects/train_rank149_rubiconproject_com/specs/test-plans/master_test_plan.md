# Test Plan: train_rank149_rubiconproject_com

## Scope

This test plan covers the basic functionality of the rubiconproject.com website, focusing on identifying key elements like buttons, links, and menu bars without interacting with them.

## Test Suites

This test plan includes a Smoke Suite and a Regression Suite.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The Smoke Suite is designed to verify the core functionality of the website. The following checklist was applied when creating the Smoke Suite:

1.  **Critical Paths:** Focus on the most important user flows (e.g., finding key elements on the homepage).
2.  **Core Business Logic:**  Verify that the fundamental elements of the website are present and accessible.
3.  **No Negative Testing:**  The smoke tests do not include negative scenarios.
4.  **No Complex Edge Cases:**  The smoke tests avoid complex or unusual scenarios.
5.  **Minimal Test Steps:**  Each smoke test should have a minimal number of steps to reduce execution time.
6.  **Independent Tests:**  Smoke tests should be independent of each other to avoid cascading failures.
7.  **Fast Execution:**  Smoke tests should execute quickly to provide rapid feedback.
8. **Happy Path**: Only tests the happy path.

### Regression Suite

The Regression Suite will include more comprehensive tests to cover various scenarios and edge cases. This suite will be developed in subsequent iterations.

## Test Cases

The test cases are defined in the feature files below.
