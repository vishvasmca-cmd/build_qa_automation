# Test Plan for train_rank166_vecdnlb_com

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the train_rank166_vecdnlb_com project. The project involves testing the functionality of a general web application, focusing on identifying key UI elements such as buttons and links.

## 2. Scope

The testing will cover the core functionality of the application, including:

*   Identifying and verifying the presence of buttons.
*   Identifying and verifying the presence of links.
*   Identifying and verifying the presence of menu bars.

## 3. Test Strategy

The testing will be conducted using a combination of smoke and regression testing.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite will focus on verifying the core functionality of the application. The following checklist will be applied:

1.  **Critical Paths:**  Verify the main navigation path.
2.  **Core Business Logic:** N/A - The current scope is UI element identification, not business logic.
3.  **Positive Testing:** Focus on successful identification of UI elements.
4.  **No Negative Testing:** No negative tests will be included in the smoke suite.
5.  **No Complex Edge Cases:**  Simple identification of elements.
6.  **Fast Execution:** The smoke suite should be quick to execute.
7.  **Build Acceptance:**  Passing smoke tests are required for build acceptance.
8.  **Limited Scope:** Only cover the most essential functionality.

### Regression Suite Strategy

The regression suite will cover a broader range of functionality, including edge cases and error handling. This will be developed in future iterations.

## 4. Test Environment

The tests will be executed in a standard web browser environment (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## 5. Test Deliverables

*   Test Plan Document
*   Gherkin Feature Files
*   Test Execution Reports

## 6. Test Schedule

The testing will be conducted in parallel with the development process.
