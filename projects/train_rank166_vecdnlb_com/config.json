  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Website Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** https://vecdnlb.com\n**Business Domain:** General Web Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the vecdnlb.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The application is a general web application. While specific business criticality is unknown, a functioning website is crucial for brand presence, user acquisition, and potential business operations.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or critical elements to function can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** A non-functional website creates a negative first impression.\n    *   **Lost Opportunities:** Potential customers may abandon the site if it's broken.\n    *   **Reduced User Engagement:** Existing users may be unable to access information or services.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic functionality.\n        *   Loading of the homepage and key elements.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of specified buttons and links.\n        *   Presence of specified menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicking).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid inputs).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Mobile device testing (initially).\n        *   Database validation.\n        *   API testing.\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present on the page.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button is present on the page.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Generic x2):** Verify the presence of any two other distinct buttons on the page.\n        6.  **Link Presence (Generic x2):** Verify the presence of any two distinct links on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (x2):** Verify the presence of two distinct menu bars on the page.\n    *   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for smoke tests, as we are only verifying the presence of elements.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the website's pages and elements. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class to represent the vecdnlb.com homepage.\n        *   Within the `HomePage` class, define elements (buttons, links, menu bars) as properties.\n        *   Use locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading. This will reduce flakiness.  Example:  Instead of immediately asserting `element.isDisplayed()`, poll for a short period (e.g., 5 seconds) until the element is displayed.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Consider for future):** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically recover from minor changes in the UI.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: Start by exploring the root URL (https://vecdnlb.com).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify the HTTP status code is 200 (OK) for the homepage.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of the specified buttons, links, and menu bars using appropriate locators.\n    *   **No Exceptions:** The test execution should not throw any unhandled exceptions.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate a clear and concise test report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots or videos of failing test cases to aid in debugging.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the vecdnlb.com website. It will be reviewed and updated as needed to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the project."
