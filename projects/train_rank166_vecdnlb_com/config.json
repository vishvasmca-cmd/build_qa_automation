  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Website Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://vecdnlb.com\n**Business Domain:** General Web Application\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThis website appears to be a general web application, potentially offering services or information. The core business criticality lies in ensuring the website is accessible, navigable, and that key entry points (Login, Signup) are functional.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the website to load or critical elements to function can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of potential customers:** If users cannot access the site or sign up, they may go to competitors.\n*   **Damage to brand reputation:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the organization.\n*   **Loss of revenue (if applicable):** If the website is used for sales or lead generation, downtime directly impacts revenue.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Website launch and accessibility.\n*   Identification of Login, Signup/GetStarted, and any other 3 prominent buttons.\n*   Identification of 2 prominent links.\n*   Identification of 2 menu bars.\n*   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n*   Basic HTTP status code verification (200 OK for the main page).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Clicking on any buttons or links.\n*   Form submission or data validation.\n*   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature.\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n*   Mobile device testing (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will focus on verifying the basic health of the website.\n\n**Test Cases:**\n\n1.  **Website Load Test:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the website loads successfully.\n    *   **Steps:** Navigate to https://vecdnlb.com.\n    *   **Expected Result:** HTTP status code 200 OK is returned, and the website content is displayed.\n2.  **Login Button Presence:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the Login button is present on the page.\n    *   **Steps:** Inspect the page source or rendered HTML.\n    *   **Expected Result:** A button element with text \"Login\" (or similar) is found.\n3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the Signup/GetStarted button is present on the page.\n    *   **Steps:** Inspect the page source or rendered HTML.\n    *   **Expected Result:** A button element with text \"Signup\", \"Get Started\", or similar is found.\n4.  **Button Presence (3 Additional):**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the presence of 3 other prominent buttons on the page.\n    *   **Steps:** Inspect the page source or rendered HTML.\n    *   **Expected Result:** 3 distinct button elements with relevant text are found.\n5.  **Link Presence (2):**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the presence of 2 prominent links on the page.\n    *   **Steps:** Inspect the page source or rendered HTML.\n    *   **Expected Result:** 2 distinct anchor (`<a>`) elements with `href` attributes are found.\n6.  **Menu Bar Presence (2):**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the presence of 2 menu bars on the page.\n    *   **Steps:** Inspect the page source or rendered HTML.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Two distinct `nav` or `ul` elements (or similar) that appear to represent menu structures are found.\n\n### 2.2 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators and methods for interacting with elements on the home page (buttons, links, menus).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  For element presence checks, use polling assertions with a reasonable timeout (e.g., 5 seconds). This allows the page to fully load before the assertion fails.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to ensure elements are present and visible before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should focus on the following areas:\n\n*   **Entire Home Page (https://vecdnlb.com):** Scan the entire page source for button, link, and menu elements.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP status code 200 OK for the main page.\n    *   All specified buttons, links, and menu bars are found on the page.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP status code other than 200 OK.\n    *   Any of the specified buttons, links, or menu bars are not found on the page within the defined timeout.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the smoke testing of the website. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical aspects of the application to ensure its basic functionality and availability."
