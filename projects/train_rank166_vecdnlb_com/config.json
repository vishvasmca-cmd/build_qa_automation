  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Website Smoke Test - vecdnlb.com\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the initial smoke testing of the vecdnlb.com website. It serves as the blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the test automation and execution efforts.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The website appears to be a general web application. Without further information, we assume a standard risk profile associated with website availability and basic functionality.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website to load or critical elements to be present results in loss of potential user engagement and brand reputation damage.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading.\n        *   Presence of key UI elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, 5 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu bars (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation (e.g., specific styling, responsiveness).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the website is accessible and the core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"GetStarted\" button is present on the page.\n        4.  **Five Button Presence:** Verify at least 5 other buttons are present on the page.\n        5.  **Two Link Presence:** Verify at least 2 links are present on the page.\n        6.  **Two Menu Bar Presence:** Verify at least 2 menu bars are present on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this initial smoke test. A full regression suite will be defined later.\n*   **Data Strategy:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. We are only verifying the presence of elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   Implement a basic Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   Create a `BasePage` object representing the common website structure.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` object extending `BasePage` to represent the specific elements on the homepage.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible`) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the initial website load to handle transient network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: The primary target for element discovery.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the page. Use `element.isDisplayed()` or equivalent.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clearly report any failures, including the specific element that was not found.\n    *   Include screenshots of the page in case of failure.\n*   **Automation Priority:** Automate the smoke test suite as the highest priority. This suite should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to provide immediate feedback on build stability."
