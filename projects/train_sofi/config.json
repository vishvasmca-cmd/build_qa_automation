  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan designed to guide autonomous agents in performing smoke tests on the SoFi website (https://www.sofi.com).  This plan focuses on ensuring the website is up, core navigation functions, and a critical user flow is operational.\n\n# Master Test Plan: SoFi Website Smoke Tests\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the test plan for smoke testing the SoFi website (https://www.sofi.com). The primary goal is to ensure the website is functional, accessible, and key user flows are operational after deployments or infrastructure changes.  This plan focuses on quickly identifying critical issues that prevent users from accessing core functionality.\n\n**2. Domain Information & Analysis**\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.sofi.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Banking and Financial Services. SoFi offers a range of products including loans, investments, and banking services.\n*   **Target Audience:**  Young professionals and individuals seeking modern financial solutions.\n*   **Key Website Goals:**\n    *   Acquire new customers for various financial products.\n    *   Provide existing customers with access to account management and support.\n    *   Establish brand trust and authority in the financial space.\n*   **Testing Focus:** Given the domain, testing will prioritize functionality related to account creation, product information access, and overall website stability. Security considerations are paramount but are outside the scope of these basic smoke tests.\n\n**3. Scope**\n\nThis test plan covers the following aspects of the SoFi website:\n\n*   Website availability and load.\n*   Core navigation (main menu).\n*   A critical user flow: Navigating to the homepage, verifying a specific headline, and initiating the account creation process (clicking \"Get Started\").\n\n**4. Out of Scope**\n\nThe following are explicitly excluded from this smoke test plan:\n\n*   Detailed functional testing of specific financial products (e.g., loan applications, investment platforms).\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, etc.).\n*   Security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Browser compatibility testing beyond a single modern browser (e.g., Chrome).\n*   Mobile testing.\n\n**5. Test Environment**\n\n*   **Browser:** Latest version of Google Chrome.\n*   **Operating System:**  [Agent Choice].\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection.\n\n**6. Smoke Test Suite Definition**\n\nThis suite contains essential tests to verify the basic health and functionality of the SoFi website.\n\n**6.1. Test Case 1: Website Availability**\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the SoFi website is accessible and returns a successful HTTP status code.\n*   **Pre-conditions:** None.\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.sofi.com.\n    2.  Verify that the page loads successfully.\n*   **Expected Result:** The website loads within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 5 seconds) and returns a 200 OK HTTP status code.\n\n**6.2. Test Case 2: Core Navigation**\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the main menu links are functional and navigate to the correct pages.\n*   **Pre-conditions:** Website is accessible (SMOKE-001 passed).\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  Locate the main navigation menu.  Identify all top-level menu items (e.g., \"Loans,\" \"Invest,\" \"Credit Card,\" \"Banking\").\n    2.  For each menu item:\n        a. Click the menu item.\n        b. Verify that the page navigates to a relevant URL (check URL structure and keywords).\n        c. Verify that the page content is related to the menu item clicked.\n*   **Expected Result:** All main menu links navigate to the correct pages without errors. Page content should logically relate to the clicked menu item.\n\n**6.3. Test Case 3: Core User Flow - Homepage to \"Get Started\"**\n\n*   **Test ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Description:** Verify the ability to navigate to the SoFi homepage, find the hero headline and a \"Get Started\" button, and click the button.\n*   **Pre-conditions:** Website is accessible (SMOKE-001 passed).\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.sofi.com.\n    2.  Verify that the hero headline contains the text \"Do more with your money\". Use `contains` operator, allowing for variations in punctuation or capitalization.\n    3.  Locate the \"Get Started\" button on the homepage. Use a broad locator strategy to handle potential UI changes (e.g., search for a button with text containing \"Get Started\" or \"Sign Up\").\n    4.  Click the \"Get Started\" button.\n    5.  Verify that the page navigates to a registration or account creation page. (Check for URL keywords like \"register\", \"signup\", \"apply\").\n*   **Expected Result:** The headline is present and accurate. The \"Get Started\" button is clickable and redirects the user to a registration page.\n\n**7. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents**\n\nThese instructions guide the agent to prioritize specific elements and pages for efficient testing.\n\n*   **Prioritize Homepage Elements:** The agent should aggressively mine locators for the hero headline and \"Get Started\" button on the homepage. Use multiple locator strategies (CSS selectors, XPath, text-based search) to ensure resilience to UI changes.\n*   **Navigation Menu:**  The agent should identify the main navigation menu and extract all top-level menu items and their corresponding URLs.  Pay attention to dynamic menus or menus that change based on user login status (though the smoke test doesn't require login).\n*   **URL Verification:** The agent should be able to extract the current URL after each navigation step and compare it to expected URL patterns or keywords.\n*   **Content Verification:** For Core Navigation, the agent needs to extract text content from the destination page and confirm relation to menu item text. Use cosine similarity or keyword matching on content blocks (e.g., a paragraph of text).\n*   **Error Handling:** The agent should be programmed to detect common HTTP errors (404, 500, etc.) and report them as test failures.  It should also be able to identify JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n*   **Dynamic Content:** Be aware of dynamic content that might change frequently (e.g., promotional banners).  Avoid hardcoding specific values for these elements. Focus on verifying the *presence* of the element rather than its exact content.\n\n**8. Test Data**\n\n*   No specific test data is required for these smoke tests.  The tests do not involve submitting forms or creating accounts.\n\n**9. Test Execution**\n\n*   These smoke tests should be executed automatically after each deployment or infrastructure change.\n*   The test results should be reported clearly, indicating which tests passed and failed, along with any error messages or screenshots.\n\n**10. Reporting**\n\n*   A concise report should be generated after each test execution, summarizing the results.\n*   The report should include:\n    *   Test execution date and time.\n    *   Overall test status (Pass/Fail).\n    *   Detailed results for each test case (Pass/Fail/Skipped).\n    *   Error messages and screenshots (if applicable).\n    *   Links to detailed test logs.\n\n**11. Success Criteria**\n\n*   All smoke tests must pass for the deployment to be considered successful.\n*   If any smoke tests fail, the deployment should be rolled back or investigated immediately.\n\n**12. Future Considerations**\n\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to include more critical user flows as needed.\n*   Integrate the smoke tests into a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.\n*   Consider adding basic performance monitoring to the smoke tests (e.g., page load times).\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for performing automated smoke tests on the SoFi website.  By following these guidelines, autonomous agents can efficiently verify the website's core functionality and prevent critical issues from reaching users."
