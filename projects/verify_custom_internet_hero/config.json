  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: the-internet.herokuapp.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the application hosted at `https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/`. It serves as a blueprint for all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and a robust quality assurance process.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe application `the-internet.herokuapp.com` is a practice website containing various common web application elements and challenges. While not a production business application, it serves as a valuable tool for practicing and demonstrating testing techniques. The \"Form Authentication\" functionality, specifically, simulates a common user login scenario.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the application, in this context, does not result in direct financial loss or data breach. However, a poorly tested or unstable application can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Confidence:** Inability to reliably demonstrate testing techniques.\n*   **Incorrect Learning:** Misinterpretation of test results due to application instability.\n\nTherefore, while the business impact is low, the application's reliability is crucial for its intended purpose.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Form Authentication:**\n    *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n    *   Failed login with invalid credentials.\n    *   Logout functionality.\n    *   Error message validation.\n    *   Security considerations (basic input validation).\n*   **General Website Navigation:**\n    *   Basic navigation to other pages from the Form Authentication page.\n    *   Page load times.\n*   **Cross-browser compatibility** (limited to major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (beyond basic page load times).\n*   Load testing.\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   All other features of the website beyond Form Authentication and basic navigation.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the following critical path tests:\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Login**\n    *   Navigate to the Form Authentication page.\n    *   Enter valid credentials (`tomsmith/SuperSecretPassword!`).\n    *   Verify successful login (presence of success message).\n*   **Test Case 2: Page Load**\n    *   Navigate to the Form Authentication page.\n    *   Verify the page loads within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 3 seconds).\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage, including:\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Invalid Username:** Attempt login with an invalid username and valid password. Verify the appropriate error message is displayed.\n    *   **Invalid Password:** Attempt login with a valid username and invalid password. Verify the appropriate error message is displayed.\n    *   **Empty Fields:** Attempt login with empty username and password fields. Verify the appropriate error message is displayed.\n    *   **SQL Injection:** Attempt login with SQL injection strings in the username and password fields. Verify the application handles these inputs gracefully (no internal errors or data breaches).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   **Long Username/Password:** Attempt login with extremely long username and password strings.\n    *   **Special Characters:** Attempt login with usernames and passwords containing special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()_+`).\n    *   **Logout Functionality:** Verify the logout functionality correctly terminates the session and redirects the user to the login page.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   **Input Validation:** Verify that the application performs basic input validation to prevent common attacks like XSS and SQL injection.\n    *   **Error Message Handling:** Ensure error messages do not reveal sensitive information about the system.\n*   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n    *   **Post-Login Navigation:** After successful login, verify that the user can navigate to other pages on the website.\n*   **Validation Messages:**\n    *   Verify that all error messages are clear, concise, and informative.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** The valid credentials (`tomsmith/SuperSecretPassword!`) will be stored as static data within the test framework.\n*   **Dynamic Generation:** Invalid usernames and passwords will be dynamically generated using random string generation techniques. This ensures a diverse range of invalid inputs for negative testing.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nA Page Object Model (POM) architecture is highly recommended. This will promote code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n\n*   **LoginPage:** This page object will encapsulate all elements and actions related to the login page (e.g., username field, password field, login button, error messages).\n*   **SecureAreaPage:** This page object will encapsulate all elements and actions related to the secure area (the page displayed after successful login).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\nFlakiness is a common issue in automated testing. To mitigate this:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or conditions to be met before proceeding with the test. This will help to avoid timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that the test waits for a specific element or condition.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors (e.g., retrying failed actions, refreshing the page).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Form Authentication Page:** `https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login`\n2.  **Secure Area Page:** The page displayed after successful login.\n3.  **Logout Functionality:** The link/button used to log out of the application.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Login:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for the login request.\n    *   Presence of a success message on the Secure Area page (e.g., \"You logged into a secure area!\").\n    *   Absence of error messages.\n*   **Failed Login:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for the login request.\n    *   Presence of an error message on the login page (e.g., \"Your username is invalid!\").\n    *   Absence of a success message.\n*   **Page Load:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for the page request.\n    *   All page elements are visible and interactable.\n    *   Page load time is within an acceptable threshold (e.g., 3 seconds).\n"
