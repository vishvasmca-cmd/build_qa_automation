  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Workers.dev Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Workers.dev website smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the test automation and execution efforts.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Workers.dev provides serverless computing solutions. While a general web application, its core function is to attract and onboard new users. Failure to do so directly impacts business growth.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A failure in the core navigation and initial user experience (e.g., broken links, non-functional buttons) leads to:\n    *   **Loss of Potential Customers:** Users unable to navigate or sign up will likely abandon the site.\n    *   **Damage to Brand Reputation:** A buggy website reflects poorly on the technical capabilities of the company.\n    *   **Increased Support Costs:** Users may contact support for issues that could have been prevented through proper testing.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Presence and basic functionality (non-clickable) of key navigation elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, and any other 2 prominent buttons.\n        *   Presence of 2 prominent links.\n        *   Presence of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of each button/link (e.g., actual login process, signup form submission).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Any functionality beyond the initial page load and element presence.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key navigation elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present on the page.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button is present on the page.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify the presence of another prominent button (e.g., \"Contact Us\", \"Pricing\").\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify the presence of another prominent button (e.g., \"Documentation\", \"Blog\").\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify the presence of a prominent link (e.g., \"Terms of Service\", \"Privacy Policy\").\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify the presence of another prominent link (e.g., \"Careers\", \"About Us\").\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify the presence of a main menu bar.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify the presence of a secondary menu bar (e.g., footer menu).\n*   **Regression Suite (Not Applicable for Smoke Test):** A full regression suite will be defined later, focusing on the detailed functionality of each element.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on element presence, not data input.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the website's pages and elements. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` Page Object containing locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for element to be present) to handle potential timing issues during page load.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test failures due to transient network issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://workers.dev):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the page.  Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify the elements.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clearly report any test failures with detailed error messages and screenshots.\n    *   Prioritize fixing smoke test failures immediately, as they indicate critical issues.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the Workers.dev smoke test. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a stable and reliable website launch."
