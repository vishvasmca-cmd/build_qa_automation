  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Cloudflare.net - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Cloudflare.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** Cloudflare is a critical infrastructure provider for internet security and performance. Website availability and core functionality are paramount.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure of the Cloudflare website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust in Cloudflare's services.\n    *   **Business Disruption:** Inability for potential customers to access information and sign up.\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Reduced lead generation and potential customer acquisition.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar CTAs), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Verification of element presence (not functionality).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking or interacting with any elements (buttons, links, menu items).\n        *   Form submissions.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Cloudflare.net website loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element Check:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button or link.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Check:** Verify the presence of a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar call-to-action button or link.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element Check:** Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" or similar call-to-action button or link.\n        5.  **Button Count Check:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons on the page.\n        6.  **Link Count Check:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Count Check:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the page.\n    *   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for smoke testing.* A regression suite will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   Implement a lightweight framework using a Page Object Model (POM) structure. This will facilitate maintainability and scalability as testing expands.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `BasePage`: Contains common methods for interacting with the browser.\n        *   `HomePage`: Represents the Cloudflare.net homepage and contains locators for the elements being verified (Login button, Signup button, etc.).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions with reasonable timeouts to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately visible.\n    *   **Example:** Instead of `Assert.assertTrue(loginButton.isDisplayed())`, use a polling assertion that checks for the button's visibility over a period of 5 seconds.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**: The primary focus for element identification.\n    2.  **Header and Footer**: Inspect these areas for common elements like Login, Signup, and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch Success:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) is returned.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified elements (Login, Signup, Try for Free, buttons, links, menu bars) are present in the DOM (Document Object Model).\n    *   **No Functional Verification:** The tests should *only* verify the *presence* of the elements, not their functionality (clicking, navigation, etc.).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Cloudflare.net website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure a stable and reliable testing process."
