  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Cloudflare.net - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Cloudflare.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Cloudflare.net is a critical infrastructure provider for internet security and performance. Its website serves as a primary interface for customer acquisition, product information, and account management.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the Cloudflare.net website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust and credibility due to website unavailability or errors.\n    *   **Business Disruption:** Inability for potential customers to learn about services or sign up.\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Reduced sales and revenue due to impaired customer acquisition.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic accessibility.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual features and services.\n        *   Performance testing (load times, scalability).\n        *   Security testing (vulnerability assessments, penetration testing).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility beyond major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n        *   Mobile device testing.\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Cloudflare.net homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify another prominent button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify another prominent button is present and visible on the homepage.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a prominent link is present and visible on the homepage.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify another prominent link is present and visible on the homepage.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a main menu bar is present and visible on the homepage.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify another menu bar (e.g., footer menu) is present and visible on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for smoke testing)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for smoke testing, as it focuses on UI element presence.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Cloudflare.net homepage and its elements. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains methods to access and verify the presence of buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential delays in element loading. This will prevent false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Example:** Instead of `Assert.assertTrue(loginButton.isDisplayed())`, use a polling mechanism that checks for the button's visibility for a short period (e.g., 5 seconds) before failing.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage:** Focus the autonomous agent on the Cloudflare.net homepage.\n    *   **Header:** Specifically target the header section for menu bars and login/signup buttons.\n    *   **Footer:** Explore the footer for additional links and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for the homepage.\n        *   All specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the page.\n        *   No critical JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n        *   Missing or invisible UI elements.\n        *   Critical JavaScript errors that prevent the page from loading correctly."
