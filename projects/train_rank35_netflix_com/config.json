It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Netflix is a critical streaming service. Outages directly impact revenue, subscriber satisfaction, and brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failures can lead to significant financial loss, customer churn, and damage to brand trust.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page rendering.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic accessibility.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Menu navigation.\n        *   Form submission.\n        *   Video playback.\n        *   Account creation or login.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the core functionality of the Netflix website is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Netflix homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   Login button\n            *   Signup/GetStarted button\n            *   Try for Free button\n            *   Two additional buttons (identified dynamically during execution)\n            *   Two links (identified dynamically during execution)\n            *   Two menu bars (identified dynamically during execution)\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A (Smoke test only)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No test data is required for smoke testing, as no data entry or form submission is involved.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` Page Object containing locators for the target elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntilElementIsVisible()`) to handle potential loading delays.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://netflix.com):** Focus on identifying the specified buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and page title contains \"Netflix\".\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   Elements are present on the page (visible in the DOM).\n        *   Elements are of the correct type (e.g., `<button>`, `<a>`, `<nav>`).\n        *   Elements have appropriate text labels (e.g., \"Login\", \"Sign Up\").\n*   **Success Metrics:**\n    *   All smoke tests pass consistently.\n    *   Execution time is minimal (ideally under 2 minutes).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Netflix.com website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the stability and reliability of the core functionality."
