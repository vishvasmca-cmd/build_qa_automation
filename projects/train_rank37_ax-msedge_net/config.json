  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ax-msedge.net (Smoke Testing)\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for smoke testing the ax-msedge.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The ax-msedge.net website appears to be a general web application, potentially related to Microsoft Edge or a related service. The business criticality depends on the purpose of the website (e.g., marketing, support, downloads).\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website could lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** A broken website reflects poorly on Microsoft.\n    *   **Lost Opportunities:** Users unable to access information or services.\n    *   **Reduced Adoption:** Potential users may be deterred from using Microsoft Edge.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic attributes (e.g., text).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed functionality of any specific feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button is present.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify a fourth button is present (identify and name it).\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify a fifth button is present (identify and name it).\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a link is present (identify and name it).\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify a second link is present (identify and name it).\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify a second menu bar is present.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Not Applicable for Smoke):**  Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):**  While this is a smoke test, establishing a POM structure early is beneficial. Create a base `HomePage` object containing locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars. This will facilitate future regression testing.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitForElementVisible`) to handle potential loading delays.  A short timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) is sufficient for smoke tests.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits with expected conditions for element presence.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://ax-msedge.net):** This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Elements are visible on the page and contain the expected text (e.g., button text matches \"Login\"). Use `element.isDisplayed()` and `element.getText()` to verify.\n    *   **No Exceptions:** No JavaScript errors or unhandled exceptions occur during page load.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   A clear \"Pass/Fail\" status for each test case.\n    *   Screenshots on failure to aid in debugging.\n    *   Execution time for each test case.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the ax-msedge.net website. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, clear scope definition, and architectural best practices. This will ensure efficient and reliable testing, leading to a higher quality product."
