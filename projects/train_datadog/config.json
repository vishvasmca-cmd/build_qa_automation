  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: Datadog.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis Master Test Plan outlines the strategy for smoke testing Datadog's website (https://www.datadoghq.com). The primary goal is to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational and that key user flows are functioning correctly. This plan will guide the autonomous agents in mining, verifying, and structuring the test suite.\n\n## 2. Domain Information and Analysis\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.datadoghq.com\n*   **Business Domain:** SaaS (Software as a Service) - Cloud Monitoring\n*   **Primary Goal of Website:**\n    *   Attract new customers interested in cloud monitoring solutions.\n    *   Provide information about Datadog's services and products.\n    *   Enable users to sign up for trials and subscriptions.\n    *   Serve as a resource center for existing customers.\n*   **Key Areas of Interest for Testing:**\n    *   Homepage: Headline accuracy, key call-to-action buttons (e.g., \"Get Started\").\n    *   Navigation: Main menu links functionality.\n    *   Sign-up/Trial flow: Initiate the account creation process.\n*   **Risks:**\n    *   Broken links, especially in the navigation menu.\n    *   Incorrect or outdated information on the homepage (e.g., headline).\n    *   Non-functional \"Get Started\" button.\n\n## 3. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke suite will focus on quickly verifying the most critical aspects of the Datadog website.\n\n### 3.1. Test Case 1: Website Availability & Basic Navigation\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the Datadog website is accessible and that core navigation elements are functional.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Open the Datadog homepage (https://www.datadoghq.com).\n    2.  **Verification:** Verify that the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    3.  Locate the main navigation menu.\n    4.  **Verification:** Check that all top-level menu items are present (e.g., Products, Pricing, Resources, etc.).  No need to click, just confirm their existence in the DOM.\n\n### 3.2. Test Case 2: Homepage Headline Verification\n\n*   **Description:** Verify the accuracy of the main headline on the homepage.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Open the Datadog homepage (https://www.datadoghq.com).\n    2.  Locate the main hero headline element (typically an `<h1>` or `<h2>` element).\n    3.  **Verification:** Verify that the headline text contains the phrase \"Cloud monitoring as a service\".\n\n### 3.3. Test Case 3: \"Get Started\" Button Functionality (Happy Path)\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the \"Get Started\" button on the homepage is clickable and navigates the user to the registration page.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Open the Datadog homepage (https://www.datadoghq.com).\n    2.  Locate the \"Get Started\" button.\n    3.  **Action:** Click the \"Get Started\" button.\n    4.  **Verification:** Verify that the user is redirected to a registration or sign-up page.  Validate that the URL contains '/sign-up' or '/create-account'.\n\n## 4. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agent in identifying key elements and pages for testing.\n\n*   **Prioritized Elements:**\n    *   **Homepage Headline:** Instruct the agent to specifically target `<h1>` or `<h2>` elements within the main section of the homepage for headline verification. Use keywords like \"monitoring\" and \"service\" to validate the right element.\n    *   **\"Get Started\" Button:**  Instruct the agent to search for `<button>` or `<a>` elements with text containing \"Get Started\", \"Start Free Trial\", or similar phrases.  Prioritize buttons with prominent styling (e.g., a distinct background color).  Look at `aria-label` as well.\n    *   **Navigation Menu:** Instruct the agent to identify the main navigation element (likely a `<nav>` element with an `id` or `class` containing \"navigation\" or \"menu\").  Extract the text of all direct `<a>` children for verification.\n*   **Prioritized Pages:**\n    *   **Homepage (/)**: Critical for all smoke tests.\n    *   **Sign-up Page (/sign-up or /create-account):** Crucial for verifying the \"Get Started\" flow.  The agent needs to detect the URL after clicking the \"Get Started\" button.\n*   **Mining Strategy:**\n    *   Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) to quickly locate key page sections.\n    *   Prioritize elements with specific `id` or `class` attributes that suggest importance (e.g., \"hero-headline\", \"main-button\", \"primary-navigation\").\n    *   Use XPath or CSS selectors to target elements based on their text content (e.g., `//button[contains(text(), 'Get Started')]`).\n*   **Data Collection:** The agent should record the following:\n    *   Page load times for each tested page.\n    *   HTTP status codes for each page request.\n    *   Text content of key elements (headline, button text, navigation links).\n    *   URLs of redirected pages after button clicks.\n\n## 5. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:** Any (cross-platform testing)\n\n## 6. Test Execution and Reporting\n\n*   The autonomous agent will execute the test cases defined in Section 3.\n*   A detailed report will be generated, including:\n    *   Test case execution status (Pass/Fail).\n    *   Screenshots of any failed test cases.\n    *   Collected data from the mining process (e.g., page load times, HTTP status codes).\n    *   Logs of any errors encountered during test execution.\n\n## 7. Success Criteria\n\n*   All test cases in the smoke suite must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for conducting effective smoke tests on Datadog's website. By following these guidelines, the autonomous agents can efficiently identify and verify critical functionality, ensuring a high-quality user experience."
