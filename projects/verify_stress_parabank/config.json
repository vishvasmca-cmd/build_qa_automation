  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for ParaBank, a banking application. It will serve as the guiding document for all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and alignment with business objectives.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** The application falls within the banking domain, making data integrity, security, and accuracy of financial transactions paramount. Incorrect functionality can lead to financial loss for both the bank and its customers, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure in key areas (transactions, account access) results in:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect transfers, unauthorized access, incorrect interest calculations.\n    *   **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive customer data (PII, financial information).\n    *   **Trust Loss:** Loss of customer confidence and brand damage.\n    *   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Potential fines and legal repercussions (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   User Registration and Account Creation\n        *   Account Access and Management (Login, Logout, Account Overview)\n        *   Fund Transfers (Internal, External)\n        *   Bill Payments\n        *   Transaction History and Search\n        *   Customer Profile Management (Contact Info Update)\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance Testing (Load, Stress, Soak) - *This will be addressed in a separate performance test plan.*\n        *   Accessibility Testing (WCAG Compliance) - *This will be addressed in a separate accessibility test plan.*\n        *   Mobile App Testing (if applicable) - *Only web application is being addressed in this plan.*\n        *   Database Testing (Direct DB access) - *Covered implicitly via application layer tests.*\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis section details the specific testing approaches to be employed.  Given the user's goal, both smoke and regression test candidates are selected.\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core functionality of the application after each build or deployment.  A failed smoke test indicates a critical issue that must be addressed immediately.\n*   **Scope:** Minimal set of tests covering the most critical \"happy paths.\"\n*   **Smoke Test Candidates:**\n    *   **Successful Login:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n    *   **Account Overview Page Load:** Verify that the Account Overview page loads successfully after login and displays basic account information.\n    *   **Open New Account (Savings):** Verify a new saving account can be created.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Purpose:** To ensure that new changes have not introduced defects into existing functionality. This is a comprehensive suite that covers a wide range of scenarios.\n*   **Scope:**\n    *   **Functional Testing:**\n        *   **User Registration:**\n            *   Verify successful registration with valid data.\n            *   Verify error handling for invalid data (e.g., missing required fields, invalid email format, password strength).\n            *   Verify handling of existing usernames.\n        *   **Account Access:**\n            *   Verify Login with valid/invalid credentials.\n            *   Verify session timeout handling.\n            *   Verify Logout functionality.\n            *   Password Reset flow.\n        *   **Account Overview:**\n            *   Verify the display of all account details (balance, type, ID).\n            *   Verify links to transaction history.\n        *   **Fund Transfers:**\n            *   Verify internal fund transfers between accounts.\n            *   Verify transfer limits and insufficient funds handling.\n            *   Verify scheduling future transfers.\n        *   **Bill Payments:**\n            *   Verify bill payment to existing payees.\n            *   Verify adding new payees.\n            *   Verify payment scheduling.\n            *   Verify payment confirmation and history.\n        *   **Transaction History:**\n            *   Verify the display of transaction history for each account.\n            *   Verify filtering by date, amount, and type.\n            *   Verify downloading statements (PDF, CSV).\n        *   **Customer Profile Management:**\n            *   Verify updating contact information (address, phone, email).\n            *   Verify password change functionality.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid inputs for all fields (e.g., special characters, SQL injection attempts).\n        *   Attempting to transfer more funds than available.\n        *   Submitting forms with missing required fields.\n        *   Login attempts with incorrect credentials.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency: Multiple users accessing and modifying the same account simultaneously.\n        *   Network failures during transactions.\n        *   Empty states (e.g., no transaction history).\n        *   Boundary values (e.g., minimum and maximum transfer amounts).\n    *   **Security Testing:**\n        *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks:\n            *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n            *   Secure password storage.\n            *   Proper session management.\n    *   **Regression Test Candidates:**\n        *   Open New Account (Savings) - multiple accounts.\n        *   Click Accounts Overview - Verify new account visible.\n        *   Click the new account.\n        *   Click Transfer Funds.\n        *   Transfer $50 to new account.\n        *   Click Bill Pay.\n        *   Pay 'Electric Co' $100.\n        *   Find Transactions by Amount $50.\n        *   Update Contact Info 'Phone' to '555-0000'.\n        *   Logout.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Reusable data sets for common scenarios (e.g., valid usernames and passwords for different user roles).\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Data generated during test execution (e.g., unique account numbers, random transaction amounts).\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   A dedicated test data management system (if available) should be used to store and manage test data.\n    *   Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers) should be masked or encrypted.\n    *   Data cleanup procedures should be in place to ensure that test data does not pollute the production environment.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** **Page Object Model (POM)** is strongly recommended. This pattern promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability. Each page of the application should have a corresponding page object that encapsulates its elements and actions.\n*   **Technology Stack:**\n    *   Programming Language: Java or Python (based on team expertise)\n    *   Test Automation Framework: Selenium WebDriver, Cypress, or Playwright (evaluate based on project needs)\n    *   Assertion Library: JUnit, TestNG (Java) or Pytest (Python)\n    *   Reporting: Extent Reports, Allure Report\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading. This helps prevent false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically locate elements based on multiple attributes or strategies. If one locator fails, the framework should attempt to find the element using an alternative locator.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests. If a test fails due to a transient issue (e.g., network glitch), it should be automatically retried a few times before being marked as failed.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Always prefer explicit waits over implicit waits to improve test stability and reduce flakiness.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Execution Platform:** Tests should be executed on a dedicated test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.\n*   **Test Execution Tool:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, or similar CI/CD tool.\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Login Page:** Explore different login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials, forgotten password).\n    *   **Account Overview Page:** Explore different account types and transaction histories.\n    *   **Transfer Funds Page:** Explore different transfer amounts and recipient accounts.\n    *   **Bill Pay Page:** Explore different payee options and payment schedules.\n    *   **Update Contact Info:** Explore the various input fields for contact updates\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n        *   Expected elements and text are visible on the page.\n        *   Data is correctly saved and displayed.\n        *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n        *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n        *   Incorrect data display or storage.\n        *   JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n*   **Reporting:**  Detailed test reports should be generated after each test execution, including:\n    *   Number of tests executed.\n    *   Number of tests passed.\n    *   Number of tests failed.\n    *   Detailed error messages and stack traces for failed tests.\n    *   Screenshots or videos of failed tests.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing ParaBank.  It is a living document and will be updated as needed to reflect changes in the application, business requirements, or testing best practices."
