  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Plan for Sephora.com, focusing on smoke testing and aligning with the specified user goal.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Sephora.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://www.sephora.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce (Beauty and Cosmetics)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke Testing\n**Overall Objective:**  Ensure the core functionality of the Sephora website is operational and that users can successfully navigate the primary user flow. This plan focuses on critical path testing to identify major issues early in the development cycle.\n\n## 1. Domain Information & Analysis\n\nSephora.com is a leading e-commerce website in the beauty and cosmetics industry. It offers a wide range of products, including makeup, skincare, haircare, fragrances, and beauty tools. The website likely handles a high volume of traffic and transactions daily. Core functionalities include:\n\n*   **Product Browsing & Search:**  Ability to find products through categories, filters, and search.\n*   **Product Detail Pages:**  Comprehensive information about products, including descriptions, images, reviews, and pricing.\n*   **Shopping Cart & Checkout:**  Adding products to a cart, managing quantities, and completing the purchase process.\n*   **User Account Management:**  Registration, login, order history, saved addresses, and payment methods.\n*   **Promotions & Offers:**  Displaying and applying discounts, coupons, and promotional offers.\n*   **Store Locator:** Finding physical Sephora stores.\n\n**Key Considerations for Testing:**\n\n*   **High Availability:** The website needs to be highly available due to its e-commerce nature.\n*   **Performance:**  Page load times significantly impact user experience and conversion rates.\n*   **Security:**  Sensitive user data (payment information, personal details) needs robust security measures.\n*   **Responsiveness:**  The website must function correctly across various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones) and browsers.\n*   **Integration with Backend Systems:**  Seamless integration with inventory management, payment gateways, and shipping providers is crucial.\n\n## 2. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThis smoke suite focuses on verifying the essential functionality of the Sephora website. The goal is to quickly identify any major issues that prevent users from accessing the site or completing basic tasks.\n\n### 2.1. Basic Website Availability Check\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the Sephora.com homepage is accessible and returns a 200 OK HTTP status code.\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.sephora.com.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The homepage loads successfully within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., under 5 seconds).\n    *   The HTTP status code is 200 OK.\n\n### 2.2. Core Navigation Menu Check\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the main navigation menu links are functional.\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.sephora.com.\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu (e.g., containing categories like \"Makeup,\" \"Skincare,\" \"Hair,\" etc.).\n    3.  Click on each main category link.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   Each navigation link should redirect to the corresponding category page without errors.\n    *   The category page should load within an acceptable timeframe.\n\n### 2.3. Core Flow: Homepage Hero Section Verification & \"Shop Now\" Click\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Description:** Verify the hero section headline text and functionality of the 'Shop Now' button.\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.sephora.com.\n    2.  Locate the hero section on the homepage.\n    3.  Verify that the hero headline contains the text \"Let\u2019s beauty together\".\n    4.  Locate the \"Shop Now\" button within the hero section.\n    5.  Click the \"Shop Now\" button.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The hero headline text matches \"Let\u2019s beauty together\" exactly.\n    *   The \"Shop Now\" button is clickable and redirects to a relevant page (e.g., a featured products page or a new arrivals page). The page loads within an acceptable timeframe.\n\n## 3. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agents to prioritize specific elements and pages for deeper analysis beyond the smoke tests.\n\n*   **Homepage Hero Section:**\n    *   **Priority:** High\n    *   **Mining Instructions:**\n        *   Extract all text elements within the hero section (headlines, sub-headlines, descriptions).\n        *   Identify all interactive elements (buttons, links, forms).\n        *   Capture the URLs associated with each link and button.\n        *   Examine the images used in the hero section for broken links or slow loading times.\n        *   Find ALL variations of Hero section in different viewports\n\n*   **Main Navigation Menu:**\n    *   **Priority:** High\n    *   **Mining Instructions:**\n        *   Extract all category names and corresponding URLs.\n        *   Identify any dropdown menus and extract their contents (subcategories and links).\n        *   Analyze the structure of the menu for accessibility issues (e.g., proper ARIA attributes).\n        *   Capture screenshots of the menu in different states (e.g., open, closed, hovered).\n\n*   **Product Detail Pages (PDPs):**\n    *   **Priority:** Medium\n    *   **Mining Instructions:**\n        *   Find a variety of PDPs (e.g., best-selling items, new arrivals, products with different attributes like color/size).\n        *   Extract the product name, price, description, images, and available options.\n        *   Identify the \"Add to Cart\" button and its associated functionality.\n        *   Locate and analyze customer reviews and ratings.\n        *   Examine the related products section.\n\n*   **Search Functionality:**\n    *   **Priority:** Medium\n    *   **Mining Instructions:**\n        *   Test different search queries (e.g., specific product names, category keywords, brand names).\n        *   Analyze the search results page for relevance and accuracy.\n        *   Identify and extract any filters and sorting options.\n        *   Check for \"no results found\" scenarios and ensure a user-friendly message is displayed.\n\n*   **Footer:**\n     *   **Priority:** Low\n     *   **Mining Instructions:**\n        * Extract all links and text from the footer.\n        * Verify links are working\n\n## 4. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browsers:** Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest), Safari (latest), Edge (latest)\n*   **Operating Systems:** Windows 10/11, macOS, iOS, Android\n*   **Devices:** Desktop, Tablet, Mobile\n*   **Network Conditions:** Simulate different network speeds (e.g., fast, slow, offline).\n\n## 5. Reporting\n\n*   All test results should be clearly documented, including pass/fail status, execution time, and any error messages.\n*   Defects should be reported with detailed steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and relevant screenshots or videos.\n*   A summary report should be generated after each test run, highlighting the overall status of the application and any critical issues.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a foundation for smoke testing and strategic mining of the Sephora.com website. It will be updated and refined as the project progresses."
