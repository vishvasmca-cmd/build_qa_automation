  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: MTS.RU Website - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for smoke testing the MTS.RU website (https://mts.ru). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the initial testing efforts to ensure the core functionality and stability of the website.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** MTS.RU is a telecommunications company offering a wide range of services. Website availability and basic functionality are crucial for customer acquisition, service access, and brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the website's core functions (e.g., inability to access the site, find key navigation elements) can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Potential Customers:** Inability to sign up or explore services.\n    *   **Damage to Brand Reputation:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the company.\n    *   **Reduced Service Access:** Existing customers may be unable to manage their accounts.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key navigation elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, 5 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Detailed functionality of any specific service or feature.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially, focus on desktop).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key navigation elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website (https://mts.ru) loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button (or similar) is present on the page.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button (or similar) is present on the page.\n        5.  **Button Presence (General):** Verify the presence of 5 additional buttons on the page.\n        6.  **Link Presence (General):** Verify the presence of 2 links on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of 2 menu bars on the page.\n    *   **Data Strategy:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input.\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this specific \"smoke\" testing request, but included for completeness and future expansion)\n    *   **Objective:** N/A\n    *   **Test Cases:** N/A\n    *   **Data Strategy:** N/A\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for this smoke test. Consider using a simple assertion library with a browser automation tool (e.g., Selenium WebDriver with JUnit/TestNG or Playwright with Jest/Mocha).\n    *   While a full Page Object Model (POM) might be overkill for this initial smoke test, it's recommended to start structuring the tests with POM principles in mind for future expansion.  Create a basic `HomePage` class that encapsulates the locators for the elements being verified.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become present on the page, especially if the website has dynamic content loading. This helps avoid false failures due to timing issues.  A reasonable timeout (e.g., 5-10 seconds) should be used.\n    *   **Locator Strategy:** Use robust locator strategies (e.g., IDs, CSS Selectors) that are less likely to change with website updates. Avoid using fragile locators like XPath based on absolute position.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** The MTS.RU homepage (https://mts.ru).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the main page content (e.g., a heading or logo).\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the page.  Visibility can be verified using methods like `isDisplayed()` in Selenium.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   A clear pass/fail report should be generated after each smoke test execution.\n    *   Any failures should be investigated immediately and resolved before proceeding with further testing.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the MTS.RU website. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical functionalities to ensure the website's basic health and stability. This strategy will be reviewed and updated as the project evolves and new requirements emerge."
