  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: MTS.RU - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://mts.ru\n**Business Domain:** General Web (Telecommunications Provider)\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the initial smoke testing phase of the MTS.RU website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** MTS.RU is the primary online presence for a major telecommunications provider. Website availability and basic functionality are critical for customer acquisition, service information, and brand reputation.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure of the website's core functions can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Potential Customers:** Inability to sign up or explore services.\n    *   **Damage to Brand Reputation:** Negative user experience due to website unavailability.\n    *   **Increased Support Costs:** Customers contacting support for information readily available on the website.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key interactive elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n        *   Existence of Login/Signup/Get Started (or equivalent) entry points.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual features.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (initially, focus on desktop).\n        *   Clicking and navigating through the menu items.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key interactive elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the MTS.RU homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element Check:** Verify a \"Login\" button or link is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element Check:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or equivalent button/link is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element Check:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or equivalent button/link is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button Element Check (Additional 2):** Verify two more distinct buttons are present and visible on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Element Check (Additional 2):** Verify two more distinct links are present and visible on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Check (2):** Verify two distinct menu bars are present and visible on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this initial smoke test strategy)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Smoke Tests:** No specific test data is required for the initial smoke tests. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. Create a `HomePage` Page Object that encapsulates the locators and interactions for the MTS.RU homepage. This will improve maintainability and reusability of the tests.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with reasonable timeouts to handle potential delays in element loading. For example, instead of immediately failing if an element is not found, poll for its presence for a few seconds.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Consider for future phases):** Explore self-healing capabilities in the automation framework to automatically adapt to minor UI changes.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n\n    *   **Homepage (https://mts.ru):** This is the primary target for the smoke tests.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the MTS logo or a recognizable page title.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present in the DOM and visible on the page. Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify the elements.\n    *   **No Exceptions:** The test execution should not result in any unhandled exceptions or errors.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the initial smoke testing of the MTS.RU website. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a robust and maintainable test suite that effectively validates the core functionality of the application."
