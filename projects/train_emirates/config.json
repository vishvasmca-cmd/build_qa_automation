  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan for Emirates.com, designed to guide autonomous agents in performing smoke tests.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Emirates.com - Smoke Tests\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for smoke testing the Emirates.com website (https://www.emirates.com). The primary goal is to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational and that key user flows are functioning as expected. This plan will serve as a blueprint for autonomous agents to mine, verify, and structure the smoke test suite.\n\n**2. Domain Information**\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.emirates.com\n*   **Business Domain:** E-commerce (Airline booking and related services)\n*   **Primary Goal:** To provide users with the ability to research, book, and manage flights and related services (hotel, car rentals, etc.).  Also, to provide information about the Emirates brand and its offerings.\n*   **Key Functionality:**\n    *   Flight search and booking\n    *   Manage existing bookings\n    *   Check-in online\n    *   Emirates Skywards loyalty program\n    *   Information about destinations, services, and the Emirates experience.\n\n**3. Scope**\n\nThis Master Test Plan focuses solely on smoke testing. It will cover the most critical functionalities required for a basic user journey. More extensive functional, regression, performance, and security testing will be covered in separate test plans.\n\n**4. Test Objectives**\n\n*   Verify the website is accessible and loads correctly.\n*   Verify core navigation links are functional.\n*   Verify the ability to initiate a flight search.\n*   Confirm essential elements are present on the homepage.\n\n**5. Smoke Suite Definition**\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the following test cases:\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Website Availability & Basic Content**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the website is up and running and that basic content loads correctly.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.emirates.com.\n        2.  Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP status code 200).\n        3.  Verify the presence of the Emirates logo in the header.\n        4.  Verify the presence of the footer section.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The website loads without errors, and the logo and footer are visible.\n\n*   **Test Case 2: Core Navigation Links**\n    *   **Description:** Ensure core navigation links in the main menu are functional.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.emirates.com.\n        2.  Locate the main navigation menu (usually in the header).\n        3.  Click on the following links and verify they navigate to a valid page:\n            *   \"Plan\"\n            *   \"Book\"\n            *   \"Manage\"\n            *   \"Experience\"\n            *   \"Emirates Skywards\"\n\n    *   **Expected Result:** Each link navigates to a relevant page without errors.\n\n*   **Test Case 3: Happy Path - Homepage Headline and Flight Search Initiation**\n    *   **Description:** Verify the hero headline contains 'Fly better' and user can initiate a flight search.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.emirates.com.\n        2.  Verify the hero headline contains the text \"Fly better\".\n        3.  Locate the \"Search flights\" button.\n        4.  Click on the \"Search flights\" button.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The hero headline displays \"Fly better\". Clicking the \"Search flights\" button navigates the user to the flight search form (or expands the form on the same page).\n\n**6. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents**\n\nThe following instructions will guide the autonomous agents in identifying key elements and prioritizing their analysis:\n\n*   **Prioritize Homepage Elements:** The homepage is the entry point for most users. Focus on mining the following:\n    *   **Header:** Extract all navigation links, logo, and language/country selection elements.\n    *   **Hero Section:**  Locate the main headline and associated promotional content (images, videos). Identify and extract any call-to-action buttons within this section.\n    *   **Footer:** Extract all links, copyright information, and social media links.\n    *   **Flight Search Widget:** Identify the main flight search form (departure, destination, dates, number of passengers, class). Extract all input fields and buttons.\n\n*   **Navigation Menu:**  Specifically target the main navigation menu (usually in the header). Extract all top-level navigation links and their corresponding URLs.\n\n*   **\"Fly better\" Verification:** Agent must be able to find a headline on the main landing page which has the text \"Fly better\" regardless of the HTML tag it is contained within.\n\n*   **Dynamic Content:** Be aware that some elements, particularly in the hero section, may be dynamically loaded or change based on user location or other factors.  Design tests to handle these variations gracefully.\n\n**7. Test Data**\n\nNo specific test data is required for smoke tests. The focus is on verifying the functionality of the site itself, not on specific flight bookings.\n\n**8. Environment**\n\n*   The tests should be executed against the production environment (https://www.emirates.com).\n*   Tests should be run using a variety of browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure cross-browser compatibility.\n\n**9. Entry Criteria**\n\n*   The website (https://www.emirates.com) is accessible.\n\n**10. Exit Criteria**\n\n*   All smoke test cases pass.\n\n**11. Reporting**\n\n*   The autonomous agent should generate a clear and concise report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n*   The report should include any errors encountered during testing.\n\n**12. Future Considerations**\n\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to include other critical user flows, such as checking flight status or managing an existing booking.\n*   Integrate smoke tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure early detection of issues.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for creating a robust smoke test suite for Emirates.com. By following these guidelines, autonomous agents can effectively verify the core functionality of the website and ensure a positive user experience."
