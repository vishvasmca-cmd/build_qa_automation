  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Rahul Shetty Academy - Automation Practice\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Rahul Shetty Academy Automation Practice website (https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The application is a general web application providing a platform for practicing automation skills. While not directly tied to revenue generation, defects can impact user experience and learning.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **Low:** Financial loss is minimal.\n    *   **Medium:** Data breach risk is low, assuming no sensitive user data is collected.\n    *   **Medium:** Loss of user trust due to broken functionality can impact the platform's reputation.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All functionalities available on the website, including form submissions, UI interactions, alert handling, table data validation, and iframe interactions.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n        *   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n        *   Accessibility (basic checks).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n        *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n        *   Database testing (direct database queries).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Verify the basic health of the application after deployment.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  Verify the main page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  Verify the presence of key UI elements (e.g., header, footer, input fields).\n        3.  Verify the \"Practice\" section loads without errors.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Ensure that new changes haven't introduced regressions and that existing functionality remains intact.\n    *   **Focus Areas:**\n        *   **Negative Testing:**\n            *   Invalid input in form fields (e.g., special characters in name, invalid email format).\n            *   Submitting forms with missing required fields.\n            *   Attempting actions without proper authorization (if applicable).\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Handling of long text strings in input fields.\n            *   Testing with different character encodings.\n            *   Simulating network latency or failures during form submissions.\n            *   Testing with JavaScript disabled.\n        *   **Security:**\n            *   Basic input validation to prevent XSS attacks (e.g., try injecting `<script>` tags into input fields).\n            *   Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities (if the application interacts with a database).\n        *   **Specific Test Cases (Based on User Goal: \"Type in country, select valid option, and alert handle\"):**\n            1.  **Valid Country Selection:** Type a valid country (e.g., \"India\"), select it from the dropdown, and verify that the alert message contains the selected country.\n            2.  **Invalid Country Input:** Type an invalid country (e.g., \"XYZ\"), verify that no suggestions appear, and attempt to submit the form. Verify appropriate error handling (e.g., no alert appears, or an error message is displayed).\n            3.  **Partial Country Input:** Type a partial country name (e.g., \"Ind\"), select a suggestion, and verify the alert message.\n            4.  **Empty Country Input:** Leave the country field empty and attempt to submit the form. Verify appropriate error handling.\n            5.  **Alert Handling - Accept:** Verify that clicking \"OK\" on the alert dismisses it and allows further interaction with the page.\n            6.  **Alert Handling - Dismiss (if applicable):** If the alert has a \"Cancel\" button, verify that clicking it dismisses the alert.\n        *   **Data Strategy:**\n            *   **Static Data:** Use a combination of static and dynamic test data.\n            *   **Dynamic Generation:** For fields like names and email addresses, consider using dynamic data generation libraries (e.g., Faker) to create realistic and unique test data.\n            *   **Data Storage:** Store test data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON) for easy maintenance and reuse.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n    *   **Language:** Choose a suitable programming language (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript) based on team expertise and project requirements.\n    *   **Testing Framework:** Select a robust testing framework (e.g., Selenium WebDriver, Cypress, Playwright) that provides the necessary tools for browser automation, assertion handling, and reporting.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable, reducing flakiness due to timing issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests, allowing them to be re-executed a certain number of times before failing.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI-powered element locators) to automatically adapt to UI changes and reduce test maintenance effort.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Verify the basic layout and functionality of the homepage.\n    2.  **Practice Section:** Focus on the \"Practice\" section, including the input fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and alert handling.\n    3.  **Table Example:** Explore the table data and verify that it is displayed correctly.\n    4.  **Iframe Example:** Test the interaction with the iframe.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all requests return the expected HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK for successful requests).\n    *   **UI Element Visibility:** Ensure that all UI elements are displayed correctly and are interactable.\n    *   **Data Validation:** Verify that data is displayed correctly and that form submissions are processed as expected.\n    *   **Alert Handling:** Verify that alerts are displayed correctly and that the correct actions are performed when the user interacts with them.\n    *   **Error Messages:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed when invalid input is provided.\n    *   **Console Logs:** Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors or warnings.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the Rahul Shetty Academy Automation Practice website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure that the application is thoroughly tested and meets the required quality standards.\n"
