  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Rahul Shetty Academy Automation Practice Site\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nThe target application is a generic automation practice website. While not directly tied to a specific revenue-generating business, its stability and reliability are crucial for users learning and practicing automation skills. Failure impacts user experience and trust in the learning platform.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n*   **Low Financial Risk**: Direct financial loss due to failure is minimal.\n*   **Moderate Reputational Risk**: Repeated failures could damage the credibility of the platform as a reliable learning resource.\n*   **Low Data Breach Risk**: The application appears to handle limited user data, minimizing data breach concerns.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functional elements within the specified target URL (`https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/`).\n*   Input validation and error handling related to the country selection functionality.\n*   Alert handling scenarios, including acceptance and dismissal.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Responsive design testing for various screen sizes.\n*   Accessibility testing (basic checks for ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Extensive security penetration testing beyond basic input sanitization checks.\n*   Testing of external integrations or third-party services (if any).\n*   Mobile native app testing (if applicable).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\nThe smoke suite will verify the fundamental availability and operability of the application.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to the homepage (`https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/`).\n    2.  Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n    3.  Verify key UI elements are displayed (e.g., header, input fields, buttons).\n*   **Criteria for Success:** All tests must pass. Failure indicates a critical issue requiring immediate attention.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will cover a wide range of scenarios to ensure existing functionality remains intact after changes.\n\n#### 2.2.1 Negative Testing\n*   **Invalid Input:**\n    *   Attempt to enter non-alphabetic characters in the country input field.\n    *   Enter special characters or symbols.\n    *   Enter excessively long strings.\n*   **Boundary Values:**\n    *   Test with extremely short (one or two characters) and long strings to simulate different country names.\n*   **Timeouts (If Applicable):** Simulate network delays or timeouts while fetching country suggestions.\n\n#### 2.2.2 Edge Cases\n*   **Concurrency:** Simulate multiple users simultaneously interacting with the country selection feature.  (If the application has multi-user features).\n*   **Network Failures:**  Simulate intermittent network connectivity issues during the test.\n*   **Empty States:** Test the behavior when the input field is empty and the user attempts to trigger the alert.\n\n#### 2.2.3 Security (OWASP Top 10 Basics)\n*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Attempt to inject SQL code into the country input field.\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attempt to inject JavaScript code into the input field.\n*   **Input Sanitization:** Verify that the application properly sanitizes user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.\n\n#### 2.2.4 Alert Handling\n*   **Valid Selection:**\n    *   Type a valid country name.\n    *   Select a suggestion from the dropdown.\n    *   Verify the alert message is displayed correctly.\n    *   Accept the alert.\n*   **Invalid Selection:**\n    *   Type a country name that doesn't exist.\n    *   Attempt to trigger the alert without selecting a suggestion.\n    *   Verify an appropriate error message is displayed (either inline or in an alert).\n*   **Alert Dismissal:**\n    *   Verify the alert can be dismissed (either by accepting or canceling).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** Utilize a combination of static and dynamic test data.\n    *   **Static Data:**  Create a list of valid country names for positive testing and invalid country names for negative testing. Store this in a CSV or JSON file.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Consider generating random strings for edge cases and security testing (e.g., random SQL injection attempts).\n*   **Data Management:**  Implement a data-driven testing approach, where test data is easily configurable and maintainable.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to encapsulate the UI elements and interactions related to the target page. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous events and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement a basic self-healing mechanism to automatically locate elements even if their locators change slightly. This can involve using multiple locator strategies (e.g., ID, CSS selector, XPath) and prioritizing them based on reliability.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  This can involve re-running failed tests a limited number of times before marking them as failures.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\nFocus the autonomous agent's exploration on the following elements and flows:\n\n1.  **Country Input Field:** Explore various input combinations (valid, invalid, special characters) to understand validation rules.\n2.  **Suggestion Dropdown:**  Explore the dropdown behavior under different input scenarios (e.g., no suggestions, multiple suggestions).\n3.  **Alert Handling:**  Specifically target scenarios that trigger alerts (e.g., valid selection, invalid selection).  Try to find ways to bypass or manipulate the alert behavior.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return a 200 (OK) status code.\n*   **Element Presence:** Verify that key UI elements (input field, dropdown, alert) are present on the page.\n*   **Text Visibility:** Verify that expected text (e.g., alert message, error message) is visible on the page.\n*   **Alert Handling:** Verify that alerts can be accepted and dismissed as expected.\n*   **Error Messages:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input or unexpected scenarios."
