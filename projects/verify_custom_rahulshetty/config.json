  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Rahul Shetty Academy - Automation Practice\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Rahul Shetty Academy Automation Practice website (https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/). It serves as a blueprint for all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and high-quality delivery.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe application under test is a general web application providing a platform for practicing automation skills. While not a critical business application in terms of direct revenue generation, its reliability is crucial for user learning and engagement. Failure to function correctly can lead to a negative user experience and hinder the learning process.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Minimal direct financial loss.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Potential for negative reviews and loss of user trust if the application is unreliable or buggy.\n*   **Data Breach:** Low risk, but basic security checks are still necessary to prevent vulnerabilities.\n*   **User Frustration:** High risk if core functionalities are broken, leading to user frustration and abandonment.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities available on the website, including:\n    *   Input fields and associated validations.\n    *   Dropdown menus and selection options.\n    *   Alert handling.\n    *   Table interactions.\n    *   Radio button and checkbox functionalities.\n    *   Iframe handling.\n    *   Window handling.\n    *   Basic UI elements and their responsiveness.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   Basic security checks (OWASP Top 10).\n*   Performance testing (page load times).\n*   Accessibility testing (basic checks).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   In-depth performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Advanced security penetration testing.\n*   Mobile device testing (unless explicitly requested).\n*   API testing (unless APIs are directly exposed and critical).\n*   Detailed accessibility compliance (WCAG).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will verify the core functionality of the website.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Verify the website homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    2.  Verify the \"Practice\" page loads successfully.\n    3.  Verify the input field for country allows text input.\n    4.  Verify the dropdown list appears after typing in the input field.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of all functionalities.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid input in the country field (e.g., special characters, numbers).\n    *   Attempting to select an option from the dropdown without typing anything.\n    *   Submitting forms with missing required fields.\n    *   Entering excessively long text in input fields.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Rapidly typing and deleting text in the country field.\n    *   Simultaneous user interactions (if applicable).\n    *   Network latency and simulated connection drops.\n    *   Testing with different browser settings (e.g., disabled JavaScript).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input sanitization checks to prevent XSS attacks in the country field.\n    *   SQL injection prevention (if the application interacts with a database).\n*   **Specific Test Cases based on User Goal (\"Type in country, select valid option, and alert handle\"):**\n    1.  Type a valid country name (e.g., \"United States\") and select the correct option from the dropdown. Verify no errors occur.\n    2.  Type a valid country name, select the correct option, and trigger an alert (if applicable on the page). Verify the alert is displayed correctly and can be handled.\n    3.  Type a partial country name (e.g., \"United\") and select an option. Verify the selection is handled correctly.\n    4.  Type an invalid country name and verify no options are displayed in the dropdown.\n    5.  Type a valid country name, select an option, and then clear the input field. Verify the selection is cleared.\n    6.  Verify the alert message is correct and informative.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use a predefined set of valid and invalid country names.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Consider using a data provider to generate variations of input data for more comprehensive testing.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page on the website should have a corresponding Page Object class that encapsulates the elements and actions specific to that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content updates. This will prevent false failures due to timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically recover from minor changes in the UI. This can involve using relative locators or AI-powered element identification.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. This will allow tests to automatically retry a few times before failing, reducing the impact of transient issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify basic elements and navigation.\n2.  **Practice Page:** Focus on the input field for country, dropdown list, and alert handling.\n3.  **All other interactive elements:** Radio buttons, checkboxes, tables, iframes, and window handling.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected text and elements are visible on the page.\n    *   Form submissions are successful and redirect to the expected page.\n    *   Alerts are displayed correctly with the expected messages.\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).\n    *   Unexpected exceptions or errors.\n    *   Incorrect data displayed on the page.\n    *   Broken links or images.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities detected.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the Rahul Shetty Academy Automation Practice website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the delivery of a high-quality, reliable, and user-friendly application.\n"
