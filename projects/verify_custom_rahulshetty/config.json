  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Rahul Shetty Academy - Automation Practice\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Rahul Shetty Academy Automation Practice website (https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/). It provides a comprehensive plan for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application, focusing on regression testing and the specific user goal of country selection and alert handling. This strategy will guide the entire engineering team, including Senior QAs, Test Architects, and SDETs, in their testing efforts.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The application appears to be a general web application for practicing automation testing. While not directly tied to revenue generation, failures can lead to inaccurate learning and a negative user experience for aspiring automation engineers.\n\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **Medium:** System failures could lead to a poor user experience, incorrect learning, and potentially impact the reputation of the Rahul Shetty Academy. Data breaches are unlikely given the nature of the application.\n    *   **Impact Areas:** User Experience, Learning Outcomes, Brand Reputation.\n\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All functionalities of the website, including form submissions, UI elements, and interactive components.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n        *   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n        *   Specific focus on the country selection functionality and alert handling.\n        *   Negative testing of input fields and form submissions.\n        *   Accessibility testing (basic checks).\n        *   Performance testing (page load times).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   In-depth security penetration testing (beyond basic OWASP Top 10 checks).\n        *   Load testing (beyond basic performance checks).\n        *   Integration with external systems (if any).\n        *   Detailed accessibility compliance (WCAG).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Verify the basic functionality of the website is operational after deployment.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        *   Verify the website homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        *   Verify key elements on the homepage are visible (e.g., header, footer, main content).\n        *   Verify basic form submission functionality (e.g., entering a name and clicking \"Submit\").\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After each build/deployment.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions and that existing functionality remains intact.\n    *   **Test Areas:**\n        *   **Country Selection and Alert Handling (Primary Focus):**\n            *   Verify the country selection dropdown is populated correctly.\n            *   Verify the user can select a valid country.\n            *   Verify the alert message is displayed correctly after selecting a country.\n            *   Verify the alert message contains the correct country name.\n            *   Test with different browsers and screen sizes.\n        *   **Negative Testing:**\n            *   Invalid inputs in form fields (e.g., special characters, exceeding maximum length).\n            *   Submitting forms with missing required fields.\n            *   Attempting to select an invalid country (if possible).\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Handling of long country names.\n            *   Network failures during form submission.\n            *   Concurrency (multiple users accessing the website simultaneously).\n            *   Empty states (e.g., no countries available in the dropdown).\n        *   **Security:**\n            *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on input fields to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n            *   Verify that sensitive data (if any) is not exposed in the URL or cookies.\n        *   **Performance:**\n            *   Measure page load times for key pages.\n            *   Identify and address any performance bottlenecks.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:** A predefined list of valid and invalid country names.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Generate random strings for input fields to cover a wider range of scenarios.\n    *   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a separate file (e.g., CSV, JSON) and accessed by the test scripts.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to improve code maintainability and reusability. Each page of the website should be represented as a separate Page Object, encapsulating the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n    *   **Language:** Java or Python are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n    *   **Testing Framework:** JUnit or TestNG (Java), pytest (Python).\n    *   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ (Java), Pytest Assertions (Python).\n    *   **Reporting:** Extent Reports (Java), Allure Report (Python).\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous operations and potential delays.\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n        *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry mechanisms for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network failures).\n    *   **Self-Healing:**\n        *   Implement mechanisms to automatically locate elements based on multiple locators (e.g., ID, CSS selector, XPath) in case one locator fails.\n        *   Use relative locators to find elements based on their proximity to other elements.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n\n    *   **Prioritize Exploration:**\n        *   The country selection dropdown and related alert functionality.\n        *   All form submission pages.\n        *   Pages with interactive elements (e.g., buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons).\n    *   **Specific Pages:**\n        *   The main practice page (https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/).\n        *   Any pages linked from the main practice page that contain forms or interactive elements.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    *   **Success Criteria:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n        *   Expected elements are visible on the page.\n        *   Form submissions are successful (no error messages).\n        *   Alert messages are displayed correctly with the expected content.\n        *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n        *   Page load times are within acceptable limits (e.g., < 3 seconds).\n    *   **Failure Criteria:**\n        *   HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500).\n        *   Unexpected error messages.\n        *   JavaScript errors.\n        *   Incorrect data displayed on the page.\n        *   Page load times exceeding acceptable limits.\n        *   Security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for ensuring the quality and reliability of the Rahul Shetty Academy Automation Practice website. By following this plan, the engineering team can effectively identify and address potential issues, delivering a positive user experience for aspiring automation engineers.\n"
