  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. My mandate is to create a comprehensive Master Test Strategy for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing and the specific user goal of logging in with the \"standard_user\" and \"secret_sauce\" credentials. Here's the breakdown:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://www.saucedemo.com/\n**Business Domain:** General E-commerce (Simulated)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo.com is a simulated e-commerce application. While not a real business, it mimics common e-commerce functionalities like login, product browsing, adding to cart, and checkout.  The most critical functions are:\n\n*   **Login:** Authentication is the gateway to the application.\n*   **Product Browsing:** Displaying products and their details.\n*   **Add to Cart:** Allowing users to select products for purchase.\n*   **Checkout:** Processing the order and payment (simulated).\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nEven though it's a demo application, failures can represent real-world risks:\n\n*   **Authentication Failure:** Prevents users from accessing the application.\n*   **Product Display Issues:** Incorrect prices, descriptions, or missing images can lead to user frustration.\n*   **Cart Errors:** Inability to add or remove items from the cart results in lost sales (simulated).\n*   **Checkout Process Breakdown:** Failure to complete the checkout process is a critical failure.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** While not handling real data, vulnerabilities like XSS or SQL injection could be present in the code.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to login, product browsing, adding to cart, and checkout.\n*   Positive and negative test scenarios for all input fields.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).\n*   Basic security testing (OWASP Top 10 basics).\n*   Performance testing (page load times for key pages).\n*   Accessibility testing (basic WCAG compliance).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Extensive performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Detailed security penetration testing.\n*   Integration with external systems (as it's a demo).\n*   Advanced accessibility testing beyond basic WCAG.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is working.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify the application home page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    *   Verify successful login with valid credentials (\"standard_user\" / \"secret_sauce\").\n    *   Verify that products are displayed on the inventory page after login.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will cover a wider range of scenarios to ensure existing functionality is not broken.\n\n*   **Login:**\n    *   **Positive:** Login with valid credentials (standard_user, locked_out_user, problem_user, performance_glitch_user).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Invalid username.\n        *   Invalid password.\n        *   Locked out user.\n        *   SQL Injection attempts in username/password fields.\n*   **Product Browsing:**\n    *   Verify product details page loads correctly.\n    *   Verify product images are displayed.\n    *   Verify product prices are displayed correctly.\n*   **Add to Cart:**\n    *   Add a single item to the cart.\n    *   Add multiple items to the cart.\n    *   Remove an item from the cart.\n    *   Verify the cart count is updated correctly.\n*   **Checkout:**\n    *   Complete the checkout process with valid shipping information.\n    *   Complete the checkout process with invalid shipping information (e.g., missing fields, invalid zip code).\n    *   Verify order confirmation page is displayed.\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Attempt to add more items to the cart than available in stock (if applicable).\n    *   Submit forms with missing required fields.\n    *   Input invalid data types into form fields (e.g., text in a numeric field).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Test with different screen resolutions and browsers.\n    *   Simulate network latency and failures.\n    *   Test with a large number of items in the cart.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic XSS vulnerability checks on all input fields.\n    *   SQL Injection attempts on login and search fields.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use predefined usernames and passwords for login tests.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Generate random data for shipping information (names, addresses, etc.) to avoid data duplication and ensure uniqueness.  Consider using libraries like Faker.js for dynamic data generation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM)\n    *   Create separate page objects for each page (e.g., LoginPage, InventoryPage, CartPage, CheckoutPage).\n    *   Each page object should contain the locators for the elements on that page and the methods to interact with those elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to appear or disappear, especially after asynchronous operations.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to handle dynamic content loading.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement a mechanism to automatically retry failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).  Consider using a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.\n    *   **Locator Strategy:** Prioritize robust locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `data-qa`) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Prioritized Exploration):**\n    1.  **Login Page:**  Focus on all possible login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials, locked accounts).\n    2.  **Inventory Page:**  Explore product display, sorting, and filtering.\n    3.  **Cart Page:**  Test adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.\n    4.  **Checkout Pages (Information, Overview, Completion):**  Thoroughly test the entire checkout flow with various data inputs.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return a 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that key elements are visible on each page (e.g., product names, prices, cart total).\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text is displayed on each page (e.g., \"Welcome, [username]\", \"Thank you for your order!\").\n    *   **Functional Verification:** Verify that actions perform as expected (e.g., adding an item to the cart increases the cart count).\n    *   **Error Message Verification:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.\n```\n"
