  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for Saucedemo.com, focusing specifically on the requested smoke test scenario. This document provides a comprehensive blueprint to guide the engineering team through the testing process.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com (E-commerce)\n**Test Type:** Smoke Test\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The application is an e-commerce platform, implying core functionalities include product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout. Login is a critical entry point.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of login and adding to cart directly impacts the user's ability to purchase, leading to revenue loss and potentially damaging user trust. This is a high-risk area.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials (\"standard\\_user\", \"secret\\_sauce\").\n        *   Adding the \"Sauce Labs Backpack\" to the shopping cart.\n        *   Verification of the cart badge displaying \"1\".\n        *   Navigation to the cart page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Invalid login attempts.\n        *   Product catalog browsing.\n        *   Checkout process.\n        *   Payment processing.\n        *   Other products besides \"Sauce Labs Backpack\".\n        *   Negative testing.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):** This smoke test will be a single, critical path test to validate core functionality.\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.saucedemo.com/`.\n    2.  Enter username \"standard\\_user\".\n    3.  Enter password \"secret\\_sauce\".\n    4.  Click the \"Login\" button.\n    5.  Verify successful login (page title or welcome element present).\n    6.  Locate the \"Sauce Labs Backpack\" product.\n    7.  Click the \"Add to Cart\" button for the \"Sauce Labs Backpack\".\n    8.  Verify the cart badge displays \"1\".\n    9.  Click the cart icon.\n    10. Verify navigation to the cart page.\n\n*   **Regression Suite:**  **Not Applicable** (This is a smoke test only. Regression testing would involve more comprehensive coverage, as defined in the Strategic Knowledge Bank above).\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:**  The username (\"standard\\_user\") and password (\"secret\\_sauce\") will be hardcoded as known valid credentials for this test. This ensures consistency and reliability.\n    *   The product name \"Sauce Labs Backpack\" is considered static for this specific smoke test.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM).  This will improve maintainability.  Each page (Login, Inventory, Cart) should have its own Page Object.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use short polling assertions when waiting for elements to appear or for text to change (e.g., after adding an item to the cart, poll for the cart badge to update to \"1\").  A reasonable poll interval would be 200ms with a timeout of 2 seconds.  This helps mitigate timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:**  Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts (e.g., 5 seconds) for elements to become interactable before attempting to click or send keys.\n\n**Example POM Structure (Illustrative):**\n\n```\n# login_page.py\nclass LoginPage:\n    def __init__(self, driver):\n        self.driver = driver\n        self.username_field = (By.ID, \"user-name\")\n        self.password_field = (By.ID, \"password\")\n        self.login_button = (By.ID, \"login-button\")\n\n    def enter_username(self, username):\n        self.driver.find_element(*self.username_field).send_keys(username)\n\n    def enter_password(self, password):\n        self.driver.find_element(*self.password_field).send_keys(password)\n\n    def click_login(self):\n        self.driver.find_element(*self.login_button).click()\n\n# inventory_page.py\nclass InventoryPage:\n    def __init__(self, driver):\n        self.driver = driver\n    def add_backpack_to_cart(self):\n        # Logic to find and click \"Add to Cart\" for backpack\n        pass\n\n# cart_page.py\nclass CartPage:\n    # Define elements and actions for the cart page\n    pass\n```\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/` (Login Page)\n    2.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html` (Inventory Page - after successful login)\n    3.  `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html` (Cart Page - After adding item and clicking cart).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Login Success:** After clicking \"Login\", the page URL should change to `https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html` AND a welcome element (e.g., page title containing \"Products\") should be visible.\n    *   **Add to Cart Success:** After clicking \"Add to Cart\" for the \"Sauce Labs Backpack\", the cart badge element should display \"1\".\n    *   **Cart Navigation Success:** After clicking the cart icon, the page URL should change to `https://www.saucedemo.com/cart.html` AND an element confirming the presence of the item (e.g., the name \"Sauce Labs Backpack\") should be visible in the cart.  Also, it should display the correct quantity (i.e., 1).\n*   **Reporting:** Clear and concise failure messages should be generated, including screenshots and console logs. Failures should be immediately investigated and addressed.  The test should either Pass or Fail.  There is no concept of \"partial success\" in a smoke test.\n\nThis document provides a solid foundation for executing the Saucedemo.com smoke test. Remember that this is a living document and should be updated as needed. Good luck!"
