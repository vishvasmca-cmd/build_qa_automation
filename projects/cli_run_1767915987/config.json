While it's not a real bank, the functionalities represent core banking operations. Therefore, failures can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Misrepresentation:** Incorrect balances or failed transactions can mislead users.\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Security vulnerabilities could expose sensitive account information.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Even as a demo, bugs can erode trust in the software's capabilities.\n\n**Business Criticality (P0):** Account opening, login, balance inquiries, fund transfers, and loan requests are P0.\n\n### Risk Profile\n\n*   **High Risk:** Fund transfers, account access, and data modification. Errors in these areas directly impact the simulated finances and user information. Data breaches related to account information constitute high risk.\n*   **Medium Risk:** Account creation, bill payment, and finding transactions. These affect user experience and data accuracy.\n*   **Low Risk:** Navigation, static content display, and help pages.\n\n### Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user registration, login, account management, fund transfers, bill payments, loan requests, transaction history, and customer service features (contact form).\n*   Security aspects including authentication, authorization, and data protection (basic OWASP Top 10).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge).\n*   Performance under moderate load (basic response time checks).\n*   Accessibility (basic WCAG compliance).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Comprehensive performance testing (load, stress, endurance) beyond basic checks.\n*   Detailed accessibility testing to full WCAG standards.\n*   Mobile application testing (unless specifically required).\n*   Integration with external systems (since it's a demo).\n*   Detailed penetration testing.\n*   Support for older browser versions.\n*   Multi-language support (if not explicitly present).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (\"The How\")\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Purpose:** Verify core system health after each build.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to the homepage and verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 and specific elements visible).\n    2.  Attempt to log in with valid credentials (existing user). Verify successful login and redirection to account summary page.\n    3.  Verify that the \"Open New Account\" functionality is accessible from the logged-in state.\n    4.  Attempt a small fund transfer between two existing accounts. Verify balance changes are reflected in both accounts.\n*   **Data:** Use a static set of known valid user credentials and account numbers.\n*   **Environment:** Execute against the target environment (e.g., QA).\n\n### Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Categories:**\n\n    *   **Account Management:**\n        *   Account Creation:  Valid/Invalid data, existing username, password complexity.\n        *   Account Summary: Display of correct information, balance calculations.\n        *   Account Updates: Address changes, profile updates.\n    *   **Login/Authentication:**\n        *   Valid/Invalid Credentials: Verify error messages, lockout mechanisms.\n        *   Session Management: Timeout, concurrency.\n        *   Password Recovery: Functionality, security questions.\n    *   **Fund Transfers:**\n        *   Sufficient/Insufficient Funds: Verify error handling.\n        *   Valid/Invalid Account Numbers: Verify validation.\n        *   Transfer Limits: Check maximum amounts.\n    *   **Bill Payment:**\n        *   Valid/Invalid Payee Information: Verify validation.\n        *   Payment Scheduling: Future-dated payments.\n        *   Recurring Payments: Setup and cancellation.\n    *   **Loan Requests:**\n        *   Valid/Invalid Loan Amounts/Down Payments: Verify acceptance criteria.\n        *   Loan Approval Logic: (Simulate different scenarios).\n        *   Loan History: Display and accuracy.\n    *   **Transaction History:**\n        *   Filtering and Sorting: By date, amount, type.\n        *   Accuracy and Completeness: Ensure all transactions are recorded.\n    *   **Security (OWASP Top 10 Basics):**\n        *   SQL Injection: Attempt to inject SQL code into input fields.\n        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Attempt to inject JavaScript code.\n        *   Broken Authentication: Test for weak password policies and session management flaws.\n        *   Sensitive Data Exposure: Verify sensitive data (passwords, account numbers) is not exposed in logs or responses.\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid inputs for all fields (e.g., special characters, excessively long strings).\n    *   Boundary value testing (min/max values for amounts, lengths).\n    *   Simulating timeouts and network errors during transactions.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users accessing the same account simultaneously.\n    *   Empty states: Handling empty transaction histories, empty account lists.\n    *   Large datasets: Testing with a large number of accounts/transactions.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Test Data Generation:**  Use a combination of:\n        *   **Static Data:**  Pre-defined user accounts with specific roles and permissions.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:**  Generate data programmatically (e.g., using Faker libraries) for new accounts, transactions, etc.\n    *   **Data Storage:**  Store test data in configuration files or a small database.  Avoid hardcoding data within test scripts.\n    *   **Data Cleanup:**  Implement mechanisms to reset the database to a known state before and after test execution to ensure test independence.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement POM to represent each page of the application as a class. This promotes code reusability and maintainability. Each page object encapsulates the elements and methods for interacting with that page.\n*   **Languages/Libraries**\n    *   Java/Selenium or Javascript/Playwright will both work well for this project.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling mechanisms (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met, rather than relying on fixed timeouts. This helps to handle asynchronous operations and reduce flakiness.\n    *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry logic for flaky tests. If a test fails due to a transient error (e.g., network glitch), retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically locate elements even if their locators change.  This can involve using multiple locators (e.g., ID, XPath, CSS) and fallback mechanisms.\n    *   **Test Data Management:** Ensure that test data is properly isolated and managed to prevent test interference. Use unique identifiers for test accounts and transactions to avoid conflicts.\n    *   **Environment Management:** Isolate test environments to prevent interference from other activities. Use dedicated test databases and application instances.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Account Summary Page:**  Explore all links and elements on the account summary page after login. This is a critical entry point for most functionalities.\n    2.  **Transfer Funds Page:**  Focus on exploring different combinations of source and destination accounts, amounts, and transfer options.\n    3.  **Bill Payment Page:**  Explore different payee types, payment schedules, and payment amounts.\n    4.  **Request Loan Page:**  Explore different loan amounts, down payments, and loan purposes.\n    5.  **Transaction History Page:** Explore different filter options (date ranges, transaction types) and verify that the displayed transactions are accurate.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:**  Verify that all page requests return HTTP 200 (OK) unless an error is expected.\n    *   **Element Visibility:**  Verify that key elements are visible on each page (e.g., account balances, transaction details, error messages).\n    *   **Data Accuracy:** Verify that data displayed on the page is accurate and consistent with the underlying data sources.\n    *   **Error Messages:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or failed operations.  Error messages should be clear and informative.\n    *   **Functionality:**  Verify that all functional elements (buttons, links, forms) work as expected.\n    *   **Security:**  Check for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection) by attempting to inject malicious code into input fields.\n    *   **Accessibility:**  Perform basic accessibility checks to ensure that the application is usable by people with disabilities.  This can involve using screen readers and keyboard navigation."
