  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: aliyuncs.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the aliyuncs.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** aliyuncs.com is a cloud computing platform. Website availability and core navigation are critical for user acquisition and service accessibility.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core website functionality can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Potential Customers:** Inability to access information or sign up.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the platform's reliability.\n    *   **Reduced Service Adoption:** Hinders users from exploring and adopting cloud services.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic attributes (e.g., text).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Detailed functionality of linked pages.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key navigation elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the aliyuncs.com website loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present on the homepage.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button is present on the homepage.\n        5.  **Button 4 Presence:** Verify a fourth button is present on the homepage.\n        6.  **Button 5 Presence:** Verify a fifth button is present on the homepage.\n        7.  **Link 1 Presence:** Verify a link is present on the homepage.\n        8.  **Link 2 Presence:** Verify a second link is present on the homepage.\n        9.  **Menu Bar 1 Presence:** Verify a menu bar is present on the homepage.\n        10. **Menu Bar 2 Presence:** Verify a second menu bar is present on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for initial smoke testing. Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document after initial functionality is implemented.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the aliyuncs.com homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class with methods to identify and verify the presence of the target elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Example:** Instead of `assert element.isDisplayed()`, use:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\n\n# Example using Selenium with Python\ntry:\n    element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(\n        EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, \"login-button\")) # Replace with actual locator\n    )\n    assert element.is_displayed()\nexcept:\n    print(\"Login button not found or not displayed within 10 seconds\")\n    raise # Re-raise the exception to fail the test\n```\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://aliyuncs.com):** This is the primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and page title contains \"Alibaba Cloud\" or similar branding.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page and visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS).  Verify the element's `is_displayed()` property is true.\n    *   **No Errors:** No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console during page load.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the aliyuncs.com website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the core functionality is verified effectively and efficiently."
