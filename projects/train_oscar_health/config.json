  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan designed for autonomous agents to perform smoke testing on the HiOscar website. This plan emphasizes clear instructions for mining, verification, and structuring the test suite.\n\n# Master Test Plan: HiOscar.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the test plan for performing smoke tests on the HiOscar website (https://www.hioscar.com). The primary goal is to ensure the site is up, core navigation is functional, and a key user flow is operational.  This plan is designed to be executed by autonomous testing agents.\n\n## 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.hioscar.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Healthcare (Health Insurance)\n*   **Purpose:** Oscar Health is a health insurance company focused on providing easy-to-understand and technology-driven healthcare plans.\n*   **Target Audience:** Individuals and families seeking health insurance, employers looking for group health plans.\n*   **Key Areas of Interest (for testing):**\n    *   Homepage: Main entry point, marketing information, navigation.\n    *   Quote Flow:  Critical conversion path for potential customers.\n    *   Plans & Benefits: Information about available insurance plans.\n    *   Member Resources: (If applicable) Portal for existing members.\n\n## 3. Test Scope\n\nThis test plan focuses on smoke testing, which covers the essential functionality and stability of the HiOscar website.\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Website availability and basic loading.\n    *   Core navigation (main menu links).\n    *   Homepage headline verification.\n    *   \"Get a Quote\" button functionality.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Detailed testing of all insurance plans and benefits.\n    *   Form validation and error handling (beyond basic existence).\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n    *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n\n## 4. Smoke Test Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke test suite will consist of three main test cases:\n\n### 4.1. Website Availability & Core Navigation\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Case Name:** Website Up and Running + Core Navigation\n*   **Description:** Verifies the website is accessible and the main menu links are functional.\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  **Navigate to:** https://www.hioscar.com\n    2.  **Verify:** HTTP Status Code is 200 (OK) - *Critical Check*.\n    3.  **Verify:** Page title contains \"Oscar\" OR \"Health Insurance\" - *Basic Sanity Check*.\n    4.  **Mine:** Identify all top-level navigation links in the main menu (e.g., \"Plans,\" \"For Employers,\" \"Find a Doctor,\" \"About Us\").  **STRATEGIC MINING INSTRUCTION:** Use CSS selector `nav[aria-label=\"Main Menu\"] a` to reliably locate the main menu links.\n    5.  **For Each** identified navigation link:\n        *   **Click** the link.\n        *   **Verify:** The page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        *   **Verify:** The page title is NOT a generic error message (e.g., \"404 Not Found\", \"Error\").\n\n### 4.2. Homepage Headline Verification\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Case Name:** Homepage Hero Headline Verification\n*   **Description:**  Verifies the main headline on the homepage contains the expected text.\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  **Navigate to:** https://www.hioscar.com\n    2.  **Mine:** Locate the main hero headline element. **STRATEGIC MINING INSTRUCTION:** Use CSS selector `h1` or `h2` within the `<header>` section of the page to identify the primary headline. Prioritize `h1` if found.\n    3.  **Verify:** The text content of the headline element *contains* the string \"Health insurance made easy\".  (Case-insensitive match).\n\n### 4.3. \"Get a Quote\" Button Flow\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Case Name:** Get a Quote Button Functionality\n*   **Description:**  Verifies the \"Get a Quote\" button is present and navigates the user to the quote flow.\n*   **Test Steps:**\n    1.  **Navigate to:** https://www.hioscar.com\n    2.  **Mine:** Locate the \"Get a Quote\" button. **STRATEGIC MINING INSTRUCTION:** Look for a button element (`<button>` or `<a>` with `role=\"button\"`) containing the text \"Get a Quote\" or a visually similar phrase (e.g., \"See Plans & Prices\").  Prioritize buttons near the hero section or in the main navigation. Use the following CSS selectors: `a[href*='quote']`, `button:contains('Quote')`.\n    3.  **Verify:** The \"Get a Quote\" button is present on the page (element exists).\n    4.  **Click:** the \"Get a Quote\" button.\n    5.  **Verify:** The URL changes to include \"/quote\" OR \"/plans\" OR contains a query parameter like \"zip=\".  This indicates navigation towards a quote or plans page.\n    6.  **Verify:**  The new page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n\n## 5. Strategic Mining Instructions (RECAP)\n\nThese instructions are critical for the autonomous agent to efficiently and accurately locate key elements:\n\n*   **Main Menu Links:** `nav[aria-label=\"Main Menu\"] a`\n*   **Homepage Headline:** `h1` or `h2` within the `<header>` section. Prioritize `h1`.\n*   **\"Get a Quote\" Button:** `a[href*='quote']`, `button:contains('Quote')`. Prioritize buttons near the hero section or in the main navigation.\n\n## 6. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version) - *Initial Focus*\n*   **Operating System:**  Platform independent (tests should run on any OS).\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection required.\n\n## 7. Test Data\n\n*   No specific test data is required for these smoke tests. The focus is on navigation and element presence.\n\n## 8. Reporting\n\n*   The autonomous agent should generate a clear report indicating the PASS/FAIL status of each test case and step.\n*   Failed tests should include:\n    *   Test Case ID and Name\n    *   Step number that failed\n    *   Error message (e.g., HTTP status code, element not found, text mismatch)\n    *   Screenshot (if possible)\n\n## 9. Success/Failure Criteria\n\n*   **Success:** All three smoke test cases (SMOKE-001, SMOKE-002, SMOKE-003) pass.\n*   **Failure:** Any of the smoke test cases fail.\n\n## 10. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to include more core flows (e.g., finding a doctor, exploring plans).\n*   Implement cross-browser compatibility testing.\n*   Add more detailed verification of page content and functionality.\n*   Integrate with a CI/CD pipeline for automated execution on every code change.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for autonomous agents to perform effective smoke testing on the HiOscar website.  By following the strategic mining instructions and verification steps, the agents can quickly identify critical issues and ensure the website's core functionality remains operational."
