  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Microsoft Edge Website (msedge.net)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Microsoft Edge website (msedge.net), focusing on smoke testing. It provides a blueprint for the engineering team, including Senior QAs, Test Architects, and SDETs, to ensure a robust and efficient testing process.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** The Microsoft Edge website serves as a primary entry point for users to download, learn about, and engage with the Edge browser. Its availability and functionality are crucial for user acquisition, brand perception, and overall Microsoft ecosystem engagement.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure of the website can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of User Acquisition:** Potential users unable to download the browser.\n    *   **Damage to Brand Reputation:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on Microsoft.\n    *   **Reduced User Engagement:** Existing users unable to access resources and updates.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key elements (buttons, links, menus) on the homepage.\n        *   Functionality of core navigation elements (without clicking).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of individual features within the browser.\n        *   Performance testing (beyond basic load time).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (beyond ensuring basic rendering in major browsers).\n        *   Accessibility testing (beyond basic checks).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid input).\n        *   Clicking on any links or buttons.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a smoke test suite designed to quickly verify the core functionality of the website.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Homepage Rendering:** Verify the homepage renders without major visual defects.\n        3.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   At least 5 buttons (e.g., \"Download Now\", \"Get Started\", \"Try for Free\", \"Sign Up\", \"Login\").\n            *   At least 2 links (e.g., \"Privacy\", \"Terms of Use\").\n            *   At least 2 menu bars (e.g., main navigation menu, footer menu).\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on verifying the presence and basic rendering of elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the homepage and its elements. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage` class: Contains locators for buttons, links, and menus.\n        *   Methods: `isDownloadButtonPresent()`, `isPrivacyLinkPresent()`, `isMainMenuPresent()`, etc.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential loading delays. This will prevent false failures due to elements not being immediately available.\n        *   Example: Instead of `Assert.assertTrue(homePage.isDownloadButtonPresent())`, use a polling assertion that retries for a specified duration.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://msedge.net):** Focus on identifying the required elements (buttons, links, menus) on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Availability:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Homepage Rendering:** No major visual defects (e.g., broken images, overlapping text).\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   Presence of at least 5 buttons with relevant text (e.g., \"Download\", \"Get Started\").\n        *   Presence of at least 2 links with relevant text (e.g., \"Privacy\", \"Terms of Use\").\n        *   Presence of at least 2 menu bars with visible menu items.\n*   **Success Definition:** All verification criteria are met. If any criterion fails, the build is considered unstable and should be rejected."
