  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Windows.net Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the initial smoke testing of the Windows.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Windows.net is a critical marketing and information portal for Microsoft's Windows operating system and related services. Its availability and functionality directly impact brand perception, customer acquisition, and revenue generation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the Windows.net website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on Microsoft's brand.\n    *   **Lost Leads:** Potential customers may be unable to access information or sign up for services.\n    *   **Reduced Sales:** Inability to access product information or purchase options can directly impact sales.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, 2 other buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking or interacting with any of the identified elements.\n        *   Detailed functional testing of any specific feature or service.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially, focus on a single primary browser - Chrome).\n        *   Mobile device testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to `https://windows.net` and verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status).\n        2.  **Element Identification:**\n            *   Locate and verify the presence of \"Login\" button.\n            *   Locate and verify the presence of \"Signup/GetStarted\" button (or equivalent).\n            *   Locate and verify the presence of \"Try for Free\" button (or equivalent).\n            *   Locate and verify the presence of 2 other buttons.\n            *   Locate and verify the presence of 2 links.\n            *   Locate and verify the presence of 2 menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for initial smoke testing.* A regression suite will be defined in a subsequent phase after the initial smoke tests are stable.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this initial smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Windows.net website. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` Page Object that encapsulates the locators and methods for interacting with the elements on the homepage (buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to handle potential delays in element loading. This will reduce flakiness caused by slow network connections or server response times.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to be present and visible before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed element location attempts.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://windows.net`):** This is the primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 (Success)\n    *   **Element Identification:**\n        *   Element Presence: The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page (verified using appropriate locators - e.g., XPath, CSS selectors).\n        *   Element Visibility: The elements are visible on the page (not hidden or obscured).\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating the success or failure of each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for any failed test cases, including screenshots and relevant logs.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for the initial smoke testing of the Windows.net website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the website is accessible and key UI elements are present, mitigating the risks associated with website failure."
