  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. Here's a Master Test Strategy document for uitestingplayground.com, focusing on regression testing and the specific user goal of verifying unique locator handling on the Dynamic ID page.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: uitestingplayground.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** uitestingplayground.com\n**Business Domain:** General Web Application (Testing Sandbox)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** uitestingplayground.com is a testing sandbox. While not a critical business application in itself, its proper functioning is crucial for testers learning and practicing automation. Failure impacts learning and demonstration capabilities.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Low financial risk. Moderate risk of reputational damage if the site is consistently broken, hindering its purpose. High risk of misleading test results if locators are unstable.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All elements and functionalities on the website.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n        *   Responsiveness across different screen sizes.\n        *   Specifically, the \"Dynamic ID\" page and its unique locator handling.\n        *   Basic security checks (input validation).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress).\n        *   Advanced security penetration testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - although basic checks are encouraged.\n        *   Database testing (as the site appears to be stateless).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   Verify the website is accessible and loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    *   Verify all main navigation links are working (click and page loads).\n    *   Verify the \"Dynamic ID\" page is accessible.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Dynamic ID Page Focus:**\n        *   Verify that the button on the \"Dynamic ID\" page *always* has a unique ID.\n        *   Verify that clicking the button does not cause any errors.\n        *   Verify that the button is visible and clickable across different browsers and screen sizes.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Attempt to access non-existent pages (e.g., `http://uitestingplayground.com/nonexistent`). Verify a proper 404 error is displayed.\n        *   Input validation on any forms present (e.g., special characters, excessively long strings).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Simulate network latency/failures while interacting with the \"Dynamic ID\" page.\n        *   Test with different browser versions.\n        *   Test with JavaScript disabled (if applicable).\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic XSS prevention check: Attempt to inject JavaScript into any input fields.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Static Data:** For basic navigation and page load tests, no specific data is needed.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** For the \"Dynamic ID\" page, the test must dynamically identify the button's ID each time the page loads.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Essential for maintainability. Create a `HomePage` object, a `DynamicIdPage` object, and potentially other page objects as needed.\n    *   **Language:**  [Choose a language like Java, Python, or C# based on team expertise]\n    *   **Testing Framework:** [Choose a framework like JUnit, pytest, or NUnit based on the language]\n    *   **Assertion Library:** [Choose an assertion library like AssertJ, Hamcrest, or FluentAssertions based on the language]\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:**  When verifying the presence of the button with the dynamic ID, use polling assertions (e.g., with `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to allow time for the element to load and the ID to be generated.\n    *   **Locator Strategy:**  Prioritize robust locator strategies that are *less* dependent on the dynamic ID itself.  For example, use relative locators (e.g., \"button near text 'Button with Dynamic ID'\") or CSS selectors based on the button's other attributes.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Consider):**  If locator flakiness is a major issue, explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI-powered locator finders) as a secondary strategy.  However, focus on robust locator strategies first.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Verify all links are functional.\n    2.  **Dynamic ID Page:**  This is the primary focus.  The autonomous agent should repeatedly visit this page and attempt to click the button, verifying that a unique ID is always present and that the click is successful.\n    3.  **Other Pages:**  Explore other pages on the site to identify potential regression issues.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:**  Verify that all pages return a 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Element Presence:**  Verify that key elements (e.g., the button on the \"Dynamic ID\" page) are present and visible.\n    *   **Clickability:** Verify that interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links) are clickable and lead to the expected result.\n    *   **Unique ID Verification:**  On the \"Dynamic ID\" page, the test *must* verify that the button's ID changes on each page load.  This is the core requirement.\n    *   **Error Handling:**  Verify that the application handles errors gracefully (e.g., displaying appropriate error messages).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing uitestingplayground.com, with a specific focus on the \"Dynamic ID\" page. It emphasizes robust locator strategies, resilience, and clear verification criteria to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.\n"
