  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: A2Z.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the A2Z.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the core functionality of the application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nA2Z.com is a general web application. The specific business domain is not explicitly defined, but we can assume it encompasses common web functionalities such as user authentication, navigation, and content display.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the A2Z.com website to load or provide basic functionality can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of User Trust:** Users may abandon the site if they encounter immediate issues.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** A non-functional website can negatively impact the company's image.\n*   **Potential Revenue Loss:** If the website supports transactions, downtime directly translates to lost revenue.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   Website launch and accessibility.\n*   Existence and visibility of key UI elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, and 5 other buttons.\n*   Existence and visibility of 2 links.\n*   Existence and visibility of 2 menu bars.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Functionality of buttons, links, and menu items (no clicking or interaction).\n*   Specific content verification beyond presence.\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n*   Mobile responsiveness.\n*   Error handling.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will consist of the following tests:\n\n1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the A2Z.com website loads successfully in a browser.\n2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the page.\n3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"GetStarted\" button (or similar) is present and visible on the page.\n4.  **Five Additional Buttons Presence:** Verify the presence and visibility of five other distinct buttons on the page.\n5.  **Two Links Presence:** Verify the presence and visibility of two distinct links on the page.\n6.  **Two Menu Bars Presence:** Verify the presence and visibility of two distinct menu bars on the page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Not Applicable for Smoke Testing)\n\nA Regression Suite will be defined in a separate document after the Smoke Testing strategy is implemented.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for the Smoke Tests, as we are only verifying the presence of UI elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** While the Smoke Tests are simple, adopting a POM structure from the beginning will provide a solid foundation for future Regression Testing. Create Page Objects for the main page and any relevant sections (e.g., header, footer).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** If elements are slow to load, use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible before asserting their presence.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test execution in case of temporary network issues or server instability.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should focus on the following areas:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** The primary target for all Smoke Tests.\n2.  **Header:** Examine the header section for Login, Signup/GetStarted, and menu bars.\n3.  **Body:** Scan the main body of the page for the remaining buttons and links.\n4.  **Footer:** Check the footer for additional links and buttons.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the page title contains \"A2Z\" (or a similar identifier).\n*   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present in the DOM and are visible on the page (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()` in Selenium).\n*   **No Exceptions:** The test execution should not result in any unhandled exceptions or errors.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for Smoke Testing the A2Z.com website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the core functionality of the application is verified effectively and efficiently."
