While not a real-world financial institution, failures can simulate real-world banking errors, leading to incorrect balances, failed transactions, and security vulnerabilities.\n*   **Risk Profile:** The primary risks associated with ParaBank failures are data integrity (incorrect account balances), functional errors (failed transactions), and potential security vulnerabilities (unauthorized access). The impact is moderate, primarily affecting user confidence and data accuracy within the demo environment.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Login functionality\n        *   Navigation to \"Find Transactions\" page\n        *   Navigation to \"About Us\" page\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   All other functionalities beyond the specified user goal (e.g., account creation, fund transfers, bill payments).\n        *   Detailed transaction searching and filtering.\n        *   API testing.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic login).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially focus on a single, primary browser).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core functionality of the application is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Verify Login:**\n            *   Navigate to the login page.\n            *   Enter valid username and password.\n            *   Verify successful login and redirection to the account overview page.\n        2.  **Verify \"Find Transactions\" Link:**\n            *   Navigate to the account overview page (after successful login).\n            *   Click the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n            *   Verify that the \"Find Transactions\" page loads successfully.\n        3.  **Verify \"About Us\" Navigation:**\n            *   Navigate to the home page (or any page with the \"About Us\" link).\n            *   Click the \"About Us\" link.\n            *   Verify that the \"About Us\" page loads successfully.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Not applicable for this \"smoke\" focused strategy.** A regression suite would be defined later, expanding on the smoke tests with more detailed scenarios and edge cases.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Test Data:** For the smoke tests, use a small set of pre-defined, valid usernames and passwords. These credentials should be stored securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secure configuration file).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a separate class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `LoginPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the login page.\n        *   `AccountOverviewPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the account overview page.\n        *   `FindTransactionsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the \"Find Transactions\" page.\n        *   `AboutUsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the \"About Us\" page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to be present and interactable before attempting to interact with them. This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for critical actions (e.g., clicking a button) that may occasionally fail due to transient issues.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and log informative error messages.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page (`/parabank/index.htm`):** Focus on the login form, username and password fields, and the login button.\n    2.  **Account Overview Page (`/parabank/overview.htm` - after login):** Focus on the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n    3.  **Home Page (`/parabank/index.htm`):** Focus on the \"About Us\" link in the footer.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Login Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for the account overview page.\n        *   Presence of a welcome message or account information on the account overview page.\n    2.  **\"Find Transactions\" Link Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for the \"Find Transactions\" page (`/parabank/findtrans.htm`).\n        *   Presence of the \"Find Transactions\" heading or relevant form elements on the page.\n    3.  **\"About Us\" Navigation Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for the \"About Us\" page (`/parabank/about.htm`).\n        *   Presence of the \"ParaSoft\" heading or relevant content on the page."
