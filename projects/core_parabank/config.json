While not a real financial institution, failures can simulate real-world banking errors, leading to incorrect balances, failed transactions, or inability to access accounts.\n*   **Risk Profile:** The primary risks associated with ParaBank failures are:\n    *   **Financial Risk:** Incorrect account balances or failed transactions could lead to perceived financial loss for users.\n    *   **Reputational Risk:** In a real-world scenario, such failures would severely damage the bank's reputation and erode customer trust.\n    *   **Data Integrity Risk:** Potential for data corruption or inconsistencies in account information.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Login functionality\n        *   Navigation to \"Find Transactions\" page\n        *   Navigation to \"About Us\" page\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   All other functionalities beyond the explicitly stated user goal (e.g., account creation, fund transfers, bill payments).\n        *   Detailed transaction searching or statement downloading.\n        *   API testing.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic login).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core functionality of the application is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Successful Login:**\n            *   Navigate to the login page.\n            *   Enter valid username and password.\n            *   Verify successful login and redirection to the account overview page.\n        2.  **Find Transactions Navigation:**\n            *   Navigate to the login page.\n            *   Enter valid username and password.\n            *   Click on the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n            *   Verify that the \"Find Transactions\" page loads successfully.\n        3.  **About Us Navigation:**\n            *   Navigate to the home page.\n            *   Click on the \"About Us\" link.\n            *   Verify that the \"About Us\" page loads successfully.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy only.  Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Test Data:** For the smoke tests, use a predefined set of valid credentials stored securely (e.g., in environment variables or a configuration file).  This ensures consistency and repeatability.  Example: `username = \"john\"; password = \"demo\"`.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page (Login, Account Overview, Find Transactions, About Us) as a separate class. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `LoginPage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the login page (username field, password field, login button, etc.).\n        *   `AccountOverviewPage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the account overview page (account list, balance information, etc.).\n        *   `FindTransactionsPage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the find transactions page.\n        *   `AboutUsPage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the about us page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with a retry mechanism) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for elements to load or pages to redirect. This reduces flakiness caused by slow network connections or server response times.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.  Avoid relying solely on implicit waits.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Login Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm` (Focus on the username and password fields, and the login button).\n    2.  **Account Overview Page:** (This page is reached after successful login.  Focus on verifying the presence of account information).\n    3.  **Find Transactions Page:** (Focus on verifying the page loads after clicking the \"Find Transactions\" link).\n    4.  **About Us Page:** (Focus on verifying the page loads after clicking the \"About Us\" link).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Successful Login:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK\n        *   Presence of account information on the Account Overview page (e.g., account list, balance information).\n    *   **Find Transactions Navigation:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK\n        *   Presence of the \"Find Transactions\" heading or other unique elements on the page.\n    *   **About Us Navigation:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK\n        *   Presence of the \"ParaSoft\" company name or other unique elements on the page."
