This domain is inherently critical due to the sensitivity of financial data and the potential for financial loss or reputational damage in case of system failures.\n\n### Risk Profile\nFailure of ParaBank can lead to:\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect transaction processing could lead to incorrect balances or unauthorized transfers.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised security could expose sensitive customer data.\n*   **Loss of Trust:** System instability or errors can erode customer confidence.\n\n### Testing Scope\n**In Scope:**\n*   Account Access (Login, Logout)\n*   Navigation to key pages (Find Transactions, About Us)\n*   Basic page load and element visibility on key pages.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n*   Detailed transaction processing (transfers, bill payments, etc.)\n*   Database integrity testing\n*   Performance testing\n*   Security testing (beyond basic login)\n*   Error handling and edge cases\n*   API testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\nThe Smoke Suite will focus on verifying the core functionality required for basic system operation. If any of these tests fail, the build should be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Login Success**\n    *   Navigate to the login page.\n    *   Enter valid username and password.\n    *   Verify successful login and redirection to the account overview page.\n*   **Test Case 2: Find Transactions Link**\n    *   Navigate to the account overview page (requires successful login from Test Case 1).\n    *   Click the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n    *   Verify that the \"Find Transactions\" page loads successfully.\n*   **Test Case 3: About Us Navigation**\n    *   Navigate to the main page.\n    *   Click the \"About Us\" link.\n    *   Verify that the \"About Us\" page loads successfully.\n\n### Regression Suite\n*This section is intentionally left blank as the user specified \"smoke\" testing only. A full regression suite would be defined in a separate strategy document.*\n\n### Data Strategy\nFor the Smoke Suite, static test data will be used. This data will consist of a known valid username and password. This data should be stored securely and be easily accessible to the test automation framework.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### Framework Recommendation\nA Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended for test automation. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n\n*   **Page Objects:** Create separate page objects for the Login Page, Account Overview Page, Find Transactions Page, and About Us Page. Each page object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n*   **Test Cases:** Test cases should interact with the page objects to perform actions and verify results.\n\n### Resilience Strategy\nFlakiness can be minimized by implementing the following strategies:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to become visible or enabled before interacting with them. This will help to avoid timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests. This will allow tests to be retried a certain number of times before being marked as failed.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### Mining Targets\nThe autonomous agent should focus on exploring the following pages and flows first:\n\n*   **Login Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm` (specifically the login form)\n*   **Account Overview Page:** (reached after successful login)\n*   **Find Transactions Page:** (reached via link on Account Overview Page)\n*   **About Us Page:** (reached via link on main page)\n\n### Verification Criteria\nSuccess is defined as:\n\n*   **HTTP 200 OK:** The page loads successfully and returns an HTTP 200 OK status code.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Key elements on the page are visible (e.g., login form, account overview table, \"About Us\" text).\n*   **Successful Login:** After submitting valid credentials, the user is redirected to the Account Overview page."
