  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nParaBank is a demonstration banking application. Within the banking domain, core functionalities like login and transaction history are critical. Failure in these areas directly impacts user access and trust.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nGiven that ParaBank is a demo application, the risk profile is relatively low compared to a real-world banking system. However, failures can still lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of User Trust:** If the application is consistently broken, users will lose confidence in its reliability.\n*   **Misleading Demonstrations:** Errors can misrepresent the capabilities of the underlying technology or the bank's services.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Login functionality.\n    *   Navigation to \"Find Transactions\" page.\n    *   Navigation to \"About Us\" page.\n    *   Basic page load and element rendering for the above.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   All other banking functionalities (account creation, transfers, bill payments, etc.).\n    *   Detailed transaction searching and filtering.\n    *   Form validation and error handling.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n    *   API testing.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a single, modern browser).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will consist of the following tests:\n\n1.  **Verify Login Page Loads:** Ensure the login page is accessible and renders correctly.\n2.  **Successful Login:** Verify a user can successfully log in with valid credentials.\n3.  **Find Transactions Link Navigation:** Verify the \"Find Transactions\" link is present and navigates to the correct page.\n4.  **About Us Navigation:** Verify the \"About Us\" link is present and navigates to the correct page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*Not applicable for the initial \"smoke\" testing focus.* A regression suite would be defined later, encompassing more detailed scenarios and edge cases.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nFor the smoke tests, static test data will be sufficient. This includes:\n\n*   **Valid Username:** A known valid username for login.\n*   **Valid Password:** The corresponding password for the valid username.\n\n*Note: For future regression testing, a more robust data strategy involving dynamic data generation and data cleanup would be required.*\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nA Page Object Model (POM) structure is highly recommended for maintainability and scalability.\n\n*   **Page Objects:** Create separate classes for each page (e.g., LoginPage, FindTransactionsPage, AboutUsPage). These classes encapsulate the page's elements and actions.\n*   **Test Cases:** Test cases should interact with the application solely through the Page Objects.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\nFlakiness can be addressed with the following strategies:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Instead of immediately failing an assertion, retry it for a short period (e.g., 5 seconds) to account for occasional delays.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n*   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors, such as re-locating elements if their locators change slightly. *Note: This is a more advanced technique and may not be necessary for the initial smoke tests.*\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages/flows FIRST:\n\n1.  **Homepage (https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm):** Focus on the login form and the \"About Us\" and \"Find Transactions\" links.\n2.  **Login Page (reached via Homepage):** Focus on successful login.\n3.  **Find Transactions Page (reached via Homepage):** Verify page load.\n4.  **About Us Page (reached via Homepage):** Verify page load.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\nSuccess is defined as:\n\n*   **HTTP 200 Status Code:** Each page load should return an HTTP 200 status code, indicating success.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Key elements on each page should be visible (e.g., login form on the homepage, specific text on the \"About Us\" page).\n*   **Successful Login:** After submitting valid credentials, the user should be redirected to the account overview page.\n*   **Correct Page Navigation:** Clicking the \"Find Transactions\" and \"About Us\" links should navigate to the correct pages without errors.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the ParaBank application. It prioritizes critical functionalities and sets the foundation for a robust and maintainable test automation framework."
