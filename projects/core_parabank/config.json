In a real-world banking context, failures can lead to financial loss, regulatory penalties, and severe reputational damage. Therefore, even in a demo context, we treat core functionalities with high criticality.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nThe primary risks associated with ParaBank are:\n\n*   **Authentication Failures:** Inability to log in prevents users from accessing their accounts.\n*   **Transaction Errors:** Incorrect or failed transactions can lead to financial discrepancies.\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Security vulnerabilities could expose sensitive user data.\n*   **Navigation Errors:** Inability to navigate to key pages.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Login functionality\n    *   Navigation to \"Find Transactions\" page\n    *   Navigation to \"About Us\" page\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Account creation\n    *   Bill payment\n    *   Fund transfers\n    *   Detailed transaction searching\n    *   All other pages and functionalities not explicitly listed in the \"User Goal.\"\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will consist of the following tests:\n\n1.  **Login Verification:**\n    *   Navigate to the login page.\n    *   Enter valid username and password.\n    *   Verify successful login and redirection to the account overview page.\n2.  **Find Transactions Navigation:**\n    *   Navigate to the login page.\n    *   Enter valid username and password.\n    *   Navigate to the \"Find Transactions\" page.\n    *   Verify that the \"Find Transactions\" page loads successfully.\n3.  **About Us Navigation:**\n    *   Navigate to the \"About Us\" page directly.\n    *   Verify that the \"About Us\" page loads successfully.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*   Not applicable for this initial smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a subsequent phase.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Test Data:** For the smoke tests, we will use a predefined set of valid credentials. These credentials will be stored securely and managed centrally.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page as a class, with elements and actions as methods. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait-until conditions) to handle potential timing issues during page loads and element rendering.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests, particularly those involving network requests or external dependencies.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n2.  **Account Overview Page:** (Post-login)\n3.  **Find Transactions Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/findtrans.htm` (reachable after login)\n4.  **About Us Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/about.htm`\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **General Success:**\n    *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK\n    *   No JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n*   **Login Page:**\n    *   Successful login redirects to the Account Overview page.\n    *   Error messages are displayed for invalid credentials.\n*   **Account Overview Page:**\n    *   \"Welcome\" text is visible, indicating successful login.\n*   **Find Transactions Page:**\n    *   The page loads without errors.\n    *   Relevant form elements (e.g., account selection, date range) are present.\n*   **About Us Page:**\n    *   The page loads without errors.\n    *   Key information about ParaBank is displayed."
