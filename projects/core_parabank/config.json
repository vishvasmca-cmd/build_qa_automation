Financial transactions, account management, and user data security are paramount. Any failures can lead to financial loss, data breaches, regulatory penalties, and significant reputational damage.\n\n### Risk Profile\nThe risk profile for ParaBank is **High**. Failures in core functionalities like login, transaction processing, or data security can have severe consequences. Specifically:\n\n*   **Financial Loss**: Incorrect transactions or unauthorized access can lead to direct financial losses for both the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach**: Compromised user data (account details, personal information) can result in identity theft and legal liabilities.\n*   **Reputational Damage**: Loss of customer trust due to system failures can have long-term negative impacts on the bank's business.\n*   **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: Failure to comply with banking regulations (e.g., data privacy, security standards) can result in fines and legal action.\n\n### Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope (Smoke)**:\n    *   Login functionality\n    *   Navigation to \"Find Transactions\" page\n    *   Navigation to \"About Us\" page\n*   **Out of Scope (For Smoke)**:\n    *   Account creation\n    *   Fund transfers\n    *   Bill payments\n    *   Detailed transaction history\n    *   Customer service features\n    *   All other functionalities not explicitly listed in the \"In Scope\" section.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\nThe Smoke Suite will serve as the initial \"Health Check\" for each build. If any of these tests fail, the build is considered unstable and should be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Login Functionality**\n    *   Objective: Verify that users can successfully log in with valid credentials.\n    *   Steps:\n        1.  Navigate to the ParaBank homepage.\n        2.  Enter valid username and password.\n        3.  Click the \"Log In\" button.\n        4.  Verify that the user is redirected to the account overview page.\n*   **Test Case 2: Find Transactions Navigation**\n    *   Objective: Verify that the \"Find Transactions\" link is accessible and navigates to the correct page.\n    *   Steps:\n        1.  Log in to the application (as per Test Case 1).\n        2.  Click on the \"Find Transactions\" link in the navigation menu.\n        3.  Verify that the user is redirected to the \"Find Transactions\" page.\n*   **Test Case 3: About Us Navigation**\n    *   Objective: Verify that the \"About Us\" link is accessible and navigates to the correct page.\n    *   Steps:\n        1.  Navigate to the ParaBank homepage.\n        2.  Click on the \"About Us\" link in the footer.\n        3.  Verify that the user is redirected to the \"About Us\" page.\n\n### Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n*This section is for future regression testing and is not part of the initial smoke test strategy.*\n\n### Data Strategy\nFor the Smoke Tests, static test data (predefined usernames and passwords) will be used. This ensures consistency and predictability. For Regression Tests, a combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used to cover a wider range of scenarios.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### Framework Recommendation\nA Page Object Model (POM) structure is highly recommended for test automation. This will improve code maintainability, reusability, and readability.\n\n*   **Page Objects**: Each page of the ParaBank application should have a corresponding Page Object class. This class will contain:\n    *   Locators for all elements on the page (e.g., input fields, buttons, links).\n    *   Methods to interact with the elements (e.g., `enterUsername()`, `clickLoginButton()`).\n*   **Test Cases**: Test cases should use the Page Objects to interact with the application. This separates the test logic from the page implementation details.\n\n### Resilience Strategy\nFlakiness is a common issue in UI automation. To mitigate this:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., with WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to be in the expected state before interacting with them. This avoids timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits**: Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing**: Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically recover from common errors, such as element not found exceptions. This can involve retrying the action or using alternative locators.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### Mining Targets\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage**: Focus on identifying all links and form elements.\n2.  **Login Page**: Focus on identifying the username and password fields, and the login button.\n3.  **Account Overview Page**: Focus on identifying all links and account information.\n4.  **Find Transactions Page**: Focus on identifying all search criteria and transaction results.\n5.  **About Us Page**: Focus on identifying the main content and any contact information.\n\n### Verification Criteria\nSuccess is defined as:\n\n*   **HTTP 200**: The page loads successfully with an HTTP 200 status code.\n*   **Expected Elements Present**: All expected elements (e.g., input fields, buttons, links) are present on the page.\n*   **Correct Page Title**: The page title matches the expected title.\n*   **\"Welcome\" Text Visible (After Login)**: After successful login, the account overview page displays a \"Welcome\" message with the user's name."
