Core functionalities like account access and transaction processing are critical for business continuity and customer trust.\n\n### Risk Profile\nSystem failures in ParaBank can lead to:\n*   **Financial Loss**: Incorrect transactions or unauthorized access can result in direct monetary losses for both the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach**: Compromised personal and financial data can lead to identity theft and regulatory penalties.\n*   **Trust Loss**: Service disruptions and security vulnerabilities erode customer confidence, leading to account closures and reputational damage.\n\n### Testing Scope\n*   **In Scope**:\n    *   Account Access (Login, Logout)\n    *   Navigation to key pages (Find Transactions, About Us)\n    *   Basic UI elements on the specified pages.\n*   **Out of Scope**:\n    *   Transaction processing (Transfers, Bill Payments)\n    *   Account creation\n    *   Detailed data validation\n    *   Error handling and negative testing\n    *   API testing\n    *   Performance testing\n    *   Security testing (beyond basic login)\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially)\n    *   Mobile testing (initially)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\nThe Smoke Suite will serve as a rapid health check to ensure the core functionality of ParaBank is operational after each build.\n\n*   **Test Cases**:\n    1.  **Verify Login Page**:\n        *   Navigate to the login page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`).\n        *   Verify that the login form is present and functional.\n    2.  **Check Find Transactions Link**:\n        *   Navigate to the login page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`).\n        *   Login with valid credentials (e.g., `john`, `demo`).\n        *   Verify that the \"Find Transactions\" link is present and clickable.\n    3.  **Navigate to About Us**:\n        *   Navigate to the login page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`).\n        *   Verify that the \"About Us\" link is present and clickable.\n        *   Verify that clicking the link navigates to the \"About Us\" page.\n\n### Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n*   **Not Applicable**: Since this is a smoke test strategy, a regression suite is not defined at this stage.\n\n### Data Strategy\n*   **Static Data**: For the smoke tests, use a predefined set of valid credentials (e.g., `john`, `demo`). This ensures consistency and repeatability.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### Framework Recommendation\n*   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent each page as a class, with elements and actions as methods. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n\n### Resilience Strategy\n*   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable. This helps mitigate timing issues and flakiness.\n*   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially those involving network requests. This can help overcome transient issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### Mining Targets\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n2.  **Account Overview Page**: (Accessed after successful login)\n3.  **Find Transactions Page**: (Accessed via link on Account Overview)\n4.  **About Us Page**: (Accessed via link on the main page)\n\n### Verification Criteria\n*   **Success**:\n    *   **HTTP 200**: The page loads successfully (HTTP status code 200).\n    *   **Element Visibility**: Key elements (e.g., login form, links, headings) are visible on the page.\n    *   **Navigation**: Clicking links navigates to the expected pages.\n    *   **Login Success**: Successful login redirects to the Account Overview page.\n    *   **Text Verification**: Specific text elements (e.g., \"Welcome\", \"ParaBank\") are present on the page."
