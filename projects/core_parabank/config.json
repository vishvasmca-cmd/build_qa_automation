  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: ParaBank is a demo banking application. While not a real-world financial institution, it simulates core banking functionalities. The most critical areas are Account Access and Transactions.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failure in core functionalities (login, transactions) can lead to a loss of trust in a real-world scenario. Data breaches are a significant concern in banking.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Account Access (Login)\n        *   Navigation to key pages (Find Transactions, About Us)\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed transaction testing (beyond navigation)\n        *   Statement generation\n        *   Admin functionalities (if any)\n        *   API testing (unless explicitly required)\n        *   Performance testing\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic login)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Verify the core application is up and running and that basic navigation is functional.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Login Success**: Navigate to the login page, enter valid credentials, and verify successful login (e.g., account summary page is displayed).\n        2.  **Find Transactions Link**: Navigate to the Find Transactions page.\n        3.  **About Us Navigation**: Navigate to the \"About Us\" page.\n*   **Regression Suite**:\n    *   **Not applicable for this initial smoke test strategy.** Regression testing will be defined in a separate document after the smoke tests are stable.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   For the smoke tests, use a static set of valid credentials. These credentials should be stored securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets management system).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent each page as a class, with elements and actions as methods. This promotes maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) to handle potential timing issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., retry a test 1-2 times before marking it as failed).\n    *   **Self-Healing**: Consider implementing basic self-healing capabilities (e.g., automatically re-login if the session has expired).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Login Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm` (Focus on the login form)\n    2.  **Find Transactions Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/findtrans.htm` (Focus on navigation)\n    3.  **About Us Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/about.htm` (Focus on navigation)\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    1.  **Login Success**:\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of \"Account Services\" heading on the account summary page.\n    2.  **Find Transactions Link**:\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of \"Find Transactions\" heading on the page.\n    3.  **About Us Navigation**:\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of \"ParaSoft Demo Website\" text on the page."
