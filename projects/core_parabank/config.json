Any failures can lead to financial loss, data breaches, and a significant erosion of customer trust. The core functionalities, such as account access, fund transfers, and transaction history, are critical to the business.\n\n### Risk Profile\nThe risk profile for ParaBank is high. Failures in critical areas can result in:\n*   **Financial Loss**: Incorrect transactions, unauthorized access, or system downtime can lead to direct financial losses for both the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach**: Compromised customer data (account details, personal information) can result in legal repercussions and severe reputational damage.\n*   **Loss of Trust**: Frequent errors or security vulnerabilities can erode customer confidence, leading to account closures and loss of business.\n\n### Testing Scope\n**In Scope:**\n*   Account Access (Login, Logout)\n*   Navigation to key pages (Find Transactions, About Us)\n*   Basic UI element presence on key pages\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n*   Detailed transaction processing (transfers, bill payments)\n*   Statement generation and download\n*   Advanced search and filtering\n*   Error handling and negative testing\n*   Performance testing\n*   Security testing (beyond basic login)\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially)\n*   Mobile testing (initially)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\nThe Smoke Suite will serve as a rapid health check to ensure the application is in a usable state after deployments or infrastructure changes.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Verify Login Page**:\n        *   Navigate to the login page.\n        *   Verify the presence of username and password input fields.\n        *   Verify the presence of the login button.\n    2.  **Successful Login**:\n        *   Enter valid credentials (using predefined test data).\n        *   Verify successful redirection to the account overview page.\n    3.  **Find Transactions Link**:\n        *   Navigate to the account overview page (after login).\n        *   Verify the presence of the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n    4.  **About Us Navigation**:\n        *   Navigate to the \"About Us\" page.\n        *   Verify the page loads successfully.\n\n### Regression Suite\n*   **Not Applicable**: This document focuses on the Smoke Test Strategy. Regression test cases will be defined in a separate document.\n\n### Data Strategy\n*   **Static Test Data**: For the Smoke Suite, use a small set of predefined, static user credentials. These credentials should be stored securely and managed centrally.\n*   **Data Reset**: Ensure the test environment is reset to a known state before each Smoke Suite execution.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### Framework Recommendation\n*   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement the Page Object Model to represent each page as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Example: `LoginPage.java`, `AccountOverviewPage.java`, `AboutUsPage.java`\n    *   Each Page Object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n\n### Resilience Strategy\n*   **Explicit Waits**: Use explicit waits to handle dynamic loading of elements. Avoid hardcoded delays.\n*   **Polling Assertions**: For elements that may take time to appear or update, use polling assertions (e.g., retry logic with a timeout) to check for the expected state.\n*   **Self-Healing (Consider for future)**: Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common issues, such as stale element references.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### Mining Targets\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n2.  **Account Overview Page**: (Accessed after successful login)\n3.  **Find Transactions Page**: (Accessed via link on Account Overview)\n4.  **About Us Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/about.htm`\n\n### Verification Criteria\n*   **HTTP Status Code**: Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n*   **Page Title**: Verify that the page title matches the expected value for each page.\n*   **Element Presence**: Verify the presence of key UI elements on each page (e.g., login form, account summary table, \"About Us\" text).\n*   **Text Verification**: Verify the presence of specific text strings on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login)."
