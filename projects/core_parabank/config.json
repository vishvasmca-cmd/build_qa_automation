While not a real-world financial institution, failures can simulate real-world banking scenarios, impacting user trust and potentially exposing sensitive (albeit fake) data.\n*   **Risk Profile**:\n    *   **High**: Failure of core banking functions (login, transactions) leads to immediate user frustration and distrust.\n    *   **Medium**: Issues with secondary features (statements, customer service) impact user experience and potentially increase support costs.\n    *   **Low**: Problems with informational pages (About Us) have minimal direct impact.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Login functionality\n        *   Navigation to \"Find Transactions\" page\n        *   Navigation to \"About Us\" page\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   All other ParaBank functionalities beyond the specified user goal.\n        *   Detailed transaction testing (balances, transfers, etc.)\n        *   API testing\n        *   Performance testing\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic login)\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially)\n        *   Mobile testing (initially)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Purpose**: To ensure the core application is up and running and the specified critical paths are accessible.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  Verify the ParaBank homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  Verify successful login with valid credentials (pre-defined test user).\n        3.  Verify navigation to the \"Find Transactions\" page after login.\n        4.  Verify navigation to the \"About Us\" page from the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite**:\n    *   **Purpose**: N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Static Test Data**: Use a pre-defined set of valid login credentials for the smoke tests. This ensures consistency and repeatability. The username/password should be stored securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets management system).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the ParaBank application. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n        *   `HomePage`: Contains elements and methods related to the ParaBank homepage (e.g., login form, \"About Us\" link).\n        *   `LoginPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the login page.\n        *   `AccountsOverviewPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the accounts overview page after login.\n        *   `FindTransactionsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the \"Find Transactions\" page.\n        *   `AboutUsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the \"About Us\" page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., with explicit waits) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading. This reduces flakiness caused by asynchronous operations.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for critical actions (e.g., login) to handle transient network issues.\n    *   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to capture and log any exceptions that occur during test execution. This helps with debugging and identifying root causes.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Homepage**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n    2.  **Login Page**: (Accessed via the login form on the homepage)\n    3.  **Accounts Overview Page**: (Accessed after successful login)\n    4.  **Find Transactions Page**: (Accessed via a link on the Accounts Overview Page)\n    5.  **About Us Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/about.htm` (Accessed via a link on the homepage)\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Homepage**:\n        *   HTTP status code 200.\n        *   \"ParaBank\" text is visible in the header.\n        *   Login form is present.\n        *   \"About Us\" link is present.\n    *   **Login Page**:\n        *   HTTP status code 200.\n        *   Login form is present.\n    *   **Accounts Overview Page**:\n        *   HTTP status code 200.\n        *   \"Accounts Overview\" text is visible.\n        *   \"Find Transactions\" link is present.\n    *   **Find Transactions Page**:\n        *   HTTP status code 200.\n        *   \"Find Transactions\" text is visible.\n    *   **About Us Page**:\n        *   HTTP status code 200.\n        *   \"About Us\" text is visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the specified functionalities of the ParaBank application. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on critical paths and ensuring the core application is functioning as expected. This document will be updated as the project evolves and new requirements are identified."
