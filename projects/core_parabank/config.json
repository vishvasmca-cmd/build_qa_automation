  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nParaBank is a demonstration banking application. Within the banking domain, core functionalities like login and transaction history are critical. Failure in these areas directly impacts user access and trust.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nGiven that ParaBank is a demo application, the risk profile is relatively low compared to a real-world banking system. However, failures can still lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of User Trust:** If the application is consistently broken, users will lose confidence in its reliability.\n*   **Misleading Demonstrations:** Errors can misrepresent the capabilities of the underlying technology or the bank's services.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Login functionality.\n    *   Navigation to \"Find Transactions\" page.\n    *   Navigation to \"About Us\" page.\n    *   Basic page load and element rendering for the above.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   All other banking functionalities (account creation, transfers, bill payments, etc.).\n    *   Detailed transaction searching and filtering.\n    *   Form validation and error handling.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n    *   API testing.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a single, modern browser).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will consist of the following tests:\n\n1.  **Verify Login Page Loads:** Ensure the login page is accessible and renders correctly.\n2.  **Successful Login:** Verify a user can successfully log in with valid credentials.\n3.  **Find Transactions Link Navigation:** Verify the \"Find Transactions\" link is present and navigates to the correct page.\n4.  **About Us Navigation:** Verify the \"About Us\" link is present and navigates to the correct page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*Not applicable for the initial \"smoke\" testing focus.* A regression suite would be defined later, encompassing more detailed scenarios and edge cases.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nFor the smoke tests, static test data will be sufficient. This includes:\n\n*   **Valid Username:** A known valid username for login.\n*   **Valid Password:** The corresponding password for the valid username.\n\n*Note: For future regression testing, a more robust data strategy involving dynamic data generation and data cleanup would be required.*\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nA Page Object Model (POM) structure is highly recommended for maintainability and scalability.\n\n*   **Page Objects:** Create separate classes for each page (e.g., LoginPage, FindTransactionsPage, AboutUsPage). These classes encapsulate the page's elements and actions.\n*   **Test Cases:** Test cases should interact with the application solely through the Page Objects.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\nFlakiness can be addressed with the following strategies:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Instead of immediately failing an assertion, retry it for a short period (e.g., 5 seconds) to account for occasional delays.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n*   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors, such as re-locating elements if their locators change slightly. *Note: This is a more advanced technique and may not be necessary for the initial smoke tests.*\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages/flows FIRST:\n\n1.  **Homepage (https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm):** Focus on the login form and the \"About Us\" and \"Find Transactions\" links.\n2.  **Login Page (reached via Homepage):** Focus on successful login.\n3.  **Find Transactions Page (reached via Homepage):** Verify page load.\n4.  **About Us Page (reached via Homepage):** Verify page load.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\nSuccess is defined as:\n\n*   **HTTP 200 Status Code:** Each page load should return an HTTP 200 status code, indicating success.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Key elements on each page should be visible (e.g., login form on the homepage, specific text on the \"About Us\" page).\n*   **Successful Login:** After submitting valid credentials, the user should be redirected to the account overview page.\n*   **Correct Page Navigation:** Clicking the \"Find Transactions\" and \"About Us\" links should navigate to the correct pages without errors.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the ParaBank application. It prioritizes critical functionalities and sets the foundation for a robust and maintainable test automation framework."

  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### Domain Analysis\nParaBank operates within the banking domain, making the security and reliability of its financial services paramount. Core functionalities like account access and transaction processing are critical for business continuity and customer trust.\n\n### Risk Profile\nSystem failures in ParaBank can lead to:\n*   **Financial Loss**: Incorrect transactions or unauthorized access can result in direct monetary losses for both the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach**: Compromised personal and financial data can lead to identity theft and regulatory penalties.\n*   **Trust Loss**: Service disruptions and security vulnerabilities erode customer confidence, leading to account closures and reputational damage.\n\n### Testing Scope\n*   **In Scope**:\n    *   Account Access (Login, Logout)\n    *   Navigation to key pages (Find Transactions, About Us)\n    *   Basic UI elements on the specified pages.\n*   **Out of Scope**:\n    *   Transaction processing (Transfers, Bill Payments)\n    *   Account creation\n    *   Detailed data validation\n    *   Error handling and negative testing\n    *   API testing\n    *   Performance testing\n    *   Security testing (beyond basic login)\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially)\n    *   Mobile testing (initially)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\nThe Smoke Suite will serve as a rapid health check to ensure the core functionality of ParaBank is operational after each build.\n\n*   **Test Cases**:\n    1.  **Verify Login Page**:\n        *   Navigate to the login page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`).\n        *   Verify that the login form is present and functional.\n    2.  **Check Find Transactions Link**:\n        *   Navigate to the login page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`).\n        *   Login with valid credentials (e.g., `john`, `demo`).\n        *   Verify that the \"Find Transactions\" link is present and clickable.\n    3.  **Navigate to About Us**:\n        *   Navigate to the login page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`).\n        *   Verify that the \"About Us\" link is present and clickable.\n        *   Verify that clicking the link navigates to the \"About Us\" page.\n\n### Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n*   **Not Applicable**: Since this is a smoke test strategy, a regression suite is not defined at this stage.\n\n### Data Strategy\n*   **Static Data**: For the smoke tests, use a predefined set of valid credentials (e.g., `john`, `demo`). This ensures consistency and repeatability.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### Framework Recommendation\n*   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent each page as a class, with elements and actions as methods. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n\n### Resilience Strategy\n*   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable. This helps mitigate timing issues and flakiness.\n*   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially those involving network requests. This can help overcome transient issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### Mining Targets\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n2.  **Account Overview Page**: (Accessed after successful login)\n3.  **Find Transactions Page**: (Accessed via link on Account Overview)\n4.  **About Us Page**: (Accessed via link on the main page)\n\n### Verification Criteria\n*   **Success**:\n    *   **HTTP 200**: The page loads successfully (HTTP status code 200).\n    *   **Element Visibility**: Key elements (e.g., login form, links, headings) are visible on the page.\n    *   **Navigation**: Clicking links navigates to the expected pages.\n    *   **Login Success**: Successful login redirects to the Account Overview page.\n    *   **Text Verification**: Specific text elements (e.g., \"Welcome\", \"ParaBank\") are present on the page."
