While not a real-world financial institution, failures can simulate real-world banking scenarios, impacting user trust and potentially exposing sensitive data (in a real system).\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Failure of core banking functions (login, transactions) leads to immediate user frustration and potential financial impact.\n    *   **Medium:** Issues with statement access or profile management degrade user experience and trust.\n    *   **Low:** Problems with informational pages (like \"About Us\") have minimal direct impact.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope (Smoke):**\n        *   Successful Login\n        *   Navigation to \"Find Transactions\" page\n        *   Navigation to \"About Us\" page\n    *   **Out of Scope (for Smoke):**\n        *   All transaction-related functionality (transfers, bill pay, etc.)\n        *   Account creation/management\n        *   Detailed transaction searching/filtering\n        *   Statement downloads\n        *   Error handling (invalid login attempts, etc.)\n        *   UI/UX validation (beyond basic page load)\n        *   Performance testing\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core application is up and running and that basic navigation is functional.\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After every build deployment.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Login Success:**\n            *   Navigate to `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n            *   Enter valid username and password.\n            *   Verify successful login (e.g., account summary page is displayed).\n        2.  **Find Transactions Navigation:**\n            *   Navigate to `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n            *   Login with valid credentials.\n            *   Click on the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n            *   Verify the \"Find Transactions\" page loads successfully.\n        3.  **About Us Navigation:**\n            *   Navigate to `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n            *   Click on the \"About Us\" link.\n            *   Verify the \"About Us\" page loads successfully.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** *This is outside the scope of the current request, but would include:*\n    *   All functionality listed as \"Out of Scope\" above.\n    *   Positive and negative test cases for each feature.\n    *   Boundary value analysis.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility testing.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Smoke Tests:** Use a static, pre-defined set of valid credentials for the smoke tests. This ensures consistency and avoids dependency on external data sources.\n    *   **Regression Tests:** *This is outside the scope of the current request, but would include:* Consider a mix of static and dynamically generated data for regression testing. Dynamic data generation is crucial for testing edge cases and boundary conditions.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM). This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability. Each page of the application should be represented by a Page Object class, encapsulating the elements and actions specific to that page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them. This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues.\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions (retry logic) for elements that may take time to appear or update. This is especially useful for asynchronous operations.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically recover from minor UI changes. This could involve using AI-powered element locators or fallback strategies.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Home Page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`):** Focus on the login form and the \"About Us\" link.\n    2.  **Account Summary Page (after login):** Focus on the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Login Success:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of Account Summary elements (e.g., \"Accounts Overview\" heading, account list).\n    2.  **Find Transactions Navigation:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of \"Find Transactions\" heading.\n    3.  **About Us Navigation:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of \"ParaSoft Demo Website\" heading."
