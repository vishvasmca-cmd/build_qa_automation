  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** ParaBank is a demonstration banking application. While not a real-world financial institution, failures can simulate real-world banking scenarios, impacting user trust and potentially exposing sensitive data (in a real system).\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Failure of core banking functions (login, transactions) leads to immediate user frustration and potential financial impact.\n    *   **Medium:** Issues with statement access or profile management degrade user experience and trust.\n    *   **Low:** Problems with informational pages (like \"About Us\") have minimal direct impact.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope (Smoke):**\n        *   Successful Login\n        *   Navigation to \"Find Transactions\" page\n        *   Navigation to \"About Us\" page\n    *   **Out of Scope (for Smoke):**\n        *   All transaction-related functionality (transfers, bill pay, etc.)\n        *   Account creation/management\n        *   Detailed transaction searching/filtering\n        *   Statement downloads\n        *   Error handling (invalid login attempts, etc.)\n        *   UI/UX validation (beyond basic page load)\n        *   Performance testing\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core application is up and running and that basic navigation is functional.\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After every build deployment.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Login Success:**\n            *   Navigate to `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n            *   Enter valid username and password.\n            *   Verify successful login (e.g., account summary page is displayed).\n        2.  **Find Transactions Navigation:**\n            *   Navigate to `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n            *   Login with valid credentials.\n            *   Click on the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n            *   Verify the \"Find Transactions\" page loads successfully.\n        3.  **About Us Navigation:**\n            *   Navigate to `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n            *   Click on the \"About Us\" link.\n            *   Verify the \"About Us\" page loads successfully.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** *This is outside the scope of the current request, but would include:*\n    *   All functionality listed as \"Out of Scope\" above.\n    *   Positive and negative test cases for each feature.\n    *   Boundary value analysis.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility testing.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Smoke Tests:** Use a static, pre-defined set of valid credentials for the smoke tests. This ensures consistency and avoids dependency on external data sources.\n    *   **Regression Tests:** *This is outside the scope of the current request, but would include:* Consider a mix of static and dynamically generated data for regression testing. Dynamic data generation is crucial for testing edge cases and boundary conditions.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM). This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability. Each page of the application should be represented by a Page Object class, encapsulating the elements and actions specific to that page.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them. This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues.\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions (retry logic) for elements that may take time to appear or update. This is especially useful for asynchronous operations.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically recover from minor UI changes. This could involve using AI-powered element locators or fallback strategies.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Home Page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`):** Focus on the login form and the \"About Us\" link.\n    2.  **Account Summary Page (after login):** Focus on the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Login Success:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of Account Summary elements (e.g., \"Accounts Overview\" heading, account list).\n    2.  **Find Transactions Navigation:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of \"Find Transactions\" heading.\n    3.  **About Us Navigation:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of \"ParaSoft Demo Website\" heading."

  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nParaBank operates in the **banking** domain. This domain is inherently high-risk due to the sensitive nature of financial transactions and personal data. Any system failure can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect transactions, unauthorized access, or system downtime can directly result in monetary losses for both the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised personal or financial data can lead to identity theft, fraud, and severe reputational damage.\n*   **Trust Loss:** Banking relies heavily on trust. System failures erode customer confidence and can lead to account closures and loss of business.\n\nGiven these risks, a robust and comprehensive testing strategy is paramount.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nParaBank's risk profile is **high**. The application handles sensitive financial data and any failure can have significant consequences. Specific risks include:\n\n*   **Authentication Failures:** Inability to log in or unauthorized access to accounts.\n*   **Transaction Errors:** Incorrect fund transfers, failed payments, or inaccurate account balances.\n*   **Data Security Vulnerabilities:** Exposure of personal or financial data to unauthorized parties.\n*   **System Downtime:** Inability to access the system during critical periods.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope (For Smoke Testing):**\n\n*   **Login Page:** Functionality and security of the login process.\n*   **Find Transactions Link:** Navigation and basic functionality of the transaction search feature.\n*   **About Us Page:** Accessibility and content of the \"About Us\" page.\n\n**Out of Scope (For Smoke Testing):**\n\n*   Account creation\n*   Fund transfers\n*   Bill payments\n*   Detailed transaction history\n*   Customer service features\n*   All other functionalities beyond the specified smoke test objectives.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will serve as a \"health check\" to ensure the core functionality of ParaBank is operational after each build or deployment.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Login Success:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n    2.  **Find Transactions Link:** Verify the \"Find Transactions\" link is present and navigates to the correct page.\n    3.  **About Us Navigation:** Verify the \"About Us\" link is present and navigates to the correct page.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After every build and deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All smoke tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Account Access (Criticality: Critical)**\n    *   [SMOKE CANDIDATES] (Must Verify):\n        *   Customer Login\n    *   [REGRESSION CANDIDATES] (Variations/Edges):\n        *   Login with Biometrics/MFA (if applicable)\n        *   Recover Forgotten Username/Password\n        *   Session Timeout Handling\n\n*   **Transfers & Payments (Criticality: Critical)**\n    *   [SMOKE CANDIDATES] (Must Verify):\n        *   Internal Fund Transfer (Checking to Savings)\n    *   [REGRESSION CANDIDATES] (Variations/Edges):\n        *   Transfer exceeding balance (Insufficient Funds)\n        *   Transfer exceeding daily limit\n        *   Schedule Future Date Transfer\n        *   Add New Payee/Beneficiary\n\n*   **Statements & History (Criticality: Medium)**\n    *   [SMOKE CANDIDATES] (Must Verify):\n        *   View Recent Transactions\n    *   [REGRESSION CANDIDATES] (Variations/Edges):\n        *   Download Statement (PDF/CSV)\n        *   Search Transactions by Keyword\n        *   Filter Transactions by Amount Range\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Smoke Tests:** Use a small set of **static** test data (e.g., a known valid username and password). This data should be simple and easily maintainable.\n*   **Regression Tests:** Employ a mix of **static** and **dynamic** test data.\n    *   **Static Data:** Use for common scenarios and boundary value analysis.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Generate data on-the-fly for scenarios requiring unique values (e.g., creating new accounts, scheduling future transactions).  Consider using a data generation library (e.g., Faker) to create realistic and varied data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nImplement a **Page Object Model (POM)** structure. This will improve code maintainability and reduce duplication.\n\n*   **Page Objects:** Represent each page of the application as a class. Each class should contain:\n    *   Locators for all elements on the page (e.g., input fields, buttons, links).\n    *   Methods to interact with the elements on the page (e.g., `login()`, `clickFindTransactions()`).\n*   **Test Cases:** Test cases should interact with the application through the Page Objects.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\nAddress potential test flakiness with the following strategies:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with retry mechanisms) to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met. This is especially useful for asynchronous operations.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically recover from common issues, such as element locators that change frequently.  This could involve using multiple locators for the same element and automatically switching to a working locator if one fails.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `/parabank/index.htm`\n2.  **Find Transactions Page:** `/parabank/findtrans.htm` (reached via the \"Find Transactions\" link after login)\n3.  **About Us Page:** `/parabank/about.htm`\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Login Page:**\n    *   **Success:** HTTP 200 AND \"Welcome\" text is visible after successful login.\n    *   **Failure:** Appropriate error message is displayed for invalid credentials.\n*   **Find Transactions Page:**\n    *   **Success:** HTTP 200 AND the page contains elements for searching transactions (e.g., \"By Account\", \"By Date Range\").\n*   **About Us Page:**\n    *   **Success:** HTTP 200 AND the page contains information about ParaBank (e.g., company description, contact information)."
