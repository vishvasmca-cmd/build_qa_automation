While not a real-world financial institution, failures can simulate real-world banking scenarios, impacting user trust and potentially exposing sensitive data (in a real application). The core business functions revolve around account access, fund transfers, and transaction history.\n*   **Risk Profile**:\n    *   **High**: Failure of login or fund transfer functionality. This could lead to inability to access accounts or incorrect financial transactions.\n    *   **Medium**: Failure to view transaction history or access account statements. This impacts user's ability to manage their finances.\n    *   **Low**: Failure of informational pages (e.g., \"About Us\").\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Account Access (Login/Logout)\n        *   Navigation to key pages (Find Transactions, About Us)\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Detailed transaction processing (beyond basic navigation)\n        *   External system integrations (if any)\n        *   Performance testing\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic login)\n        *   All other functionalities not explicitly mentioned in the user goal.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Purpose**: To quickly verify the core functionality of the application after deployment or code changes.\n    *   **Execution Frequency**: After each build, deployment, or configuration change.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Login Success**: Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n        2.  **Find Transactions Navigation**: Verify navigation to the \"Find Transactions\" page.\n        3.  **About Us Navigation**: Verify navigation to the \"About Us\" page.\n*   **Regression Suite**:\n    *   **Purpose**: *Not applicable for this \"smoke\" focused strategy.* A full regression suite would be defined later to ensure existing functionality remains intact after changes.\n    *   **Execution Frequency**: *Not applicable for this \"smoke\" focused strategy.*\n    *   **Test Cases**: *Not applicable for this \"smoke\" focused strategy.*\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Approach**: Static test data.\n    *   **Details**: Use pre-defined, valid usernames and passwords for the smoke tests. This simplifies the testing process and ensures consistency.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Rationale**: POM allows for easy updates to test scripts when UI changes occur.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) to handle potential timing issues during page loads.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., retry a test 1-2 times before marking it as failed).\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Login Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n    2.  **Find Transactions Page**: (Target URL after successful login and navigation)\n    3.  **About Us Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/about.htm`\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    1.  **Login Success**:\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of \"Accounts Overview\" text on the page after login.\n    2.  **Find Transactions Navigation**:\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of \"Find Transactions\" heading on the page.\n    3.  **About Us Navigation**:\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200\n        *   Presence of \"ParaBank\" text on the page."
