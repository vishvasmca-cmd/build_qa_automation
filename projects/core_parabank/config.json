  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nParaBank is a demonstration banking application. The core business functions revolve around account access, fund transfers, bill payments, and statement management. Given the financial nature of the application, data integrity and security are paramount.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure of ParaBank can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect transactions or inability to access funds.\n*   **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive customer information.\n*   **Trust Loss:** Damage to the bank's reputation and customer confidence.\n*   **Availability Issues:** Inability to access the system.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope (For Smoke Testing):**\n\n*   Account Access (Login)\n*   Navigation to \"Find Transactions\" page\n*   Navigation to \"About Us\" page\n\n**Out of Scope (For Smoke Testing):**\n\n*   All other functionalities beyond the specified navigation and login.\n*   Detailed transaction processing.\n*   Statement generation and download.\n*   Admin functionalities (if any).\n*   Negative testing (invalid credentials, etc.).\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing (beyond basic access).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will focus on verifying the basic health of the application. If any of these tests fail, the build should be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Login**\n    *   Navigate to the login page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`).\n    *   Enter valid username and password.\n    *   Verify successful login by checking for the presence of the account overview page.\n*   **Test Case 2: Find Transactions Navigation**\n    *   Navigate to the login page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`).\n    *   Enter valid username and password.\n    *   Click on the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n    *   Verify that the \"Find Transactions\" page loads successfully.\n*   **Test Case 3: About Us Navigation**\n    *   Navigate to the login page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`).\n    *   Click on the \"About Us\" link.\n    *   Verify that the \"About Us\" page loads successfully.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*This section is not applicable for the current smoke test strategy. It will be defined in a separate document for regression testing.*\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nFor smoke tests, static test data will be sufficient. This data should include at least one valid user account.\n\n*   **Static Data:** A predefined set of usernames and passwords for valid user accounts. This data should be stored securely and managed appropriately.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nA Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended for maintainability and reusability.\n\n*   **LoginPage:** Contains elements and methods related to the login page.\n*   **AccountOverviewPage:** Contains elements and methods related to the account overview page.\n*   **FindTransactionsPage:** Contains elements and methods related to the \"Find Transactions\" page.\n*   **AboutUsPage:** Contains elements and methods related to the \"About Us\" page.\n*   **BasePage:** A base class for all page objects, containing common functionalities like navigation and element retrieval.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\nFlakiness can be addressed with the following strategies:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met, instead of relying on fixed timeouts.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for network-related issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`)\n2.  **Account Overview Page:** (Accessed after successful login)\n3.  **Find Transactions Page:** (Accessed via link on Account Overview Page)\n4.  **About Us Page:** (Accessed via link on the main page)\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\nSuccess is defined by the following criteria:\n\n*   **HTTP 200 Status Code:** All page requests should return an HTTP 200 status code, indicating successful retrieval.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Key elements on each page should be visible (e.g., \"Welcome\" text on the Account Overview page, \"Find Transactions\" heading on the Find Transactions page).\n*   **Successful Login:** After entering valid credentials, the user should be redirected to the Account Overview page.\n*   **Correct Page Load:** When navigating to \"Find Transactions\" and \"About Us\", the correct page content should be displayed."
