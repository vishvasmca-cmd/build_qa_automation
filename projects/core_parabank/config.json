Any failures can lead to financial loss, data breaches, and a significant erosion of customer trust. Core functionalities like account access, fund transfers, and transaction history must be rigorously tested.\n\n### Risk Profile\nThe risk profile for ParaBank is high. Failures in critical areas can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss**: Incorrect transactions, unauthorized access, or system downtime can directly impact customer finances.\n*   **Data Breach**: Compromised personal or financial data can lead to legal and reputational damage.\n*   **Loss of Trust**: Frequent errors or security vulnerabilities can erode customer confidence and lead to attrition.\n\n### Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope**:\n    *   Account Access (Login, Logout)\n    *   Navigation to key pages (Find Transactions, About Us)\n    *   Basic UI element presence on key pages\n*   **Out of Scope**:\n    *   Detailed transaction processing (fund transfers, bill payments)\n    *   Statement generation\n    *   Customer service features\n    *   Detailed error handling and edge cases\n    *   Performance testing\n    *   Security testing (beyond basic login)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will focus on verifying the core functionality required to access the application and navigate to key areas.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Verify Login Page**:\n        *   Navigate to the login page (`https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`).\n        *   Verify that the login form is present (username, password fields, login button).\n        *   Attempt to log in with valid credentials.\n        *   Verify successful login and redirection to the account overview page.\n    2.  **Check Find Transactions Link**:\n        *   From the account overview page, verify the presence of the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n        *   Click the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n        *   Verify that the \"Find Transactions\" page loads successfully.\n    3.  **Navigate to About Us**:\n        *   From any page, verify the presence of the \"About Us\" link.\n        *   Click the \"About Us\" link.\n        *   Verify that the \"About Us\" page loads successfully.\n\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   Use a static set of valid credentials for the login test. These credentials should be stored securely and managed appropriately.\n\n### Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Not Applicable**: This is a Smoke Test Strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent each page as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   `LoginPage`: Encapsulates the login form and related actions.\n    *   `AccountOverviewPage`: Represents the account overview page and its elements.\n    *   `FindTransactionsPage`: Represents the \"Find Transactions\" page.\n    *   `AboutUsPage`: Represents the \"About Us\" page.\n\n### Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions to handle potential timing issues when loading pages or elements. This will reduce flakiness caused by asynchronous operations.\n*   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for critical actions like login, in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n2.  **Account Overview Page**: (Reached after successful login)\n3.  **Find Transactions Page**: (Linked from Account Overview)\n4.  **About Us Page**: (Linked from any page)\n\n### Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Criteria**:\n    *   **HTTP Status Code**: All page requests should return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Page Content**:\n        *   Login Page: Verify the presence of the login form elements (username, password, login button).\n        *   Account Overview Page: Verify the presence of account information and the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n        *   Find Transactions Page: Verify the presence of the transaction search form.\n        *   About Us Page: Verify the presence of the \"ParaSoft\" company information.\n    *   **Login Success**: Successful login should redirect to the Account Overview page.\n*   **Failure Criteria**:\n    *   HTTP status codes other than 200.\n    *   Missing key elements on the pages.\n    *   Login failure with valid credentials.\n    *   Exceptions or errors during page load."
