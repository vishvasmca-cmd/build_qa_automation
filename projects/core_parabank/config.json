Any failures can lead to financial loss, data breaches, and a significant erosion of customer trust. Core functionalities like account access, fund transfers, and transaction history must be rigorously tested.\n\n### Risk Profile\nThe risk profile for ParaBank is **high**. Failures in core banking functions can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss**: Incorrect transactions, unauthorized access, or system downtime can lead to direct financial losses for both the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach**: Security vulnerabilities can expose sensitive customer data, leading to legal and reputational damage.\n*   **Loss of Trust**: Frequent system failures or security breaches can erode customer trust, leading to account closures and loss of business.\n*   **Compliance Issues**: Banking systems are subject to strict regulatory requirements. Failures to comply can result in fines and legal action.\n\n### Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope**:\n    *   Account Access (Login, Logout)\n    *   Navigation to key pages (Find Transactions, About Us)\n    *   Basic UI elements and their functionality on the specified pages.\n*   **Out of Scope**:\n    *   Detailed transaction processing (transfers, bill payments, etc.)\n    *   Statement generation and download\n    *   Advanced security features (biometrics, MFA)\n    *   Performance testing\n    *   Detailed error handling and edge cases\n    *   API testing (focus is on UI)\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will serve as a rapid health check to ensure the core functionality of ParaBank is operational after each build.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Verify Successful Login**:\n        *   Navigate to the login page.\n        *   Enter valid username and password.\n        *   Verify successful login and redirection to the account overview page.\n    2.  **Verify Find Transactions Link**:\n        *   Navigate to the account overview page (after login).\n        *   Click on the \"Find Transactions\" link.\n        *   Verify that the \"Find Transactions\" page loads successfully.\n    3.  **Verify About Us Navigation**:\n        *   Navigate to the main page.\n        *   Click on the \"About Us\" link.\n        *   Verify that the \"About Us\" page loads successfully.\n\n### Regression Suite (Future Expansion)\n\n*   **Account Access**:\n    *   Invalid Login Attempts (check error messages)\n    *   Password Reset Flow\n    *   Session Timeout Handling\n*   **Transfers & Payments**:\n    *   Internal Fund Transfer (Checking to Savings)\n    *   Bill Payment (Standard)\n    *   Transfer exceeding balance (Insufficient Funds)\n*   **Statements & History**:\n    *   View Recent Transactions\n    *   Download Statement (PDF/CSV)\n    *   Search Transactions by Keyword\n\n### Data Strategy\n\nFor the initial Smoke Suite, **static test data** (predefined usernames and passwords) will be used for simplicity and speed. This data should be stored securely and managed centrally.\n\nIn the future, for the Regression Suite, a more robust data strategy will be required, potentially involving:\n\n*   **Dynamic Test Data Generation**: Creating new accounts and transactions programmatically.\n*   **Data Masking**: Ensuring sensitive data is masked or anonymized in test environments.\n*   **Database Seeding**: Populating the database with realistic test data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### Framework Recommendation\n\nA **Page Object Model (POM)** structure is highly recommended for test automation. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n\n*   **Page Objects**: Each page of the ParaBank application should have a corresponding Page Object class. This class encapsulates the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n*   **Test Cases**: Test cases should interact with the application through the Page Objects, rather than directly manipulating UI elements.\n*   **Base Test Class**: A base test class should provide common setup and teardown methods, as well as utility functions for interacting with the browser.\n\n### Resilience Strategy\n\nFlakiness is a common challenge in UI automation. To mitigate this, the following strategies should be implemented:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions**: Instead of immediately failing an assertion, retry it for a short period of time. This can help to account for occasional delays in UI rendering.\n*   **Explicit Waits**: Use explicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n*   **Self-Healing**: Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors, such as stale element exceptions. This might involve refreshing the page or re-locating the element.\n*   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests. This can help to reduce the impact of intermittent failures.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### Mining Targets\n\nFor the initial exploration, the autonomous agent should focus on the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm`\n2.  **Account Overview Page**: (Accessed after successful login)\n3.  **Find Transactions Page**: (Accessed via link on Account Overview)\n4.  **About Us Page**: `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/about.htm`\n\n### Verification Criteria\n\nThe following criteria define \"Success\" for the Smoke Suite:\n\n*   **Login Page**:\n    *   HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   \"ParaBank\" text is visible.\n    *   Login form is present (username, password fields, login button).\n*   **Account Overview Page**:\n    *   HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   \"Welcome\" text is visible, indicating successful login.\n    *   Account list is present.\n    *   \"Find Transactions\" link is visible.\n*   **Find Transactions Page**:\n    *   HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   \"Find Transactions\" heading is visible.\n    *   Search form is present.\n*   **About Us Page**:\n    *   HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   \"ParaBank\" and \"About Us\" text is visible.\n    *   Company information is displayed."
