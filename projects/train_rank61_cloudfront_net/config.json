  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Cloudfront.net - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nCloudfront.net appears to be a website for a cloud service provider, likely offering content delivery network (CDN) and related services. The business criticality is high, as website availability and core functionality directly impact customer acquisition, service delivery, and overall business reputation.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the website's core functionality (e.g., inability to load the homepage, broken links, non-functional signup) can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Potential Customers:** Users unable to access the site or sign up may choose competitors.\n*   **Damage to Brand Reputation:** A non-functional website reflects poorly on the company's reliability and technical competence.\n*   **Reduced Service Adoption:** If users cannot easily explore the services offered, adoption rates will suffer.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope (Smoke Tests):**\n\n*   Website Homepage Load\n*   Presence and basic functionality of key elements:\n    *   Login Button/Link\n    *   Signup/Get Started Button/Link\n    *   \"Try for Free\" Button/Link (or similar call-to-action)\n    *   Any 5 prominent buttons/links on the homepage\n    *   2 prominent links on the homepage\n    *   2 Menu Bars (verify presence, not functionality)\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed functionality of individual features or services.\n*   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n*   Performance testing (e.g., load times).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (beyond a single, primary browser).\n*   Mobile device testing.\n*   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n*   Form submission.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of automated tests designed to quickly verify the core functionality of the Cloudfront.net website.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Homepage Load:**\n    *   Objective: Verify the website homepage loads successfully.\n    *   Steps: Navigate to `https://cloudfront.net`.\n    *   Verification: HTTP status code is 200, and the page title is present.\n*   **Test Case 2: Key Element Presence:**\n    *   Objective: Verify the presence of critical buttons and links.\n    *   Steps: Inspect the DOM (Document Object Model) of the homepage.\n    *   Verification:\n        *   Login Button/Link is present and visible.\n        *   Signup/Get Started Button/Link is present and visible.\n        *   \"Try for Free\" Button/Link (or similar) is present and visible.\n        *   5 other prominent buttons/links are present and visible.\n        *   2 prominent links are present and visible.\n        *   2 Menu Bars are present and visible.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*   **Not Applicable:** This document focuses solely on the Smoke Test Strategy. A separate Regression Test Strategy will be defined later.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** Smoke tests will primarily rely on static data. No dynamic data generation is required for the scope of these tests.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the homepage and its elements. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` class containing locators for all the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n    *   Define methods within the `HomePage` class to verify the presence and visibility of these elements.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for elements to load. This will reduce flakiness.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to become visible before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should focus on the following areas:\n\n*   **Homepage (`https://cloudfront.net`):** This is the primary target for identifying the required buttons, links, and menu bars.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   All smoke tests pass consistently.\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for the homepage.\n    *   All specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present and visible on the homepage.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   Any smoke test fails.\n    *   HTTP status code other than 200 for the homepage.\n    *   Any of the specified buttons, links, or menu bars are missing or not visible on the homepage.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing smoke tests on Cloudfront.net. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on verifying the core functionality of the website to ensure a positive user experience and minimize potential business impact."
