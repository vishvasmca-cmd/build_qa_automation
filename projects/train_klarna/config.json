  "master_plan": "# Master Test Plan: Klarna Website Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior QA Strategist\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for conducting smoke tests on the Klarna website (https://www.klarna.com). The purpose of this plan is to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational and meets the defined user goals. This plan will serve as a guide for autonomous agents to mine, verify, and structure the test suite.\n\n## 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\n**Target URL:** https://www.klarna.com\n**Business Domain:** Banking / Financial Services / E-commerce Payment Solutions\n**Domain Analysis:**\n\n*   **Klarna's Core Business:** Klarna provides \"buy now, pay later\" services, direct payments, and financing options for online and in-store purchases. The website serves as a central hub for customers to learn about these services, manage their accounts, and access support.\n*   **Target Audience:** Consumers looking for flexible payment options, merchants seeking to integrate Klarna's payment solutions.\n*   **Key Website Functions:**\n    *   Informational pages describing Klarna's services (Pay in 4, financing, etc.)\n    *   Merchant-focused content (integration, pricing)\n    *   Customer account management portal\n    *   Support/Help center\n    *   Mobile App download links\n*   **Testing Considerations:** The financial nature of the domain necessitates a focus on security, data privacy, and accurate financial calculations.\n\n## 3. Scope of Testing (Smoke Suite)\n\nThis Master Test Plan focuses on smoke testing, which aims to verify the most critical functionalities of the Klarna website. The tests are designed to be quick and efficient, providing a high-level assessment of the site's health.\n\n### 3.1 Test Objectives\n\n*   Verify the website is accessible and responsive.\n*   Ensure core navigation links are functional.\n*   Validate a key user flow: Finding and initiating a core action.\n\n### 3.2 In-Scope\n\n*   Homepage accessibility.\n*   Core navigation menu links.\n*   Verification of key marketing headline.\n*   \"Get the App\" button functionality.\n\n### 3.3 Out-of-Scope\n\n*   Detailed testing of individual payment options.\n*   Merchant-specific functionalities.\n*   User account management.\n*   Accessibility compliance (WCAG).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility beyond the primary target browser (Chrome).\n*   Performance testing (load, stress).\n*   Security testing.\n\n## 4. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the following test cases:\n\n**Test Case 1: Website Availability**\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the Klarna website is accessible and returns a successful HTTP status code.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.klarna.com.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   Website loads successfully with HTTP status code 200.\n\n**Test Case 2: Core Navigation**\n\n*   **Description:** Verify that the main navigation links are present and navigable.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.klarna.com.\n    2.  Identify the main navigation menu.\n    3.  Click on each of the main menu items (e.g., \"Products\", \"Where to Shop\", \"Support\", or similar - agent to determine actual text).\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   Each menu link should navigate to a relevant page without errors.\n\n**Test Case 3: Core Flow - Verify Headline and Get the App Button**\n\n*   **Description:** Navigates to Klarna homepage. Verify the hero headline contains 'Pay in 4 for your purchases'. Find and click the 'Get the App' button.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.klarna.com.\n    2.  Locate the main hero headline on the homepage.\n    3.  Verify that the headline text contains the phrase \"Pay in 4 for your purchases\".\n    4.  Locate the \"Get the App\" button on the homepage.\n    5.  Click the \"Get the App\" button.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The main headline is found and contains the specified text.\n    *   The \"Get the App\" button is found and clickable.\n    *   Clicking the button navigates the user to the application download page, or displays a modal with app download options (agent to determine actual behavior).\n\n## 5. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents\n\nThe following instructions are designed to guide autonomous agents in identifying relevant elements and prioritizing their testing efforts:\n\n*   **Homepage Analysis:** The agent should prioritize identifying the main hero section of the homepage. This is where the primary marketing message and \"Get the App\" button are likely located. Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<main>`, `<section>`) or ARIA roles (e.g., `role=\"main\"`) to help identify this section.\n*   **Headline Identification:** Once the main hero section is identified, the agent should look for the primary headline element (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`) within that section. The agent should extract the text from this element and verify that it contains the expected phrase.\n*   **Button Identification:** The agent should look for a button element with the text \"Get the App\" (case-insensitive). Alternative phrases like \"Download the App\" or \"Get Klarna App\" should also be considered. The agent should prioritize buttons with clear visual cues (e.g., a download icon).\n*   **Navigation Menu:** The agent should identify the main navigation menu using semantic HTML (e.g., `<nav>`) or ARIA roles (e.g., `role=\"navigation\"`). The agent should extract all the `<a>` tags within the navigation menu and verify that they point to valid URLs.\n*   **Dynamic Content:** Be aware that the website may use dynamic content or A/B testing, which could result in variations in the headline text or button placement. The agent should be able to adapt to these variations and still identify the core elements.\n*   **Error Handling:** The agent should be able to gracefully handle errors, such as elements not being found or network requests failing. The agent should log these errors and provide informative messages.\n\n## 6. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Google Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:** Platform independent (Windows, macOS, Linux) - tested in agent's environment.\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection.\n\n## 7. Test Data\n\nNo specific test data is required for the smoke tests, as the tests focus on verifying the functionality of existing elements and links.\n\n## 8. Test Execution\n\n*   The autonomous agent will execute the test cases defined in Section 4.\n*   The agent will record the results of each test case, including any errors or failures.\n*   A test report will be generated, summarizing the results of the smoke tests.\n\n## 9. Reporting\n\nThe test report will include the following information:\n\n*   Date and time of test execution.\n*   Test environment details (browser, OS).\n*   Summary of test results (pass/fail for each test case).\n*   Detailed information on any failures, including error messages and screenshots.\n\n## 10. Exit Criteria\n\nThe smoke tests are considered successful if all test cases pass. If any test cases fail, the issue should be investigated and resolved before proceeding with further testing."
