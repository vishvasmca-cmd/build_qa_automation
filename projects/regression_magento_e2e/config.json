  "master_plan": "Okay, here is a Master Test Strategy document for Magento's e-commerce platform, focusing on regression testing and your specified user goal. This document is designed to guide the engineering team (Senior QAs, Test Architects, SDETs) in building a robust and reliable test automation framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Platform\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: E-commerce platforms are highly critical. A failure directly impacts revenue, customer satisfaction, and brand reputation. Specifically, core functions like search, product selection, adding to cart, and checkout are P0 (highest priority) areas.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**:\n    *   **Financial Loss**: Failure in checkout or payment processing directly leads to lost revenue.\n    *   **Data Breach**: Security vulnerabilities could expose sensitive customer data (PII, payment information), leading to legal and reputational damage.\n    *   **Loss of Trust**: Frequent errors or a poor user experience erodes customer trust and loyalty.\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Search functionality (keyword-based search).\n        *   Product detail page (size, color selection).\n        *   Add to Cart functionality.\n        *   Shopping Cart functionality (quantity, updates).\n        *   Checkout process (address, shipping, payment).\n        *   User account management (login/logout for regression).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness (simulated).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Performance testing (separate strategy).\n        *   Detailed database testing (beyond data integrity checks).\n        *   CMS functionality (admin panel, product creation).\n        *   3rd party integrations (unless directly impacting core flows).\n        *   Accessibility testing (initial phase, expand later).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**: A minimal set of tests executed on every build to ensure core functionality is operational.\n    *   Navigate to the homepage.\n    *   Verify the search bar is present.\n    *   Search for a valid product (e.g., \"Radiant Tee\").\n    *   Verify search results are displayed.\n    *   Navigate to the checkout page.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**: A comprehensive suite executed periodically (nightly/weekly) or upon significant code changes.  Focus on the 'Radiant Tee' scenario.\n    *   **Positive Testing (Happy Path)**:\n        *   Search for \"Radiant Tee\".\n        *   Select size 'S'.\n        *   Select color 'Blue'.\n        *   Add to cart.\n        *   Verify the item is in the cart with correct size and color.\n        *   Proceed to checkout.\n        *   Enter valid shipping information.\n        *   Select a valid shipping method.\n        *   Enter valid payment information (using test data).\n        *   Place the order.\n        *   Verify order confirmation page.\n    *   **Negative Testing**:\n        *   **Search**:\n            *   Search for non-existent product.\n            *   Search with special characters/SQL injection attempts.\n        *   **Product Selection**:\n            *   Attempt to add to cart without selecting size/color.\n            *   Select invalid size/color combinations (if applicable).\n        *   **Add to Cart**:\n            *   Add the same item multiple times (check quantity updates).\n        *   **Checkout**:\n            *   Invalid shipping address format.\n            *   Invalid payment information (e.g., incorrect credit card number).\n            *   Attempt to proceed without required fields.\n            *   Test with expired credit cards.\n            *   Verify error messages for invalid input.\n        *   **Edge Cases**:\n            *   Simultaneous add-to-cart actions from multiple users (concurrency).\n            *   Simulate network errors during checkout (e.g., timeout during payment processing).\n            *   Test with empty cart.\n            *   Test with extremely large quantities.\n    *   **Security**:\n        *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on all input fields (search, address, payment).  Focus on preventing SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n        *   Input validation on all forms.\n        *   Ensure sensitive data (credit card numbers) is properly masked/encrypted.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data Generation**: Prefer dynamic generation of test data (e.g., using Faker libraries) for names, addresses, and unique identifiers.\n    *   **Static Test Data**: Use static, pre-defined test data for payment information (credit card numbers specifically designed for testing). *Never* use real credit card data.\n    *   **Data Reset**: Implement a mechanism to clean up or reset test data after each test run to ensure consistent results.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**: Implement a Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   Create separate Page Objects for each page/section of the application (e.g., HomePage, SearchResultsPage, ProductDetailPage, ShoppingCartPage, CheckoutPage).\n    *   Each Page Object should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n    *   Use a common base class for all Page Objects to handle driver management, logging, and reporting.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content updates. This avoids brittle tests that fail due to timing issues.\n    *   **Self-Healing**: Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to handle common element location changes. For example, try multiple locators (ID, Name, XPath) or use relative locators.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for flaky tests related to network issues or external services.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Favor explicit waits over implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Centralized Configuration**: Externalize configuration parameters (e.g., timeouts, URLs, browser settings) to a central configuration file for easy modification and management.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**: Focus autonomous testing/exploration on these areas *first*:\n    *   Homepage Search.\n    *   Product Detail Page (Radiant Tee).\n    *   Shopping Cart Page.\n    *   Checkout Page.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **General**:\n        *   HTTP Status Code: Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n        *   Page Title: Verify that the page title is correct and relevant.\n        *   Error Messages: Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input or unexpected errors.\n        *   Logging: Ensure that all test actions are properly logged for debugging and analysis.\n    *   **Specific to 'Radiant Tee' Scenario**:\n        *   Product Display: Verify the \"Radiant Tee\" product is displayed in the search results.\n        *   Size/Color Selection: Verify that the selected size ('S') and color ('Blue') are correctly displayed on the product detail page and in the cart.\n        *   Cart Contents: Verify that the cart contains the correct item with the correct quantity, size, and color.\n        *   Checkout Success: Verify that the order is placed successfully and the order confirmation page is displayed. Check the confirmation page for order number and summary.\n        *   Database Verification: If possible (with proper access and security), verify that the order is correctly recorded in the database.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust test automation framework for the Magento e-commerce platform. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as needed based on your specific project requirements and feedback from the team. Good luck!"
