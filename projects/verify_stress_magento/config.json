  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-Commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Magento e-commerce application at `https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/`. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, encompassing risk assessment, testing strategy, architectural guidance, and execution instructions. This strategy is designed to ensure a robust and reliable user experience, particularly focusing on the identified user goal and regression testing needs.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: The application operates within the E-commerce domain, where critical functionalities include product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, and payments. Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n*   **Risk Profile**: Potential risks include:\n    *   **Financial Loss**: Failed transactions, incorrect pricing, or shipping errors.\n    *   **Data Breach**: Security vulnerabilities leading to customer data compromise.\n    *   **Reputational Damage**: Poor user experience due to bugs, slow performance, or security incidents.\n    *   **Compliance Issues**: Failure to meet regulatory requirements for data privacy or security.\n\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   All functionalities related to the user goal outlined: Searching, product browsing, adding to cart, shopping cart editing, checkout, payments, and order placement.\n        *   Core e-commerce flows: product browsing, search, filtering, shopping cart, checkout, payment processing, order management.\n        *   Authentication: User login and registration (including guest checkout).\n        *   Performance testing: Load times of critical pages (product details, cart, checkout).\n        *   Security testing: Basic OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Third-party integrations (except for payment gateway interaction).\n        *   Detailed performance testing (beyond load times).\n        *   Comprehensive security penetration testing.\n        *   Admin panel functionalities.\n        *   Accessibility testing (unless specifically mandated).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis testing strategy emphasizes a robust regression suite, given the identified user goal and the potential impact of changes on existing functionality.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   Purpose: To verify core system health and basic functionality after each build.\n    *   Test Cases:\n        *   Verify the homepage loads successfully.\n        *   Verify that a user can search for a product (e.g., \"Jacket\") and results are displayed.\n        *   Verify that a user can add a product to the cart.\n        *   Verify that a user can proceed to the checkout page.\n    *   Execution Frequency: After each build deployment to any environment.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**:\n    *   Purpose: To ensure that new code changes haven't introduced defects or broken existing functionality.\n    *   Test Cases (Based on user goal AND domain knowledge):\n        *   **Positive Testing**:\n            *   Execute the user goal precisely as described (Search 'Jacket'. Click 'Olivia 1/4 Zip'. Size 'M', Color 'Purple'. Add to Cart. Click 'Sale'. Click 'Tees'. Click 'Desiree Fitness Tee'. Size 'L', Color 'Black'. Add to Cart. Edit Cart. Update 'Desiree' qty to 2. Update Cart. Checkout as guest 'test@example.com', 'Test' 'User', '123 St', 'New York', 'NY', '10001', '1234567890'. Shipping 'Table Rate'. Payment. Place Order).\n            *   Browse product catalog by category and subcategory.\n            *   Add multiple items with different quantities to the cart.\n            *   Apply a valid coupon code during checkout.\n            *   Successfully complete order placement with different shipping addresses.\n        *   **Negative Testing**:\n            *   Search for a non-existent product.\n            *   Attempt to add an out-of-stock item to the cart.\n            *   Enter invalid data during checkout (e.g., incorrect email format, invalid zip code).\n            *   Attempt to use an expired or invalid coupon code.\n            *   Simulate payment failure (e.g., insufficient funds, declined card).\n            *   Attempt to submit the checkout form with missing required fields.\n        *   **Edge Cases**:\n            *   Add a large quantity of items to the cart (near the system's limit).\n            *   Simultaneous access to the same product by multiple users.\n            *   Network interruptions during checkout.\n            *   Browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n        *   **Security Testing**:\n            *   Basic input validation to prevent XSS attacks.\n            *   SQL injection prevention (sanitize search queries and input fields).\n            *   Verify secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., credit card information).\n\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   A hybrid approach is recommended:\n        *   **Static Data**: Use static test data for core product catalog and user accounts (e.g., a predefined \"test user\" account).\n        *   **Dynamic Data Generation**: Generate dynamic data for order details (e.g., email addresses, shipping addresses) to avoid conflicts and ensure unique test runs. Use libraries like Faker.js or similar.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: This pattern will improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Create page objects for key application pages (e.g., HomePage, ProductDetailPage, ShoppingCartPage, CheckoutPage). Each page object encapsulates the elements and actions specific to that page.\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.  (e.g., Wait for an element to be visible before clicking).\n    *   **Self-Healing**: Implement basic self-healing mechanisms.  For example, if an element is not found, try refreshing the page or navigating back to the previous page and retrying.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests (e.g., network issues, temporary server errors).\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    *   Prioritize exploration of the following pages and flows, based on the user goal and risk assessment:\n        *   Homepage (`/`)\n        *   Search Results Page (`catalogsearch/result/?q=Jacket`)\n        *   Product Detail Page (`/olivia-1-4-zip-light-jacket.html`)\n        *   Shopping Cart Page (`/checkout/cart/`)\n        *   Checkout Page (`/checkout/`)\n        *   Order Confirmation Page (`/checkout/onepage/success/`)\n        *   Sale Page (`/sale.html`)\n        *   Tees Page (`/sale/tees-sale.html`)\n        *   Product Detail Page (`/desiree-fitness-tee.html`)\n    *   Focus on exploring variations in product attributes (size, color) and checkout options (shipping methods, payment methods).\n\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Success**:\n        *   HTTP Status Codes: Expect HTTP 200 (OK) for all page requests.\n        *   Page Content Verification: Verify the presence of expected elements and text on each page.\n            *   Search Results: Confirm relevant products are displayed.\n            *   Product Detail Page: Verify product name, price, attributes, and availability.\n            *   Shopping Cart: Verify the correct items, quantities, and prices are displayed.\n            *   Checkout Page: Verify the correct shipping and billing information is pre-populated (if applicable) and that payment options are available.\n            *   Order Confirmation: Verify the order number and confirmation message are displayed.\n        *   Database Verification: (Optional, but recommended) Validate that the order is correctly created in the database.\n    *   **Failure**:\n        *   HTTP Status Codes: Any status code other than 200 (e.g., 404, 500) indicates a failure.\n        *   Missing Elements: Missing or incorrect elements on a page.\n        *   Error Messages: Unexpected error messages displayed to the user.\n        *   Incorrect Data: Incorrect product prices, quantities, or order details.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be continuously reviewed and updated based on the application's evolution and changing business needs."
