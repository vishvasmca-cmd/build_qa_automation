  "master_plan": "## Master Test Plan: Nike.com - Smoke Test Suite\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** Senior QA Strategist\n\n### 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for the smoke test suite of Nike.com. This plan defines the scope, objectives, and approach for verifying the critical functionalities of the website, ensuring a stable and functional user experience. This plan will guide the autonomous agents on which elements to prioritize.\n\n### 2. Project Overview\n\n*   **Target URL:** `https://www.nike.com`\n*   **Business Domain:** Ecommerce\n*   **Testing Type:** Smoke Testing\n*   **User Goal:** Navigate to Nike homepage, verify the hero headline contains 'Just Do It', find and click the 'Shop' button.\n\n### 3. Domain Analysis\n\nNike.com is a global e-commerce platform for athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories. The primary goals of the website are to:\n\n*   Showcase Nike's products and brand.\n*   Facilitate online purchases.\n*   Provide information about Nike's technologies and initiatives.\n*   Engage with customers and build brand loyalty.\n\nThe website is likely built on a complex architecture including various front-end technologies (React, Angular or similar) and back-end systems (databases, APIs, order management systems). The site handles sensitive user data (payment information, personal details) making security and data privacy paramount. The site also needs to serve different GEO locations with different languages.\n\n### 4. Scope\n\nThis smoke test suite will focus on verifying the following critical functionalities:\n\n*   Website availability and basic performance.\n*   Core navigation and menu functionality.\n*   Core end-to-end flow (navigation, key element verification, action).\n\n### 5. Smoke Test Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke test suite will consist of the following test cases:\n\n**Test Case 1: Website Availability and Basic Performance**\n\n*   **Description:** Verifies that the Nike.com website is accessible and loads within an acceptable timeframe.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.nike.com`.\n    2.  Verify that the page loads successfully (HTTP status code 200).\n    3.  Verify that the page load time is within an acceptable threshold (e.g., < 5 seconds).\n*   **Expected Result:** The website should load successfully and within the specified timeframe.\n\n**Test Case 2: Core Navigation - Menu Links Functionality**\n\n*   **Description:** Verifies that the main menu links are functional and navigate to the correct pages.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.nike.com`.\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu (e.g., using an `aria-label=\"main-menu\"` or similar).\n    3.  Iterate through each visible link in the menu.\n    4.  Click on each link.\n    5.  Verify that the page navigates to a different URL.\n*   **Expected Result:** All main menu links should navigate to the correct pages.\n\n**Test Case 3: Core Flow - Homepage Validation and Shop Button Click**\n\n*   **Description:** Verifies a basic user flow: validating the hero headline and clicking the \"Shop\" button.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.nike.com`.\n    2.  Locate the main hero headline (e.g., using an `<h1>` tag or an `aria-label` attribute).\n    3.  Verify that the hero headline contains the text \"Just Do It\" (case-insensitive).\n    4.  Locate the \"Shop\" button (e.g., using text content \"Shop\" or an appropriate `aria-label`).\n    5.  Click the \"Shop\" button.\n    6.  Verify that the page navigates to a different URL.\n*   **Expected Result:** The hero headline should contain \"Just Do It\", the \"Shop\" button should be clickable, and clicking it should navigate to a new page.\n\n### 6. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize the following elements and pages:\n\n*   **Homepage (`/`)**:\n    *   Main hero section (headline, image, call to action button).  Specifically, look for headline text.\n    *   Main navigation menu: Identify the elements and attributes used for navigation links.\n    *   Page load time.\n*   **Navigation Menu**:\n    *   Focus on elements with `aria-label` attributes like \"main-menu\" or similar semantic HTML elements like `<nav>`.\n    *   Identify patterns in the URL structure after clicking on different menu items.\n*   **\"Shop\" Button**:\n    *   Explore different locators for the \"Shop\" button, including text content, `aria-label`, and CSS selectors. Be prepared that it could be an `<a>` or a `<button>` tag.\n\n### 7. Test Environment\n\nThe smoke tests should be executed in a stable and representative environment. This could be:\n\n*   Latest version of Chrome.\n*   Latest version of Firefox.\n*   Screen resolution: 1920x1080.\n*   Operating System: Windows or macOS.\n\n### 8. Reporting\n\nThe autonomous agent should generate a clear and concise report indicating:\n\n*   Test case execution status (pass/fail).\n*   Error messages (if any).\n*   Screenshots (if failures occur).\n*   Page load times.\n\n### 9. Success Criteria\n\nThe smoke test suite is considered successful if all test cases pass. If any test case fails, the build should be considered unstable and further investigation is required.\n\n### 10. Maintenance\n\nThis Master Test Plan should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the Nike.com website and business requirements."
