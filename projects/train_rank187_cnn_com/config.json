  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: CNN.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a smoke test of CNN.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** CNN.com is a high-traffic news website. Availability and accessibility are critical to maintain user trust and deliver timely information.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure to load or access core functionalities can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of User Trust:** Users may switch to alternative news sources.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative publicity due to website outages.\n    *   **Loss of Ad Revenue:** Reduced traffic impacts advertising revenue.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars) on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n        *   Testing specific news articles or content.\n        *   Performance testing (load times, etc.).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Mobile device testing (initially).\n        *   Accessibility testing (initially).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the CNN.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Button Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons (e.g., Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, Search, Menu).\n        3.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links (e.g., \"Terms of Service\", \"Privacy Policy\").\n        4.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars (e.g., Top Navigation, Footer Navigation).\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for a smoke test.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the CNN.com homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class with methods to identify buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential delays in element loading. This will reduce flakiness due to timing issues. For example, poll for the presence of a button for up to 5 seconds before failing the test.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **CNN.com Homepage (https://cnn.com):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP status code 200 (OK).\n        *   Page title contains \"CNN\".\n    *   **Button Identification:**\n        *   At least 5 buttons are present on the page.\n        *   Buttons are visible (displayed on the page).\n    *   **Link Identification:**\n        *   At least 2 links are present on the page.\n        *   Links are visible (displayed on the page).\n    *   **Menu Bar Identification:**\n        *   At least 2 menu bars are present on the page.\n        *   Menu bars are visible (displayed on the page).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing a smoke test of CNN.com. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the website's core functionalities are validated quickly and efficiently."
