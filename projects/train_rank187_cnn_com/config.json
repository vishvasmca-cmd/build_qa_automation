  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: CNN.com Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the CNN.com smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the test architecture, execution, and reporting.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** CNN.com is a high-traffic news website. Availability and accessibility are critical. Failure to load or access key features can lead to a loss of readership and damage to brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Website unavailability, inability to access critical news content.\n    *   **Medium:** Broken links, non-functional buttons, incorrect page rendering.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Identification of Login/Signup/GetStarted (or similar) buttons.\n        *   Identification of 5 buttons and 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking on any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Mobile testing (initially).\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Testing of sub-pages beyond the homepage.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the core functionality of CNN.com is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the CNN.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Button Identification:** Verify the presence of at least five distinct buttons on the homepage.\n        3.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least two distinct links on the homepage.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least two distinct menu bars on the homepage.\n        5.  **Login/Signup Button Identification:** Verify the presence of a Login, Signup, GetStarted, or similar button/link on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for a smoke test.* A regression suite will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element identification, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the CNN.com homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the CNN.com homepage (e.g., `getLoginButton()`, `getButtons()`, `getLinks()`, `getMenuBars()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to be present and visible before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions and log informative messages.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **CNN.com Homepage (https://cnn.com):** This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the CNN logo or a recognizable title element.\n    2.  **Button Identification:** At least five elements with the HTML tag `<button>` or similar interactive elements are present on the page.\n    3.  **Link Identification:** At least two elements with the HTML tag `<a>` (anchor tag) are present on the page.\n    4.  **Menu Bar Identification:** At least two distinct navigation bars or menu structures are present on the page, identifiable by `<div>` or `<nav>` tags with appropriate class names (e.g., \"menu\", \"navigation\").\n    5.  **Login/Signup Button Identification:** An element containing text such as \"Login\", \"Sign Up\", \"Get Started\", \"Register\", or similar is present on the page.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate a clear and concise test report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots of the homepage to visually confirm the presence of the identified elements.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for the CNN.com smoke test. It ensures that the core functionality of the website is verified quickly and efficiently. This document will be reviewed and updated as needed."
