  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: CNN.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a smoke test of CNN.com. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** CNN.com is a high-traffic news website. Availability and accessibility are critical. Failure can lead to loss of readership, reputational damage, and potential misinformation dissemination.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** The primary risks associated with failure are:\n    *   **Loss of Revenue:** Inability to serve ads due to website downtime.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative perception due to website unavailability or critical functionality failure.\n    *   **Data Integrity:** While less critical for a news site, ensuring data displayed is accurate is still important.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Existence and accessibility of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Basic HTTP status code verification.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Functionality of buttons and links (no clicks).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Responsiveness testing (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Negative testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is up and running, and critical UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the CNN.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Button Existence:** Verify a \"Login\" button/link is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Existence:** Verify a \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link is present on the page.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Existence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" button/link is present on the page (if applicable).\n        5.  **Button Existence (Generic #1):** Verify another button/link is present on the page.\n        6.  **Button Existence (Generic #2):** Verify another button/link is present on the page.\n        7.  **Link Existence (Generic #1):** Verify a link is present on the page.\n        8.  **Link Existence (Generic #2):** Verify a link is present on the page.\n        9.  **Menu Bar Existence (Generic #1):** Verify a menu bar is present on the page.\n        10. **Menu Bar Existence (Generic #2):** Verify a menu bar is present on the page.\n    *   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All test cases must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** *Not applicable for a smoke test. This will be defined in a separate Regression Test Strategy document.*\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on UI element existence.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the CNN.com homepage and its elements. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the CNN.com homepage (e.g., `loginButton`, `signupButton`, `isLoginButtonPresent()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading. This will reduce flakiness.  Example:  Wait up to 5 seconds for the Login button to be present before failing the test.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests (e.g., retry a test up to 2 times before marking it as a failure). This can help mitigate intermittent issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage:** `https://cnn.com`\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify the HTTP status code is 200 (OK) for the homepage.\n    *   **Element Existence:** Verify the presence of the specified buttons, links, and menu bars using appropriate locators (e.g., XPath, CSS selectors).\n    *   **Text Verification (Optional):** If possible, verify the text of the buttons/links is as expected (e.g., \"Login\", \"Sign Up\").  This adds an extra layer of confidence.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate a clear and concise test report indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots for failed test cases to aid in debugging.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for the CNN.com smoke test. It will be reviewed and updated as needed to ensure its continued effectiveness."
