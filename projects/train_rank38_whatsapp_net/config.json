  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: WhatsApp.net - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the WhatsApp.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** WhatsApp.net is a communication platform. While this smoke test focuses on the website itself (not the core messaging functionality), failures can impact user acquisition, brand perception, and initial user experience.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure to load the website or find key elements (Login, Signup, etc.) results in immediate user frustration, potential loss of new users, and damage to brand reputation. This is considered a **high-risk** scenario for initial access.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and load time.\n        *   Presence and visibility of specified UI elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Basic rendering of the website layout.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of any buttons or links (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation (e.g., color accuracy, font sizes).\n        *   Performance testing beyond initial load time.\n        *   Testing on specific browsers or devices (will be addressed in regression).\n        *   Error handling or negative scenarios.\n        *   API testing.\n        *   Database validation.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):** This suite will verify the core functionality of the website's landing page.\n\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the website loads successfully within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n        2.  **Login Element:** Verify the \"Login\" element is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" element (or equivalent) is present and visible.\n        4.  **Button Count:** Verify at least 5 buttons are present and visible on the page.\n        5.  **Link Count:** Verify at least 2 links are present and visible on the page.\n        6.  **Menu Bar Count:** Verify at least 2 menu bars are present and visible on the page.\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on UI element presence, not data input or manipulation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** A lightweight framework using a simple Page Object Model (POM) structure is recommended. This allows for easy maintenance and readability. Example:\n    *   `HomePage.java` (or equivalent language) - Contains locators and methods for interacting with the WhatsApp.net homepage.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with reasonable timeouts to handle potential delays in element loading. This prevents false failures due to timing issues. Example: Wait up to 5 seconds for the \"Login\" button to be visible.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for website load failures. A temporary network issue should not automatically fail the entire smoke test.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:** The autonomous agent should focus on the following:\n\n    1.  **WhatsApp.net Homepage:** This is the primary target.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP 200 status code AND page title contains \"WhatsApp\" (or similar branding).\n    *   **Element Presence:** Element is visible on the page (e.g., `element.isDisplayed()` in Selenium).\n    *   **Element Text:** Verify the text of the \"Login\" and \"Signup/Get Started\" elements (or equivalent) matches expected values.\n    *   **Count Verification:** Verify the number of buttons, links, and menu bars meets the defined criteria.\n*   **Success Criteria:** All test cases in the smoke suite must pass for the build to be considered stable."
