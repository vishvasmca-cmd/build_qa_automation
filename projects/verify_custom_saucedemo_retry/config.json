  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. Here's the Master Test Strategy document for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing for the core e-commerce flow.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com - Regression Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n**User Goal:** Login, Add Item to Cart, Checkout\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo.com is a demonstration e-commerce website. While not a real production system, the principles applied here are directly transferable. The core business criticality lies in the ability of users to:\n\n*   **Login Successfully:** Access their accounts.\n*   **Browse Products:** View available items.\n*   **Add Items to Cart:** Select items for purchase.\n*   **Checkout Successfully:** Complete the purchase process.\n\nFailure in any of these areas directly impacts the user's ability to complete a purchase, leading to a negative user experience.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nGiven the e-commerce nature, potential failures can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process payments, incorrect order totals.\n*   **Data Breach:** Security vulnerabilities exposing user data (credentials, addresses, payment information).  *Note: While Saucedemo is a demo site, we will still treat security as a priority.*\n*   **Trust Loss:** Negative user experience leading to abandonment of the site.\n\n**Risk Prioritization:**\n\n*   **P0 (Critical):** Login failures, checkout failures, payment processing errors, security vulnerabilities.\n*   **P1 (High):** Add to cart failures, product display errors, incorrect order calculations.\n*   **P2 (Medium):** Minor UI issues, non-critical error messages.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Login Functionality:** Valid and invalid credentials, account lockout.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Display of products, filtering, sorting.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and updating items.\n*   **Checkout Process:** Entering shipping and billing information, payment processing (simulated), order confirmation.\n*   **User Interface:** Responsiveness across different browsers and devices.\n*   **Security:** Basic OWASP Top 10 checks (input validation, XSS, SQLi).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing, etc.\n*   **Advanced Security Testing:** Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning.\n*   **Integration with External Systems:** (Since it's a demo site, there are no real external integrations)\n*   **A/B Testing:** Experimentation with different UI elements.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Login:**\n    *   Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n*   **Product Listing:**\n    *   Verify that the product listing page loads successfully.\n*   **Add to Cart:**\n    *   Verify that an item can be added to the cart.\n*   **Checkout:**\n    *   Verify that the checkout page can be reached.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Login:**\n    *   Valid login credentials.\n    *   Invalid login credentials (incorrect username, password).\n    *   Account lockout after multiple failed attempts.\n    *   Password reset functionality (if available).\n*   **Product Catalog:**\n    *   Display of products with correct information (name, price, description).\n    *   Filtering and sorting of products.\n    *   Product details page.\n*   **Shopping Cart:**\n    *   Adding items to the cart.\n    *   Removing items from the cart.\n    *   Updating item quantities.\n    *   Verifying cart total.\n    *   Handling empty cart scenarios.\n*   **Checkout Process:**\n    *   Entering valid shipping and billing information.\n    *   Simulating payment processing (successful and failed).\n    *   Verifying order confirmation page.\n    *   Handling invalid input during checkout (e.g., incorrect address format).\n*   **User Interface:**\n    *   Responsiveness across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n    *   Responsiveness across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n    *   Verification of UI elements (buttons, links, text fields).\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid input in all forms (e.g., special characters, excessively long strings).\n    *   Boundary value testing (e.g., minimum and maximum quantities).\n    *   Simulating network failures during checkout.\n    *   Handling timeouts.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency testing (multiple users accessing the same product).\n    *   Handling large numbers of items in the cart.\n    *   Testing with different browser settings (e.g., cookies disabled).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input validation to prevent XSS attacks.\n    *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n    *   Checking for sensitive data exposure in error messages.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined usernames, passwords, product names, and addresses.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generated data for scenarios requiring unique values (e.g., email addresses, order numbers).  Faker libraries will be used for this.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a centralized location (e.g., CSV files, database) for easy access and maintenance.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  The Page Object Model design pattern is highly recommended. This will improve code maintainability and reusability. Each page of the application will be represented by a Page Object, which encapsulates the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met. This will help to mitigate timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific elements to be in a specific state (e.g., visible, clickable).\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors (e.g., retrying failed actions, refreshing the page).\n*   **Error Handling:**\n    *   Implement robust error handling to catch and log exceptions.\n    *   Provide informative error messages to help diagnose issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages/flows first:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://www.saucedemo.com/`\n2.  **Inventory Page:** (After successful login) - Focus on product display and filtering.\n3.  **Product Details Page:** (Click on any product) - Verify product information.\n4.  **Cart Page:** (After adding items to the cart) - Verify cart contents and total.\n5.  **Checkout: Your Information:** (First step of checkout) - Verify form fields.\n6.  **Checkout: Overview:** (Second step of checkout) - Verify order summary.\n7.  **Checkout: Complete:** (Final step of checkout) - Verify order confirmation.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all pages.\n    *   Expected text and elements are visible on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product names on the inventory page).\n    *   No JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n    *   Data is displayed correctly (e.g., correct product prices, accurate cart totals).\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Missing or incorrect data.\n    *   JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing Saucedemo.com. It will be reviewed and updated as needed to ensure that it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the application.\n"
