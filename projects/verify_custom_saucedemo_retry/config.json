While not a live production system, simulating real-world e-commerce scenarios is crucial for testing. Key business functionalities include:\n\n*   **Login/Authentication:** Secure user access.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying and filtering products.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and managing items.\n*   **Checkout Process:** Entering shipping information, payment details, and order confirmation.\n\n**Prioritization:**\n\n*   **P0 (Critical):** Login, Add to Cart, Checkout Flow (including payment simulation). Failure in these areas directly impacts the ability to complete a purchase.\n*   **P1 (High):** Product Catalog, User Profile Management. Issues here degrade the user experience and potentially lead to lost sales.\n*   **P2 (Medium):** Minor UI elements, non-critical error messages.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the SauceDemo application, while not directly impacting real-world revenue, can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Confidence:** If the demo fails, users may lose confidence in the underlying testing framework or automation strategy.\n*   **Misleading Results:** Inaccurate test results can lead to incorrect conclusions about the stability and performance of the system under test (if SauceDemo is being used to simulate a real application).\n*   **Reputational Damage:** If used for training or demonstrations, failures can negatively impact the perception of the team or organization.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Functional Testing:** All core e-commerce functionalities (Login, Product Browsing, Add to Cart, Checkout).\n*   **Regression Testing:** Ensuring existing functionality remains intact after code changes.\n*   **Negative Testing:** Validating error handling and input validation.\n*   **Security Testing (Basic):** Input sanitization to prevent basic XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Testing on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   **Performance Testing (Basic):** Page load times for critical flows.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Load Testing:** Simulating a large number of concurrent users.\n*   **Penetration Testing:** In-depth security vulnerability assessment.\n*   **Accessibility Testing (WCAG Compliance):** While important, not a primary focus for this initial strategy.\n*   **Mobile Testing:** Focused on desktop browser testing initially.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the application's basic health.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n    *   Verify successful navigation to the product catalog page.\n    *   Verify that at least one product can be added to the cart.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid Login Attempts: Incorrect username/password combinations.\n    *   Invalid Input Fields: Special characters, exceeding character limits in address fields.\n    *   Empty Cart Checkout: Attempting to checkout with an empty cart.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n    *   Network Failures: Simulating network interruptions during checkout.\n    *   Empty States: Handling empty product lists, empty search results.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input Sanitization: Testing for basic XSS vulnerabilities in input fields (e.g., product search, address fields).\n    *   SQL Injection: Testing input fields for SQL injection vulnerabilities (e.g., username, password).\n*   **Cross-Module Interactions:**\n    *   Cart Updates: Verify that changes in the cart (add/remove items) are reflected in the header cart summary.\n    *   Inventory Management: Verify that adding an item to the cart reduces the available inventory (if applicable).\n*   **Validation Messages:**\n    *   Required Fields: Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed when required fields are left blank.\n    *   Invalid Input Formats: Verify that error messages are displayed for invalid email addresses, phone numbers, etc.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** Use a set of predefined user credentials and product information for basic functional tests.\n*   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Employ libraries like Faker.js or similar to generate realistic, randomized data for negative testing and edge cases.\n*   **Data Management:** Store test data in a centralized location (e.g., JSON files, database) for easy access and maintenance.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to encapsulate page elements and interactions. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and reduces test duplication.\n    *   Create separate page object classes for each page (e.g., LoginPage, ProductPage, CartPage, CheckoutPage).\n    *   Each page object should contain locators for elements on the page and methods for interacting with those elements.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitUntil` or `waitFor`) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically retry failed actions or re-locate elements if they are not found.  Consider using relative locators or AI-powered element identification tools.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are present and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  Focus on different login scenarios (valid credentials, invalid credentials, locked out user).\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:** Explore different product categories, sorting options, and filtering options.\n3.  **Product Detail Page:**  Focus on adding products to the cart.\n4.  **Shopping Cart Page:** Explore modifying quantities, removing items, and proceeding to checkout.\n5.  **Checkout Page:** Focus on entering shipping information, payment details, and completing the order.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected text or elements are visible on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product name on the product detail page).\n    *   Successful navigation between pages.\n    *   Correct data is displayed (e.g., cart total, order confirmation details).\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected error messages.\n    *   Incorrect data or missing elements.\n    *   Application crashes or freezes.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the SauceDemo e-commerce application. It will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the project.\n```"
