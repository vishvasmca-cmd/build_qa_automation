  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy for SauceDemo, focusing on regression testing for the login, add item to cart, and checkout flows. This document will serve as a blueprint for the engineering team and stakeholders.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: SauceDemo Regression Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** SauceDemo is a demonstration e-commerce application. While not a real production system, testing it rigorously allows us to showcase robust testing methodologies and frameworks. The critical flows are login, adding items to the cart, and the checkout process.\n*   **Risk Profile:**  While failure in SauceDemo doesn't directly lead to financial loss, the risk lies in demonstrating poor testing practices. A broken flow or a poorly designed test suite reflects negatively on the engineering team's capabilities.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Full regression testing of the login functionality.\n        *   Comprehensive testing of adding items to the cart, including quantity updates and removal.\n        *   End-to-end testing of the checkout process, covering various scenarios (shipping information, payment, order confirmation).\n        *   Negative testing for all input fields (invalid characters, boundary values, etc.).\n        *   Basic security checks (input sanitization).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n        *   Advanced security penetration testing.\n        *   Database-level testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance - unless specifically requested).\n        *   API testing (if not directly related to the UI flows being tested).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):** (To be executed before Regression)\n\n    *   Verify successful login with a valid user.\n    *   Verify that the inventory page loads successfully after login.\n    *   Add one item to the cart.\n    *   Navigate to the cart page.\n    *   Proceed to the first step of checkout.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n\n    *   **Login Functionality:**\n        *   Valid login credentials (standard user, locked out user, problem user, performance glitch user, error user)\n        *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect username, incorrect password, both incorrect).\n        *   Account lockout scenarios (multiple failed login attempts).\n        *   Password recovery (if implemented).\n        *   \"Remember Me\" functionality (if implemented).\n    *   **Add to Cart Functionality:**\n        *   Adding multiple items to the cart.\n        *   Adding the same item multiple times.\n        *   Removing items from the cart.\n        *   Updating item quantities in the cart.\n        *   Validating cart total calculation.\n        *   Handling out-of-stock scenarios (if applicable).\n    *   **Checkout Process:**\n        *   Successful checkout with valid shipping and payment information.\n        *   Checkout with missing shipping information.\n        *   Checkout with invalid shipping information (e.g., incorrect zip code).\n        *   Checkout with invalid payment information (e.g., incorrect credit card number).\n        *   Cancellation of the checkout process at various stages.\n        *   Verification of order confirmation page.\n        *   Verification of order details (items, quantities, total).\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Input fields:  Invalid characters, special characters, SQL injection attempts (basic), XSS attempts (basic), exceeding maximum length, empty fields.\n        *   Boundary values:  Testing with minimum and maximum allowed values (e.g., quantity).\n        *   Timeouts:  Simulating network delays and verifying appropriate error handling.\n        *   Empty States:  Handling scenarios with empty carts, no items in the inventory, etc.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency:  Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n        *   Network failures:  Simulating network disruptions during the checkout process.\n        *   Browser compatibility issues.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic input sanitization checks to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. (e.g., try `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in name fields).\n        *   Verification that sensitive data (passwords, credit card information) is transmitted securely (HTTPS).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Test Data:**  A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:**  Predefined user accounts with different roles (e.g., standard user, locked-out user).  Predefined product data (names, descriptions, prices).\n        *   **Dynamic Data:**  Generated data for shipping addresses, payment information (using valid patterns, not real data!), and order numbers.  Faker libraries (e.g., `Faker` in Python or JavaScript) are recommended for generating realistic-looking data.\n    *   **Data Management:** Test data should be managed in a centralized location (e.g., configuration files, databases) to ensure consistency and maintainability.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** **Page Object Model (POM)**\n\n    *   Each page of the application should be represented as a separate class (Page Object).\n    *   Page Objects should encapsulate the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n    *   Test cases should interact with the application through Page Objects, not directly with the web elements.\n    *   This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to be present or interactable before interacting with them. Avoid implicit waits, as they can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n    *   **Polling Assertions:**  Instead of directly asserting on the state of an element, use polling assertions to repeatedly check the element's state until it meets the expected condition. This helps to mitigate flakiness due to timing issues. (e.g., retry assertion a few times if it fails)\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors. For example, if an element is not found, try refreshing the page or navigating back to the previous page. Consider using relative locators to find elements based on nearby known elements in case of minor UI changes.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests. This can help to mitigate flakiness due to temporary network issues or other transient errors.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Prioritized):**\n\n    1.  **Login Page:** Thorough exploration of the login page, including all input fields, error messages, and account lockout scenarios.\n    2.  **Inventory Page:**  Verify the display of products, sorting options, and navigation to individual product pages.\n    3.  **Cart Page:**  Explore adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.\n    4.  **Checkout Information Page:** Inputting shipping information, validating input fields, and proceeding to the next step.\n    5.  **Checkout Overview Page:**  Reviewing order details, verifying the total amount, and completing the order.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:**  Ensure that all requests return the expected HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK for successful requests, 302 Redirect for redirects, 400 Bad Request for invalid requests, 500 Internal Server Error for server errors).\n    *   **Element Presence:**  Verify that expected elements are present on the page (e.g., login button, product names, cart total).\n    *   **Text Verification:**  Verify that the correct text is displayed on the page (e.g., welcome message, product descriptions, error messages).\n    *   **Data Validation:** Verify that the data entered by the user is correctly processed and displayed (e.g., shipping address, payment information, order details).\n    *   **Redirection:** Validate redirections happen when they should.\n    *   **UI Elements:** Verify UI elements are displayed and working as designed (buttons, dropdowns, etc).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for regression testing the SauceDemo application. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the quality and reliability of the application."
