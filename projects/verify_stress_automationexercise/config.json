  "master_plan": "## Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com E-commerce Platform\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for AutomationExercise.com, an e-commerce platform. It provides a clear roadmap for our testing efforts, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimizing risks associated with software releases. This strategy emphasizes risk-based testing and a robust architecture to maintain a stable and reliable user experience.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: AutomationExercise.com falls under the e-commerce domain, where the ability to browse, purchase, and manage accounts directly impacts revenue and user satisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile**: Failures in this system could result in:\n    *   **Financial Loss**: Loss of revenue due to checkout failures, incorrect pricing, or payment processing issues.\n    *   **Reputational Damage**: Negative user experiences leading to loss of customer trust and brand erosion.\n    *   **Data Breach**: Security vulnerabilities that expose sensitive user data (e.g., payment information, personal details).\n    *   **Operational Disruption**: Inability to process orders, manage inventory, or provide customer support.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   All functionalities explicitly mentioned in the provided User Goal.\n        *   Core e-commerce features: product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, payment processing, user account management, search functionality.\n        *   Key integrations: payment gateways, shipping providers, email services.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n        *   Responsive design testing (desktop and mobile).\n        *   Security Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 basics)\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Performance testing (initially, can be added later).\n        *   Advanced security testing (Penetration testing, advanced vulnerability scans) - initially.\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - can be phased in.\n        *   Localization testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy utilizes both Smoke and Regression testing to ensure quality at every stage.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**: This suite provides a rapid health check to ensure the application's core functionality is operational.  It will be executed after each build.\n    *   **Components**:\n        *   **Login**: Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   **Product Catalog**: Verify product catalog loads and product details are visible.\n        *   **Add to Cart**: Successfully add a product to the shopping cart.\n        *   **Checkout**: Initiate the checkout process.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**: A comprehensive suite designed to ensure existing functionality remains intact after code changes. Focuses on the User Goal scenario and expands on it.\n    *   **Negative Testing**:\n        *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect password, locked account).\n        *   Checkout with invalid address/payment details.\n        *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart.\n        *   Using invalid coupon codes.\n    *   **Edge Cases**:\n        *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding/removing items from the same cart simultaneously.\n        *   Network failures: Simulate network interruptions during checkout/payment.\n        *   Empty states: Handling empty cart, search results, or product listings.\n    *   **Security**:\n        *   Input validation: Prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks by validating all user inputs (search queries, form fields).\n        *   Password security: Ensure passwords are encrypted and stored securely.\n    *   **Data Strategy**:\n        *   **Dynamic Test Data Generation**: Use a combination of static data (for core flows) and dynamic data generation (using Faker libraries) to ensure test data is unique and avoids conflicts.\n        *   **Data Storage**: Test data will be managed using properties files and data providers within the test framework.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**: Page Object Model (POM). This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability by representing each web page as a separate class.\n    *   Each page will have its own class, containing:\n        *   Web element locators (e.g., buttons, text fields, labels).\n        *   Methods that perform actions on the page (e.g., `login()`, `addProductToCart()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions (Wait Strategies)**: Use explicit waits and polling assertions to handle asynchronous behavior and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them. This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues. Example: wait up to 10 seconds for the \"Welcome\" message to appear after login.\n    *   **Self-Healing**: Implement a self-healing mechanism that can automatically identify and recover from broken locators. This can involve using multiple locators for the same element and dynamically switching to a working locator when one fails.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially those that are prone to flakiness due to network issues or external dependencies. Retry failed tests up to 2 times before marking them as a failure.\n    *   **Centralized Configuration**: Externalize configuration parameters (e.g., base URL, browser type, timeouts) into a configuration file. This allows for easy modification and avoids hardcoding values in the test scripts.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Ordered by Priority)**:\n    1.  **Homepage**: Verify basic elements load.\n    2.  **Products Page**: Verify products are displayed, search functionality works, and product details can be accessed.\n    3.  **Product Detail Page**: Verify product information, add to cart functionality.\n    4.  **Shopping Cart**: Verify items are added correctly, quantity can be updated, and items can be removed.\n    5.  **Signup/Login Page**: Verify signup/login forms are displayed, error messages are shown for invalid inputs.\n    6.  **Account Creation**: Verify account creation process, including form validation and successful account creation.\n    7.  **Checkout Process**: Verify address selection, payment processing, order confirmation.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Successful Page Load**: HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Visibility**: Key elements (e.g., product names, prices, buttons) are visible and interactable.\n    *   **Data Integrity**: Correct product details are displayed, cart totals are accurate, order confirmations are generated successfully.\n    *   **Text Verification**: Specific text elements are present (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, \"Order Placed Successfully!\" message after checkout).\n    *   **Error Handling**: Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or unexpected situations.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated periodically to adapt to changing requirements and evolving risks. Regular communication and collaboration between the testing team and other stakeholders are crucial for the success of this strategy."
