  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. My mandate is to create a comprehensive Master Test Strategy for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing and the specific user goal of logging in with the credentials \"standard_user\" and \"secret_sauce\". Here's the plan:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://www.saucedemo.com/\n**Business Domain:** General E-commerce (Simulated)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo.com, while a demo application, simulates a typical e-commerce platform.  Key functionalities include:\n\n*   **Login:** User authentication and access control.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying and filtering products.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and managing items.\n*   **Checkout:**  Entering shipping information, payment details, and order confirmation.\n\nGiven the simulated e-commerce nature, the **Checkout process is considered P0** (highest priority) followed by Login (P1).\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of Saucedemo.com, even though a demo, can lead to:\n\n*   **Loss of Trust:**  Unreliable demo experience reflects poorly on the underlying technology.\n*   **Data Integrity Issues:**  Incorrect product information or order details.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Exposure of user credentials or sensitive data (simulated).\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to Login, Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, and Checkout.\n*   Positive and negative test scenarios for all user input fields.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions).\n*   Basic security checks (input validation).\n*   Accessibility testing (basic checks for ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).\n*   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n*   Detailed accessibility compliance (WCAG conformance).\n*   Mobile testing (unless specifically requested).\n*   API testing (unless directly exposed and critical to UI functionality).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify the application loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    *   Verify the Login page is accessible.\n    *   Verify a user can log in with valid credentials (\"standard_user\" / \"secret_sauce\") and is redirected to the product catalog page.\n    *   Verify at least one product is displayed on the product catalog page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Login Functionality:**\n    *   **Positive:**\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials (\"standard_user\" / \"secret_sauce\").\n        *   Successful login with other valid users (if available).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Invalid username.\n        *   Invalid password.\n        *   Empty username and password fields.\n        *   Locked out user (if applicable).\n        *   SQL Injection attempts in username and password fields.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Remember me functionality (if available).\n        *   Password reset functionality (if available).\n\n*   **Product Catalog:**\n    *   **Positive:**\n        *   Verify product images are displayed.\n        *   Verify product names and descriptions are accurate.\n        *   Verify product prices are displayed correctly.\n        *   Verify products can be filtered by category (if applicable).\n        *   Verify products can be sorted by price, name, etc. (if applicable).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Verify error handling when product images are missing.\n        *   Verify error handling when product descriptions are too long.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Verify handling of products with special characters in their names or descriptions.\n\n*   **Shopping Cart:**\n    *   **Positive:**\n        *   Verify products can be added to the cart.\n        *   Verify the cart displays the correct number of items.\n        *   Verify the cart displays the correct total price.\n        *   Verify products can be removed from the cart.\n        *   Verify the cart can be emptied.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Verify error handling when adding a product to the cart that is out of stock.\n        *   Verify error handling when adding a quantity of a product that exceeds the available stock.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Verify handling of discounts and coupons.\n        *   Verify handling of shipping costs.\n\n*   **Checkout:**\n    *   **Positive:**\n        *   Verify the checkout process can be completed successfully with valid shipping and payment information.\n        *   Verify order confirmation is displayed after checkout.\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Verify error handling for invalid shipping information (e.g., missing address, invalid zip code).\n        *   Verify error handling for invalid payment information (e.g., invalid credit card number, expired credit card).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Verify handling of different payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal).\n        *   Verify handling of different shipping options (e.g., standard, express).\n\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic input validation to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.\n    *   Verify sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers) is not stored in plain text.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamic test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:**  The \"standard_user\" / \"secret_sauce\" credentials will be used for basic login tests.  Other user accounts (if available) will also be used.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:**  Randomly generated data will be used for fields such as shipping addresses and credit card numbers (using appropriate masking and validation techniques).  Consider using Faker libraries for data generation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Language:**  [Choose a suitable language - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript] based on team expertise.\n*   **Testing Framework:** [Choose a suitable framework - e.g., Selenium WebDriver with JUnit/TestNG (Java), pytest (Python), Cypress/Playwright (JavaScript)].\n*   **Reporting:**  Integrate with a reporting tool to generate clear and concise test reports (e.g., Allure, Extent Reports).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met, rather than relying on hardcoded timeouts.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors, such as stale element references.  This could involve retrying actions or refreshing the page.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for flaky tests.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent (if applicable) should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:**  https://www.saucedemo.com/\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:** (Accessed after successful login)\n3.  **Individual Product Pages:** (Accessed from the Product Catalog)\n4.  **Shopping Cart Page:** (Accessed by clicking the cart icon)\n5.  **Checkout Pages:** (Accessed from the Shopping Cart)\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant text and elements are visible on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product names and prices on the product catalog page).\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n    *   All test cases pass without errors.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Missing or incorrect text or elements.\n    *   JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n    *   Test cases fail due to unexpected behavior.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing Saucedemo.com. It will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the application and the evolving testing landscape.\n```\n"
