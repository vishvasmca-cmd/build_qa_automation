  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Smoke Testing for vedcdnlb.com\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the vedcdnlb.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** vedcdnlb.com is a general web application. The specific business purpose is unknown, but the presence of Login, Signup/GetStarted, and Try for Free buttons suggests a service-oriented platform.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionalities (website launch, navigation, user onboarding) can lead to immediate user attrition, damage to brand reputation, and potential loss of business opportunities.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, 2 additional buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the identified buttons and links (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX testing (e.g., responsiveness, visual appearance).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Mobile device testing (initially).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and the core UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully in a default browser.\n        2.  **UI Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the following elements on the homepage:\n            *   Login button\n            *   Signup/GetStarted button (or equivalent)\n            *   Try for Free button (or equivalent)\n            *   2 additional buttons (any buttons present on the page)\n            *   2 links (any links present on the page)\n            *   2 menu bars (any menu bars present on the page)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on UI element presence.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `HomePage` class with methods to identify the required UI elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential loading delays. For example, wait for a UI element to be present on the page before asserting its existence.\n    *   **Example (Conceptual):** `waitForElementPresent(loginButtonLocator, timeout=5)`\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Homepage (/)**: This is the primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code AND page title is present (even if generic).\n    *   **UI Element Identification:**\n        *   Each specified UI element (Login, Signup, Try for Free, 2 Buttons, 2 Links, 2 Menu Bars) MUST be present on the page.\n        *   Verification should be done using appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath).\n        *   Example: `assertElementPresent(loginButtonLocator)`\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed test cases, including screenshots (if possible).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and actionable plan for smoke testing the vedcdnlb.com website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance."
