  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Regression Test Strategy: Master Plan\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for ParaBank (https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm), a banking application. This strategy focuses on ensuring the stability and reliability of core functionalities through comprehensive regression testing.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\n*   **Business Domain:** Banking\n*   **Criticality:** High. As a banking application, data integrity, transaction accuracy, and security are paramount. Errors can lead to financial loss, regulatory penalties, and severe reputational damage.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect transactions, data breaches, or system outages can directly result in financial losses for the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to customer data can lead to identity theft and significant legal ramifications.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust due to application failures can have long-term consequences on the bank's brand and customer base.\n*   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with banking regulations (e.g., data privacy, transaction security) can result in substantial fines and legal action.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   User Registration (including validation of unique user details)\n    *   Account Creation (specifically Checking accounts)\n    *   Funds Transfer (between existing and newly created accounts)\n    *   Bill Payment\n    *   User Login and Logout\n    *   Security checks related to data input and session management\n    *   Error handling and exception scenarios within the above functionalities\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   UI/UX (focus is on functionality, not aesthetics)\n    *   Performance testing (handled separately)\n    *   Database testing (directly, will be covered indirectly by API/UI testing)\n    *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning - handled separately)\n    *   Browser Compatibility testing (will be limited to a primary browser initially, expanded later)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity - Build Verification Test)\n\n*   **Purpose:** Verify basic application health after deployment or code changes.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Navigate to the ParaBank homepage (verify HTTP 200 and page title).\n    2.  Attempt to Login with valid credentials for an existing, hard-coded user (verify successful login and redirection to account summary page).\n    3.  Logout (verify successful logout and redirection to the homepage).\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThis suite will cover the core functionalities specified in the User Goal: \"Full Regression: Register a new user with unique details, Open a new Checking Account, Transfer from the new account to the old one, Pay a Bill of to 'Electric Company', and finally Logout.\"\n\n1.  **User Registration:**\n    *   **Positive:** Register a new user with valid, unique credentials (verify successful registration and redirection to account creation page).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Attempt registration with existing username (verify error message).\n        *   Attempt registration with invalid email format (verify error message).\n        *   Attempt registration with empty fields (verify error messages for required fields).\n        *   Attempt registration with excessively long or special characters in fields (verify input validation).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Registration with username containing special characters.\n        *   Registration under high load (multiple concurrent registrations).\n2.  **Account Creation (Checking Account):**\n    *   **Positive:** Open a new checking account from an existing account (verify successful account creation and balance updates).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Attempt to open a new account without selecting an existing account (verify error message).\n        *   Attempt to open an account with an invalid account ID (verify error message).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Opening multiple accounts in rapid succession.\n3.  **Funds Transfer:**\n    *   **Positive:** Transfer funds between accounts (verify successful transfer and accurate balance updates).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Transferring more funds than available (verify insufficient funds error).\n        *   Transferring to a non-existent account (verify error message).\n        *   Transferring zero or negative amounts (verify error message).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrent transfers from the same account.\n        *   Transferring very large amounts.\n4.  **Bill Payment:**\n    *   **Positive:** Pay a bill to \"Electric Company\" (verify successful payment and balance updates).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Attempt to pay a bill with insufficient funds (verify insufficient funds error).\n        *   Attempt to pay a bill to an invalid payee account number (verify error message).\n        *   Attempt to pay a zero or negative amount (verify error message).\n        *   Attempt to pay with missing payee information (verify error messages).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Pay a bill with special characters in payee name.\n        *   Pay a bill with extremely high amount.\n5.  **Logout:**\n    *   **Positive:** Logout from the application (verify successful logout and redirection to homepage).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Logging out during an active transaction (verify proper session invalidation).\n6.  **Security:**\n    *   **SQL Injection:** Attempt to inject SQL code into input fields (username, password, payee name, etc.). Verify that the application properly sanitizes inputs and prevents SQL injection attacks.\n    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attempt to inject JavaScript code into input fields. Verify that the application properly encodes outputs and prevents XSS attacks.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Dynamic Generation:** The preferred approach is to dynamically generate test data (usernames, account numbers, payment amounts) to avoid conflicts and ensure uniqueness.\n*   **Data Management:** A utility should be created to generate unique usernames (e.g., using timestamps or UUIDs).\n*   **Database Reset (Optional):**  If feasible, consider resetting the database to a known state before each test suite execution to ensure consistency.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Highly recommended. This pattern promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n    *   Each page of the ParaBank application should have its corresponding Page Object class.\n    *   Page Objects should encapsulate the elements and actions specific to that page.\n    *   Test cases should interact with the application through Page Objects.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy (Handling Flakiness)\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Instead of immediate assertions, use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met. This helps handle timing issues and asynchronous operations.  Specify explicit timeouts.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to control the waiting time for specific elements.\n*   **Self-Healing (Basic):** Implement mechanisms to locate elements dynamically. Use robust locators (e.g., IDs, data attributes) over fragile locators (e.g., XPaths based on position).  Have strategies to re-locate an element if the original locator fails.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Order of Exploration)\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages/flows in this order to maximize coverage of core functionalities:\n\n1.  **Homepage (Registration):** Focus on identifying and interacting with all registration form elements.\n2.  **Open New Account:**  Focus on the form elements and account selection.\n3.  **Transfer Funds:** Focus on \"From Account\" and \"To Account\" dropdowns, amount, and the transfer button.\n4.  **Pay Bills:** Focus on all fields, including payee name, address, account number, and amount.\n5.  **Account Details Page:** Focus on different transactions and available actions\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return HTTP 200 (OK).\n*   **Element Visibility:** Verify that key elements (labels, buttons, form fields) are visible on each page.\n*   **Text Verification:**\n    *   \"Welcome\" message after successful login.\n    *   Success messages after successful registration, account creation, fund transfer, and bill payment.\n    *   Error messages for negative test cases (e.g., \"Username already exists\", \"Insufficient funds\").\n*   **Balance Updates:** Verify that account balances are updated correctly after fund transfers and bill payments.\n*   **Database Integrity:** Verify that the database is updated with the expected values."
