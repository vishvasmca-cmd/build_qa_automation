  "master_plan": "## Master Test Plan: Roche.com - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior QA Strategist\n\n### 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for the Roche.com website, focusing on smoke testing. This plan will guide the autonomous agents in effectively mining, verifying, and structuring the initial test suite.\n\n### 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\n*   **URL:** `https://www.roche.com`\n*   **Business Domain:** Healthcare (Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, and related services)\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Roche is a multinational healthcare company focused on pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. The website serves as a primary communication channel for investors, patients, healthcare professionals, and potential employees. Key functionalities likely include:\n    *   Information about products and services.\n    *   Investor relations information.\n    *   Career opportunities.\n    *   News and media releases.\n    *   Patient support resources.\n*   **Overall Goal of Website:** To provide comprehensive information about Roche's activities, products, and services to a diverse audience, and to promote the company's brand and reputation as a leader in healthcare innovation.\n\n### 3. Testing Scope\n\nThis Master Test Plan focuses on the **Smoke Test Suite**. The primary objective is to ensure the critical functionalities of the website are operational and accessible. This is a high-level test suite designed to catch major issues quickly after deployment or code changes.\n\n### 4. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe Smoke Test Suite will consist of the following test cases:\n\n#### 4.1 Website Availability\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Description:** Verify that the Roche.com website is accessible and returns a successful HTTP status code (200).\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.roche.com`\n    2.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200.\n*   **Expected Result:** The website should load successfully with a 200 HTTP status code.\n\n#### 4.2 Core Navigation\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Description:** Verify the core navigation menu links are functional.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.roche.com`\n    2.  Locate the main navigation menu.  This will likely be in the header.\n    3.  Iterate through each primary link in the navigation (e.g., \"About Us\", \"Products\", \"Careers\", \"Investors\").\n    4.  Click each link.\n    5.  Verify that the page loads successfully and the URL changes as expected.\n*   **Expected Result:** Each navigation link should lead to a corresponding page without errors.\n\n#### 4.3 Core Flow: Headline and Learn More\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Description:** Verify the presence of the hero headline and its text, and then click on 'Learn More'\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to `https://www.roche.com`\n    2.  Locate the main hero section of the page.\n    3.  Verify that the hero headline is present.\n    4.  Verify that the hero headline text contains 'Doing now what patients need next'.\n    5.  Locate the 'Learn More' button/link within the hero section.\n    6.  Click the 'Learn More' button/link.\n    7.  Verify that the page loads successfully and redirects to a relevant page.\n*   **Expected Result:** The hero headline should be displayed with the correct text. Clicking the 'Learn More' button should navigate to a page with more information.\n\n### 5. Strategic Mining Instructions\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize mining the following elements and pages for subsequent testing:\n\n1.  **Navigation Menu:**  Identify all links in the main header navigation. Mine the `href` attributes for each link.\n2.  **Footer Links:** Identify all links in the footer. Mine the `href` attributes for each link.\n3.  **Hero Section:** Focus on extracting:\n    *   The exact text content of the hero headline.\n    *   The `href` attribute of the \"Learn More\" button/link.\n4.  **Page Structure:** Analyze the structure of the homepage and linked pages to identify common elements (e.g., search bars, contact forms, news feeds).\n5.  **Accessibility Attributes:** When mining elements, pay attention to accessibility attributes such as `alt` text for images and `aria-label` for interactive elements. This will be useful for future accessibility testing.\n\n**Mining Priority:** Homepage > Primary Navigation Links > Footer Links\n\n**Data Storage:** Store the mined data in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV) for easy access and future test case generation.  Include the element type, its attributes (e.g., `href`, `text`), and its location on the page.\n\n### 6. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS (latest version)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n### 7. Test Execution\n\nThe autonomous agent should execute the Smoke Test Suite automatically upon code deployment or on a scheduled basis (e.g., nightly).\n\n### 8. Reporting\n\nThe autonomous agent should generate a clear and concise test report that includes:\n\n*   Test Case ID and Description\n*   Test Result (Pass/Fail)\n*   Execution Time\n*   Error Messages (if any)\n*   Screenshots (for failed test cases)\n\n### 9. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the test suite to include more comprehensive functional testing.\n*   Incorporate accessibility testing to ensure the website is usable by people with disabilities.\n*   Implement performance testing to identify and address any performance bottlenecks.\n*   Add localization testing to ensure proper display of website content in different languages.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for the autonomous agent to begin testing the Roche.com website. By following these guidelines, the agent can effectively identify and report critical issues, ensuring the quality and stability of the website."
