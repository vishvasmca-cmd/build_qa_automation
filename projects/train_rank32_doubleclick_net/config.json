  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: DoubleClick.net - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the DoubleClick.net website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** DoubleClick.net is an advertising technology platform. While not directly customer-facing in the same way as an e-commerce site, its reliability is crucial for advertisers and publishers. Failure can lead to lost revenue, inaccurate reporting, and damage to reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A failure in core functionality (website availability, login, navigation) can have significant financial and reputational consequences for Google (DoubleClick's parent company). Data breaches are a high-severity risk.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic rendering.\n        *   Identification of key UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, links, and menu bars).\n        *   Verification of the presence of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the identified buttons, links, and menu bars (no clicking).\n        *   Detailed testing of advertising serving, reporting, or other platform features.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic HTTPS verification).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Element Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Element Presence:** Verify a \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or similar call-to-action button/link is present.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element Presence:** Verify a \"Try for Free\" or similar call-to-action button/link is present.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Generic x5):** Verify the presence of five distinct buttons on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Presence (Generic x2):** Verify the presence of two distinct links on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Presence (Generic x2):** Verify the presence of two distinct menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deferred):**  A full regression suite will be developed later, focusing on the functionality of the identified elements and the core advertising platform features.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For this smoke test, no specific test data is required. The focus is on UI element presence, not functionality.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent the website's pages and UI elements. This will improve test maintainability and readability.  Each page (e.g., Homepage) will have its own Page Object containing locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when waiting for elements to load.  This will reduce flakiness.  Example:  Wait up to 5 seconds for the \"Login\" button to be present.\n    *   **Locator Strategy:**  Prioritize robust locators (e.g., IDs, ARIA attributes) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (/)**:  The primary focus for identifying the target UI elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Availability:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified UI elements (Login, Signup, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present in the DOM (Document Object Model).  Verify this by checking if the element is found using the defined locators.\n    *   **No Interaction:**  The tests should *not* click or interact with any of the identified elements.  The goal is simply to verify their presence."
