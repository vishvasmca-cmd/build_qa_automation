  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Rahul Shetty Academy E-commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Rahul Shetty Academy e-commerce application (Target URL: `https://rahulshettyacademy.com/client`). It serves as the blueprint for all testing activities and provides guidance for the engineering team.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe application falls under the **E-commerce** domain, which inherently involves handling sensitive user data and financial transactions. Core functionalities include product browsing, user management, shopping cart, and order processing. Any failure in these areas can directly impact revenue, customer trust, and data security. The Checkout & Payments module is of paramount importance (P0).\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nPotential risks associated with application failure include:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect order processing, payment failures, and inaccurate pricing can lead to significant financial losses.\n*   **Data Breach:** Security vulnerabilities could expose sensitive user data (e.g., personal information, payment details), leading to legal repercussions and reputational damage.\n*   **Loss of Trust:** Frequent errors, unreliable performance, and security incidents can erode customer trust and negatively impact brand reputation.\n*   **Operational Disruption:** Critical system failures can disrupt business operations, impacting order fulfillment and customer service.\n*   **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Failure to comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) can result in fines and legal penalties.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities explicitly mentioned in the User Goal:\n    *   User Registration\n    *   User Login/Logout\n    *   Product Catalog Browsing & Filtering\n    *   Shopping Cart Management\n    *   Checkout Process (Address Selection, Country Selection)\n    *   Order Placement\n    *   Order History & Details\n    *   Payment Processing (Simulated)\n*   Core E-commerce flows, including product browsing, adding to cart, and checkout.\n*   Security aspects, including user authentication and data protection.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest stable versions).\n*   Responsive design testing (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).\n\n**Out of Scope (Initially):**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance) - to be addressed in a separate phase.\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - to be addressed in a separate phase.\n*   Detailed API testing (focus on UI for initial regression).\n*   Integration with external services (except payment gateway simulation).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite provides a rapid health check to ensure the core system is functional after deployments or major code changes.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify User Login with valid credentials.\n    *   Verify that the Product Catalog page loads successfully.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After every build deployment to any environment (Dev, Staging, Production).\n*   **Failure Criteria:** If any smoke test fails, the build is considered unstable and should be rejected.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite provides comprehensive testing to ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions and that existing functionality remains intact.\n\n*   **Test Cases:** (Based on User Goal and Domain Playbook)\n\n    *   **Authentication:**\n        *   Login with Invalid Password\n        *   Login with Locked Account (if applicable)\n        *   Password Reset Flow (if applicable)\n        *   Registration with Existing Email\n    *   **Product Catalog:**\n        *   Filter products by Price/Category (if available)\n        *   Sort products (Price Low-High) (if available)\n        *   Search for non-existent product\n    *   **Shopping Cart:**\n        *   Update Quantity in Cart (valid and invalid quantities)\n        *   Remove Item from Cart\n        *   Add Out-of-Stock Item (Verify Error)\n        *   Cart Persistence (Refresh Page)\n    *   **Checkout & Payments:**\n        *   Checkout with differently formatted Address\n        *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code (if applicable)\n        *   Payment Decline Simulation\n        *   Verify correct Tax/Shipping calculation\n        *   Country Selection and Impact on Shipping/Tax\n    *   **Order Management:**\n        *   Verify Order Confirmation after successful checkout.\n        *   View Order History\n        *   View Order Details (verify order summary, items, shipping address, etc.)\n        *   Sign Out Functionality\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n\n    *   Invalid inputs in registration/login forms (e.g., special characters, empty fields).\n    *   Invalid address formats during checkout.\n    *   Attempting to apply expired or invalid coupon codes.\n    *   Entering excessively large quantities in the shopping cart.\n    *   Attempting to place an order with insufficient stock.\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n    *   Network Failures: Simulate network disruptions during checkout.\n    *   Empty States: Handle scenarios with empty shopping carts, no search results, etc.\n    *   Boundary analysis around quantity, prices and discounts.\n\n*   **Security Testing (OWASP Top 10 Basics):**\n\n    *   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Attempt to inject SQL code into input fields (search bar, login form, address fields).\n    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attempt to inject JavaScript code into input fields (product reviews, comments).\n    *   **Broken Authentication:** Verify password complexity requirements and account lockout policies.\n    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., payment details) is properly encrypted and protected.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** At a minimum, before every major release and after any significant code changes. Ideally, after every sprint.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined user accounts (for different roles), product catalog data, and valid coupon codes.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generate user names, email addresses, and addresses to avoid conflicts and ensure uniqueness. The 'faker' library is recommended.\n*   **Data Management:** Maintain a clear separation between test data and production data. Use appropriate data masking techniques for sensitive information.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nAdopt the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and reduces code duplication.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   **Page Objects:** Represent individual web pages with their elements and actions.\n    *   **Test Cases:** Implement specific test scenarios using the Page Objects.\n    *   **Utilities:** Helper functions for common tasks (e.g., data generation, API calls).\n    *   **Configuration:** Store environment-specific settings (e.g., URLs, credentials).\n\n*   **Technology Stack:**\n    *   **Programming Language:** Java or Python (based on team expertise).\n    *   **Test Automation Framework:** Selenium WebDriver or Cypress\n    *   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ or equivalent.\n    *   **Reporting:** Allure or similar reporting tool for detailed test results.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met, instead of relying on fixed timeouts.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically locate elements even if their locators change slightly (e.g., using relative locators or AI-powered element identification).\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement retry logic for flaky tests (e.g., network-related issues), with a limited number of retries.\n*   **Reporting:** Clearly identify flaky tests in the test reports and track their frequency.  Investigate and fix the root cause of flaky tests instead of relying solely on retries.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Priority Flows)\n\nThe Autonomous Agent (assuming the organization is using one for test case generation) should explore these pages/flows *first* to maximize test coverage:\n\n1.  **User Registration:** Cover all input fields and validation scenarios.\n2.  **User Login:** Validate login with valid and invalid credentials.\n3.  **Product Listing Page:** Explore filtering, sorting, and pagination.\n4.  **Product Detail Page:** Verify product information, add to cart functionality.\n5.  **Shopping Cart Page:** Verify item quantities, remove items, and calculate total.\n6.  **Checkout Page:** Address selection, shipping options, payment methods, and order summary.\n7.  **Order Confirmation Page:** Verify order details and confirmation message.\n8.  **Order History Page:** View order history and order details.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Execution:** All tests pass without errors or unexpected failures.\n*   **Correct Data:** Data displayed in the application matches the expected values (e.g., order totals, product prices).\n*   **Expected Behavior:** The application behaves as expected according to the user stories and requirements.\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all API requests return the correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error).\n*   **UI Elements:** UI elements are displayed correctly and are interactable.\n*   **Log Analysis:** Review application logs for any errors or warnings.\n\n**Success is defined as the application behaving as expected and all critical functionalities working smoothly.** Specifically, the user should be able to complete the core ecommerce flow of registering, logging in, finding a product, adding to cart, checking out and viewing their order.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the Rahul Shetty Academy e-commerce application. Adherence to this strategy will help ensure the delivery of a high-quality, reliable, and secure product. This document will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changing requirements and evolving technologies."
