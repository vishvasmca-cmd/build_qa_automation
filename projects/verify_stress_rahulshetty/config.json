  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: E-Commerce Application\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Rahul Shetty Academy e-commerce application, focusing on regression testing to ensure high quality and stability. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, including Senior QAs, Test Architects, and SDETs, guiding the automation and execution of tests.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The application falls under the E-commerce domain. Critical functionalities include authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, and order management.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the system can lead to significant financial loss (due to failed transactions, incorrect calculations), data breaches (customer data, payment information), and loss of customer trust, potentially impacting brand reputation and future sales. Checkout process is definitely P0\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All functionalities listed in the \"User Goal\" (Registration, Login, Product Filtering, Cart Operations, Checkout, Order Placement, Order Viewing, Sign Out).\n        *   Related modules: Product Catalog, Payment Processing, User Profile.\n        *   Positive and Negative test scenarios for the above-mentioned modules.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n        *   Basic security checks (input validation, basic authentication).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress).\n        *   Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance, although basic accessibility checks are recommended).\n        *   Mobile application testing (if separate).\n        *   Integration with third-party services beyond payment gateways (e.g., CRM, marketing automation).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Definition:** A minimal set of tests executed on every build to verify the core functionality is operational.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify application is loading.\n    *   User Login (with valid credentials).\n    *   Basic product browsing (verify product catalog loads).\n\n### Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Focus:** Comprehensive suite to ensure existing functionality remains intact after changes.  Covers all aspects of the user goal, plus variations, edge cases, and security checks.\n\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid registration data (e.g., missing required fields, invalid email format, weak password).\n        *   Login with incorrect credentials (invalid username, invalid password, locked account).\n        *   Checkout with invalid address, invalid credit card details, expired coupon codes.\n        *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Checkout with extremely large quantities of items.\n        *   Concurrent user access to the cart and checkout process.\n        *   Handling network errors during checkout (e.g., payment gateway timeout).\n        *   Testing with special characters in product names, addresses, etc.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks (e.g., sanitize user inputs in registration, login, search).\n        *   Verify password storage is secure (hashed and salted).\n        *   Check for basic authentication vulnerabilities (e.g., session fixation).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data Generation:** Employ a strategy to dynamically generate test data (e.g., using Faker libraries) for registration and checkout processes.  This ensures uniqueness and avoids conflicts.\n    *   **Static Test Data:** Use a pre-defined set of data for login and product catalog testing.  Maintain this data and update it as needed.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Adopt the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.\n    *   Create Page Objects for each significant page/component (e.g., LoginPage, ProductCatalogPage, ShoppingCartPage, CheckoutPage, OrderConfirmationPage).\n    *   Each Page Object encapsulates the elements and actions specific to that page.\n    *   Test cases interact with the application through these Page Objects, improving maintainability and reducing code duplication.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use explicit waits (polling assertions) to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading.  This avoids brittle tests that fail due to timing issues.  Example:  `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.text_to_be_present_in_element((By.ID, \"element_id\"), \"expected_text\"))`\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to handle element locators that may change over time.  Consider using relative locators or AI-powered self-healing tools.  Also, implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests.\n    *   **Centralized Configuration:** Store configuration settings (e.g., base URL, browser settings, database credentials) in a central configuration file. This allows for easy modification and environment-specific configurations.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Prioritized Exploration):**\n    1.  **Registration Flow:** Focus on the registration page, verifying all input fields and error messages.\n    2.  **Login Flow:** Cover both valid and invalid login attempts, password reset functionality.\n    3.  **Product Catalog:**  Explore product filtering, sorting, and search functionality.\n    4.  **Shopping Cart:** Test adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.\n    5.  **Checkout Process:** This is the highest priority area. Explore different payment methods, shipping options, address formats, and coupon codes.\n    6.  **Order Management:** Verify order history and order details page.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all requests return the expected HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK for successful requests, 400/404 for errors).\n    *   **Text Visibility:** Confirm that expected text elements are present on the page (e.g., \"Welcome, [username]\", \"Order Confirmation\", \"Your order has been placed successfully\").\n    *   **Data Integrity:**  Verify that data is correctly displayed and stored in the database (e.g., product prices, order totals, customer information).\n    *   **UI Element States:**  Check the state of UI elements (e.g., buttons are enabled/disabled as expected, error messages are displayed correctly).\n    *   **Functional Correctness:** Verify that the application performs the correct actions (e.g., adding items to the cart updates the cart total, placing an order creates a new order in the system).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will serve as a guiding document for the QA team and will be updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle."
