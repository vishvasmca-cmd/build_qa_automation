  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Registrar-Servers.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the Registrar-Servers.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Registrar-Servers.com appears to be a domain registration and related services provider. The core business revolves around users being able to access the website, find key actions (login, signup, etc.), and navigate the main menu.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure to access the website or find key actions results in immediate loss of potential customers and damage to brand reputation. This is a high-risk scenario.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website accessibility (HTTP 200 OK).\n        *   Presence and visibility of Login functionality.\n        *   Presence and visibility of Signup/Get Started/Try for Free (or similar) functionality (at least 5 buttons).\n        *   Presence and visibility of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Presence and visibility of at least 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of Login, Signup, or any other buttons/links (no clicks).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Error handling.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Accessibility:** Navigate to `https://registrar-servers.com` and verify HTTP status code 200.\n        2.  **Login Presence:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button or link on the homepage.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons related to signup, getting started, or trying the service for free (e.g., \"Sign Up,\" \"Get Started,\" \"Try for Free,\" \"Create Account,\" \"Register Now\").\n        4.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        5.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing. This strategy focuses solely on the initial health check.\n*   **Data Strategy:** No specific test data is required for smoke testing, as we are only verifying the presence of elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** While a full Page Object Model (POM) might be overkill for this minimal smoke test, consider a simplified structure with:\n    *   A `BasePage` class containing common methods for navigating to the website and verifying HTTP status.\n    *   A `HomePage` class representing the Registrar-Servers.com homepage, with methods to verify the presence of key elements (Login, Signup buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to allow elements to load before asserting their presence. This helps avoid false failures due to slow loading times.  Example: Wait up to 5 seconds for the Login button to be present.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire smoke test suite. If the suite fails, retry it once or twice before marking the build as failed. This can help mitigate transient network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  `https://registrar-servers.com` (Homepage)\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Accessibility:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    2.  **Login Presence:** The \"Login\" button/link is present and visible on the page.\n    3.  **Signup/Get Started Presence:** At least 5 buttons related to signup/getting started are present and visible on the page.\n    4.  **Link Presence:** At least 2 links are present and visible on the page.\n    5.  **Menu Bar Presence:** At least 2 menu bars are present and visible on the page.\n*   **Reporting:**  A clear pass/fail report should be generated after each execution of the smoke test suite.  Failures should be investigated immediately.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing Registrar-Servers.com. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality of the website is consistently verified, minimizing the risk of critical failures."
