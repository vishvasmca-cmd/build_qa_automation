  "master_plan": "# GoDaddy.com - Master Test Strategy (Smoke Testing)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for Smoke Testing the GoDaddy.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** GoDaddy.com is a critical web application providing domain registration, website hosting, and related services. Failure can result in lost revenue, damaged reputation, and customer dissatisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. System failures directly impact revenue generation and customer trust. Data breaches or service outages can have significant financial and legal consequences.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons, 2 other buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Verification of element presence and basic accessibility (no broken links).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of each button/link/menu item.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Error handling.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the GoDaddy.com website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Navigate to `https://godaddy.com`. Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **Login Button Presence:** Verify the \"Login\" button is present and visible on the page.\n        3.  **Signup/GetStarted Button Presence:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Button Presence:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button Presence (Additional 1):** Identify and verify the presence of another prominent button (e.g., \"Contact Us\").\n        6.  **Button Presence (Additional 2):** Identify and verify the presence of another prominent button (e.g., \"Shop Now\").\n        7.  **Link Presence (1):** Identify and verify the presence of a prominent link (e.g., \"Support\").\n        8.  **Link Presence (2):** Identify and verify the presence of another prominent link (e.g., \"About Us\").\n        9.  **Menu Bar Presence (1):** Verify the presence of the main navigation menu bar.\n        10. **Menu Bar Presence (2):** Verify the presence of a secondary menu bar (e.g., footer menu).\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* This document focuses solely on the initial smoke test strategy.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability and scalability in future testing phases. Create page objects for the main GoDaddy.com page, encapsulating element locators and interactions.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for element to be visible) to handle potential timing issues during page load.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed assertions due to transient network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  `https://godaddy.com` (Homepage)\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    *   **Element Presence:** Elements (buttons, links, menu bars) are present in the DOM and visible on the page. Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify elements.\n    *   **No Broken Links:** Verify that the identified links do not return a 404 or other error status code.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Detailed test execution reports should be generated, including pass/fail status for each test case and any error messages encountered.\n    *   Failures should be investigated and resolved promptly.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the GoDaddy.com website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the quality and stability of the application."
