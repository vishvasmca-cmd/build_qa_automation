  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Product Search\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for regression testing the product search functionality on AutomationExercise.com. It provides guidance for the engineering team to ensure a robust and reliable testing approach.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### Domain Analysis\nAutomationExercise.com appears to be an e-commerce platform, likely focused on fashion or related products.  A functional product search is critical for user experience and sales. Failure to provide accurate and reliable search results directly impacts revenue and user satisfaction.\n\n### Risk Profile\n- **Financial Loss**: Inaccurate or non-functional search leads to lost sales opportunities.\n- **Reputation Damage**:  Poor search results frustrate users and damage the brand's reputation.\n- **Data Integrity**:  Although less likely, search functionality vulnerabilities could potentially expose product data.\n\n### Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n- Product search functionality on the Products page.\n- Search input validation (e.g., handling special characters, long strings).\n- Search results accuracy (matching keywords, relevant products).\n- Pagination and sorting of search results.\n- Display of product information in search results (name, price, image).\n- Handling of \"No results found\" scenarios.\n- Responsiveness of the search functionality across different browsers and devices.\n- Basic security checks related to input fields.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n- Complete end-to-end e-commerce flows (e.g., adding to cart, checkout).\n- Detailed performance testing (load testing, stress testing).  *Note: Basic performance (response time) should be monitored within the regression suite.*\n- A/B testing or multivariate testing of search algorithms.\n- Detailed accessibility testing.\n- Advanced security testing (penetration testing).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThis suite ensures the core functionality of the application is operational. It should be executed after each build deployment.\n\n- **Test Case 1: Basic Site Load & Product Page Navigation:**\n    1. Navigate to `https://automationexercise.com/`.\n    2. Verify the homepage loads successfully (e.g., page title is correct, key elements are present).\n    3. Click on the \"Products\" button.\n    4. Verify the Products page loads successfully.\n- **Test Case 2: Basic Product Search:**\n    1. Navigate to the Products page.\n    2. Enter a common product keyword (e.g., \"dress\") in the search field.\n    3. Submit the search.\n    4. Verify that search results are displayed.\n\n### Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThis suite provides comprehensive testing of the product search functionality.\n\n- **Positive Scenarios:**\n    - **Exact Match Search:** Search for a product by its exact name.\n    - **Partial Match Search:** Search for a product using partial keywords.\n    - **Case-Insensitive Search:** Verify search is not case-sensitive.\n    - **Search by Category (if applicable):** If product categories are searchable, test searching by category.\n    - **Search with Multiple Keywords:** Search using a combination of keywords.\n    - **Pagination:** Navigate through multiple pages of search results.\n    - **Sorting:** Test sorting functionality (e.g., by price, popularity).\n    - **Search for Products with Special Characters in Name:** Ensure products with special characters (e.g., hyphens, apostrophes) are found.\n\n- **Negative Scenarios:**\n    - **Empty Search:** Submit an empty search query.\n    - **Invalid Characters:** Search with invalid characters (e.g., `!@#$%^`).\n    - **Long Search String:** Submit an extremely long search query.\n    - **SQL Injection Attempt:** Enter potentially malicious SQL code in the search field.  *(Basic check, not full PenTest)*\n    - **XSS Attempt:** Enter potentially malicious JavaScript code in the search field. *(Basic check, not full PenTest)*\n    - **Search for Non-Existent Product:** Search for a product that is known not to exist.\n    - **Search for Out-of-Stock Product (if applicable):** Verify that out-of-stock products are handled correctly (e.g., displayed with a \"Sold Out\" message or filtered out).\n\n- **Edge Cases:**\n    - **Concurrency:** Simulate multiple users searching simultaneously. (This can be part of a separate performance test but should be considered during design).\n    - **Network Latency:** Test the search functionality under simulated network latency conditions.\n\n- **Data Strategy:**\n    - **Static Data:**  A set of known product names and keywords should be maintained for consistent testing.\n    - **Dynamic Data Generation:**  Consider generating random search strings to test the robustness of the input validation.  A 'negative keyword' list should also be managed with strings known to not be products.\n    - **Data Refresh:** Ensure the test data (product names, categories) is synchronized with the live system, especially after product catalog updates.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n- **Framework Recommendation:**\n    - **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Products page and search functionality. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n        - **`ProductsPage`:**  Encapsulates the elements and actions related to the Products page (search field, search button, search results, pagination).\n        - **`SearchResult`:** Represents a single search result item (product name, price, image).\n\n- **Resilience Strategy:**\n    - **Polling Assertions (Explicit Waits):** Use explicit waits with polling to handle asynchronous behavior and dynamic content loading (e.g., waiting for search results to appear).\n    - **Self-Healing (Optional):**  Investigate self-healing techniques (e.g., using relative locators) to automatically adapt to minor UI changes. However, prioritize stable locators first.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n- **Mining Targets (Prioritized Pages/Flows for Autonomous Exploration):**\n    1. **Products Page (`/products`):** This is the primary focus area.\n    2. **Search Input Field:**  Pay special attention to the behavior of the search input field with different types of inputs.\n    3. **Search Results Section:**  Analyze how search results are displayed, paginated, and sorted.\n    4. **\"No Results Found\" Page (if applicable):** Ensure this page is displayed correctly when no matching products are found.\n\n- **Verification Criteria:**\n    - **HTTP Status Codes:**  Verify that all requests return a `200 OK` status code (or other appropriate status codes for redirects or errors).\n    - **Page Titles:**  Verify the correct page titles are displayed.\n    - **Element Visibility:**  Verify that key elements (e.g., search results, pagination controls) are visible and correctly positioned.\n    - **Text Content:**  Verify that text content matches expectations (e.g., product names, prices, \"No results found\" message).\n    - **Search Accuracy:**  Validate that the search results are relevant to the search query.  This may require manual inspection in some cases, but automated checks can be implemented for exact matches and keyword inclusion.\n    - **Performance Metrics:**  Monitor the response time of the search functionality.  Establish a baseline and flag any significant deviations."
