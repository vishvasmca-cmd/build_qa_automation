  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. Here's a Master Test Strategy document for automationexercise.com, focusing on regression testing and the specific user goal of navigating to the Products page and searching for a product.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com - Product Search\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://automationexercise.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n**User Goal:** Navigate to Products page and search for a product\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n**1.1 Domain Analysis:**\n\nAutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. Key functionalities include product browsing, searching, adding to cart, checkout, and account management.  Given the e-commerce nature, the **Product Search** functionality is considered **P1** (High Priority) because it directly impacts the user's ability to find and purchase products.\n\n**1.2 Risk Profile:**\n\nFailure of the Product Search functionality can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Users unable to find products will not make purchases.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Frustrated users may abandon the site and leave negative reviews.\n*   **Lost Sales Opportunities:** Inability to capitalize on marketing campaigns or promotions.\n\n**1.3 Testing Scope:**\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Navigation to the Products page.\n    *   Search functionality (keyword search, category filtering - if available).\n    *   Display of search results (product listings, pagination).\n    *   Product details page access from search results.\n    *   Error handling (e.g., no results found, invalid search terms).\n    *   Responsiveness of the Products page and search results on different devices (desktop, mobile).\n    *   Performance of the search functionality (search speed, page load times).\n    *   Security aspects related to search input (e.g., preventing XSS).\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Checkout process (covered in separate test strategy).\n    *   Account management (covered in separate test strategy).\n    *   API testing (unless directly related to the Product Search functionality).\n    *   Detailed performance testing beyond basic load times.\n    *   A/B testing of search algorithms.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n**2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\nThe Smoke Suite will ensure the basic health of the application, specifically related to accessing the Products page.\n\n*   **Test Case 1:** Verify the application is accessible.\n    *   Steps: Navigate to https://automationexercise.com/\n    *   Expected Result: The home page loads successfully (HTTP 200, page content visible).\n*   **Test Case 2:** Verify navigation to the Products page.\n    *   Steps: Click on the \"Products\" link in the navigation menu.\n    *   Expected Result: The Products page loads successfully (HTTP 200, product listings visible).\n\n**2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n\nThe Regression Suite will thoroughly test the Product Search functionality.\n\n*   **2.2.1 Negative Testing:**\n    *   **Invalid Search Terms:** Search for non-existent products (e.g., \"asdfghjkl\"). Verify appropriate \"No results found\" message is displayed.\n    *   **Empty Search Query:** Submit an empty search query. Verify appropriate error message or behavior (e.g., redirect to Products page).\n    *   **Special Characters:** Search for products containing special characters (e.g., \"$%^&*\"). Verify the application handles these characters gracefully (either by stripping them or escaping them).\n    *   **SQL Injection Attempts:**  Input potentially malicious strings into the search bar (e.g., `'; DROP TABLE products;--`). Verify the application is protected against SQL injection attacks.\n*   **2.2.2 Edge Cases:**\n    *   **Case Sensitivity:** Search for products using different capitalization (e.g., \"shirt\" vs. \"Shirt\"). Verify search results are case-insensitive.\n    *   **Partial Matches:** Search for a partial product name (e.g., \"shir\" for \"shirt\"). Verify relevant results are returned.\n    *   **Large Number of Results:** Search for a common term (e.g., \"top\"). Verify pagination works correctly and the page loads efficiently.\n    *   **Network Failures:** Simulate network failures during the search process. Verify the application handles these failures gracefully (e.g., displays an error message).\n    *   **Concurrency:** Multiple users searching simultaneously. Verify the application can handle concurrent requests without performance degradation.\n*   **2.2.3 Security:**\n    *   **XSS Prevention:** Input potentially malicious JavaScript code into the search bar (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`). Verify the application is protected against XSS attacks.\n*   **2.2.4 Functional Testing:**\n    *   **Search by Keyword:** Verify accurate results are returned based on keyword search.\n    *   **Category Filtering (If Available):** Verify filtering by product category works correctly.\n    *   **Sorting (If Available):** Verify sorting options (e.g., price, popularity) work correctly.\n    *   **Pagination:** Verify pagination works correctly, allowing users to navigate through all search results.\n    *   **Product Details Page:** Verify clicking on a product in the search results navigates to the correct product details page.\n    *   **Responsiveness:** Verify the Products page and search results are displayed correctly on different screen sizes (desktop, mobile, tablet).\n\n**2.3 Data Strategy:**\n\n*   **Static Data:** A small set of static data (e.g., predefined search terms, expected product names) will be used for basic functional testing.\n*   **Dynamic Data Generation:** For negative testing and edge cases, dynamic data generation will be used to create a wider range of test inputs (e.g., random strings, special characters).  This can be achieved through scripting or using data-driven testing techniques.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n**3.1 Framework Recommendation:**\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent the Products page and its elements (search bar, search button, product listings, pagination). This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n\n**3.2 Resilience Strategy:**\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) to handle asynchronous loading of search results. This will reduce flakiness caused by timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing (Consider):** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI to automatically locate elements) to address issues caused by UI changes.  This is a more advanced technique and should be evaluated based on the frequency of UI changes.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n**4.1 Mining Targets:**\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n*   **Products Page:** https://automationexercise.com/products\n*   **Search Functionality:** Focus on the search bar and search button on the Products page.\n*   **Product Details Pages:** Explore the links to individual product details pages from the search results.\n\n**4.2 Verification Criteria:**\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant product listings are displayed based on the search query.\n    *   \"No results found\" message is displayed when no matching products are found.\n    *   Navigation to product details pages is successful.\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Incorrect or missing search results.\n    *   Application crashes or freezes.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).\n    *   JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the Product Search functionality on AutomationExercise.com. It will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the testing process.\n"
