  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: DemoBlaze E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the DemoBlaze e-commerce application (https://www.demoblaze.com/). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nDemoBlaze is an e-commerce application. Key functionalities include product browsing, adding items to the cart, user registration/login, and order placement.  The **Checkout process is considered P0 (Priority 0)** due to its direct impact on revenue generation.  User registration and login are also critical for personalized experiences and order tracking.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the DemoBlaze application can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders, leading to lost revenue.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative user experience due to bugs, leading to loss of customer trust.\n*   **Data Security Breach:** Vulnerabilities could expose sensitive user data (e.g., credit card information, personal details).\n*   **Operational Disruption:** Inability to manage inventory, process shipments, and provide customer support.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **All core e-commerce functionalities:**\n    *   User Registration and Login\n    *   Product Browsing and Search\n    *   Adding Items to Cart\n    *   Checkout Process (including payment gateway integration - if applicable)\n    *   Order Management (viewing order history)\n    *   Contact Us form\n*   **UI/UX Testing:**\n    *   Responsiveness across different browsers and devices\n    *   Accessibility (basic checks)\n*   **Security Testing:**\n    *   OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (basic checks)\n*   **Performance Testing:**\n    *   Load time for key pages (homepage, product pages, checkout)\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Comprehensive Performance Testing:**  Load, stress, and endurance testing beyond basic load time checks.\n*   **Advanced Security Testing:** Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning.\n*   **Detailed Accessibility Testing:**  WCAG compliance audits.\n*   **Integration Testing with external systems:**  (Beyond basic payment gateway integration if applicable).  This would require more information about the system architecture.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure the system's basic health.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  Verify Homepage Loads Successfully (HTTP 200 OK)\n    2.  Verify User Registration is successful with valid data.\n    3.  Verify User Login is successful with valid credentials.\n    4.  Verify a product can be added to the cart.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will be executed to ensure that new changes haven't broken existing functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid Login attempts (incorrect username/password).\n    *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart.\n    *   Submitting forms with missing or invalid data (e.g., empty fields, invalid email format).\n    *   Entering excessively long text in input fields.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures during checkout (simulating dropped connections).\n    *   Handling empty states (e.g., empty cart, no search results).\n    *   Testing with different browsers and devices (cross-browser compatibility).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks (basic checks on all input fields).\n    *   Checking for secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card information).\n*   **Functional Testing:**\n    *   Verify product details are displayed correctly.\n    *   Verify cart functionality (add, remove, update quantities).\n    *   Verify checkout process (address entry, payment options, order confirmation).\n    *   Verify order history is displayed correctly.\n    *   Verify contact form submission.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **User Data:**\n    *   **Dynamic Generation:**  Generate unique usernames and email addresses for each test run to avoid conflicts.  Consider using a library like Faker.\n    *   **Data Storage:**  Store generated user credentials in a secure location for reuse during the test run (e.g., in-memory data structure).  Do *not* store credentials in plain text in the test code.\n*   **Product Data:**\n    *   **Static Data:**  Use a predefined set of product IDs and names for testing.  Store this data in a configuration file.\n*   **Payment Data:**\n    *   **Test Payment Gateway:**  If a payment gateway is integrated, use test credit card numbers and expiration dates provided by the payment gateway provider.  *Never* use real credit card information.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class.  This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Each page object should contain:\n        *   Locators for all elements on the page (e.g., buttons, input fields, labels).\n        *   Methods for interacting with the elements on the page (e.g., click a button, enter text into a field).\n*   **Test Framework:**  Recommend using a popular and well-supported testing framework such as Selenium WebDriver with JUnit or TestNG (Java), or Playwright or Cypress (JavaScript).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or enabled before interacting with them.  This will help to avoid flakiness caused by timing issues.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement a mechanism to automatically retry failed tests.  This can be done by wrapping test steps in try-catch blocks and retrying the step if it fails.  Limit the number of retries to avoid infinite loops.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Element Existence Checks:** Before interacting with an element, verify that it exists on the page.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify basic layout, navigation, and product listings.\n2.  **Product Pages:** Verify product details, images, and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n3.  **Cart Page:** Verify cart contents, quantity updates, and \"Place Order\" button.\n4.  **Signup Page:** Verify form fields, validation messages, and successful account creation.\n5.  **Login Page:** Verify form fields, validation messages, and successful login.\n6.  **Checkout Process:** Verify address entry, payment options (if applicable), and order confirmation.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 OK status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected text and elements are visible on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product name on product page).\n    *   Forms can be submitted successfully without errors.\n    *   Data is saved correctly (e.g., user registration, adding items to cart).\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Incorrect data being displayed.\n    *   Forms failing to submit.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities detected.\n"
