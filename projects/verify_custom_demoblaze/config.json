  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: DemoBlaze E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the DemoBlaze e-commerce application (https://www.demoblaze.com/). It serves as a blueprint for all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimizing risks associated with software releases. This strategy prioritizes regression testing with a focus on user signup and login flows.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nDemoBlaze is an e-commerce application. Key functionalities include product browsing, adding items to the cart, user registration/login, and order placement.  Given the e-commerce nature, the following areas are considered high-risk:\n\n*   **User Registration and Login:** Critical for user access and personalization. Failure can lead to account lockout, data breaches, and loss of user trust.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Accurate product information (price, availability, description) is crucial.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Correct item quantities, pricing, and discounts are essential.\n*   **Checkout Process:** Secure and reliable payment processing is paramount.\n*   **Order Management:** Accurate order tracking and fulfillment are vital for customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the DemoBlaze application can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect pricing, failed transactions, and lost sales.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised user data (personal information, payment details).\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust due to application errors and security vulnerabilities.\n*   **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Non-compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Functional Testing:** All core e-commerce functionalities (product browsing, cart management, checkout, user registration/login).\n*   **Regression Testing:** Ensuring existing functionalities are not broken by new changes.\n*   **Negative Testing:** Validating error handling and input validation.\n*   **Security Testing:** Basic OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (input validation, authentication).\n*   **Usability Testing:** Assessing the ease of use and user experience.\n*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing:** Ensuring the application works correctly on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   **Performance Testing:** Evaluating the application's responsiveness and scalability under load. (Basic load testing)\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Comprehensive Performance Testing:** Detailed load, stress, and endurance testing.\n*   **Advanced Security Testing:** Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning.\n*   **Accessibility Testing:** Compliance with WCAG guidelines.\n*   **Localization Testing:** Support for multiple languages and regions.\n*   **Mobile App Testing:** Testing the mobile version of the application (if any).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the application's basic functionality is working.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify the application homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n    *   Verify user can navigate to the signup page.\n    *   Verify user can successfully sign up with valid credentials.\n    *   Verify user can successfully log in with valid credentials.\n    *   Verify user can browse products.\n    *   Verify user can add a product to the cart.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will be executed to ensure that new changes have not broken existing functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   **User Registration:**\n        *   Invalid email format.\n        *   Password too short/weak.\n        *   Username already exists.\n        *   Missing required fields.\n    *   **Login:**\n        *   Invalid username/password.\n        *   Account locked out after multiple failed attempts.\n    *   **Checkout:**\n        *   Invalid credit card number.\n        *   Expired credit card.\n        *   Missing billing/shipping information.\n        *   Insufficient funds.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   **Concurrency:** Multiple users accessing the same product simultaneously.\n    *   **Network Failures:** Intermittent network connectivity during checkout.\n    *   **Empty States:** Empty shopping cart, no search results.\n    *   **Boundary Analysis:** Maximum quantity of items in the cart, maximum length of input fields.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.\n    *   **Authentication:** Secure password storage and transmission.\n    *   **Session Management:** Secure session handling to prevent hijacking.\n*   **Specific Regression Scenarios (Focus on Signup/Login):**\n    *   Verify successful signup with different valid email providers (gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc.).\n    *   Verify password reset functionality.\n    *   Verify account deletion functionality (if available).\n    *   Verify user profile update functionality (if available).\n    *   Verify error messages are clear and informative.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined usernames, passwords, and product information.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Randomly generated email addresses, credit card numbers (using Luhn algorithm), and order details.\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   Test data will be stored in a secure and centralized location (e.g., database, configuration files).\n    *   Data masking and anonymization techniques will be used to protect sensitive data.\n    *   Test data will be regularly refreshed to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application will be represented by a Page Object, which encapsulates the page's elements and actions.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to become visible or enabled before interacting with them.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading.\n    *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests that fail intermittently.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify basic elements and navigation.\n2.  **Signup Page:** Thoroughly explore all input fields and error messages.\n3.  **Login Page:** Test with valid and invalid credentials.\n4.  **Product Listing Page:** Verify product display and filtering options.\n5.  **Product Detail Page:** Verify product information and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n6.  **Cart Page:** Verify item quantities, pricing, and checkout button.\n7.  **Checkout Page:** Verify payment options and order confirmation.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for all pages.\n    *   Expected elements are visible on each page.\n    *   User can successfully sign up and log in.\n    *   User can add products to the cart and proceed to checkout.\n    *   Error messages are displayed correctly for invalid inputs.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).\n    *   Unexpected exceptions or crashes.\n    *   Incorrect data displayed on the page.\n    *   User cannot complete critical workflows (signup, login, checkout).\n    *   Security vulnerabilities detected.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the DemoBlaze e-commerce application.\n"
