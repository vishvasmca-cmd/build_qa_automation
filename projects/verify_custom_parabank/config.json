  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ParaBank Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the ParaBank application (https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm). It serves as a blueprint for all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimizing risks associated with software releases.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nParaBank operates within the **Banking** domain. This domain is characterized by high criticality due to the sensitive nature of financial data and the potential for significant financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties in case of system failures. The core business functions revolve around account management, transaction processing, and customer data security.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the ParaBank application can lead to the following risks:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect transactions, unauthorized access, and data breaches can result in direct financial losses for both the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised customer data (PII, financial information) can lead to legal repercussions, regulatory fines, and severe reputational damage.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust due to system failures, security breaches, or poor performance can significantly impact the bank's brand and customer base.\n*   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with banking regulations (e.g., KYC, AML) can result in hefty fines and legal action.\n*   **Operational Disruption:** System outages can disrupt critical banking operations, impacting customer service and business continuity.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Account Access:** Login, registration, profile management, password recovery, session management.\n*   **Account Management:** Viewing account details, balance inquiries, transaction history, statement generation.\n*   **Transfers & Payments:** Internal fund transfers, bill payments, external transfers, payee management, scheduled payments.\n*   **Customer Service:** Contact information, FAQs, support requests.\n*   **Security:** Authentication, authorization, data encryption, input validation.\n*   **Accessibility:** Compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG).\n*   **Performance:** Load times, response times, scalability.\n*   **Database Integrity:** Data consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Third-Party Integrations:** (Unless explicitly defined and documented)\n*   **Hardware Testing:** (Focus is on software functionality)\n*   **Infrastructure Testing:** (Responsibility of the infrastructure team)\n*   **Detailed Performance Benchmarking:** (High-level performance checks are in scope)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will serve as a rapid health check to ensure the core functionality of the application is operational after each build.\n\n*   **Purpose:** Verify the stability and basic functionality of the application.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment to a test environment.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify application is up and running (HTTP 200 OK).\n    *   Successful Customer Login.\n    *   View Account Summary page.\n    *   Perform a simple internal fund transfer (Checking to Savings).\n    *   New User Registration.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive testing to ensure that new changes have not introduced defects into existing functionality.\n\n*   **Purpose:** Ensure that new features and bug fixes do not negatively impact existing functionality.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** Before each major release and after significant code changes.\n*   **Test Areas:**\n\n    *   **Account Access:**\n        *   Login with invalid credentials (Negative Testing).\n        *   Login with Biometrics/MFA (if implemented).\n        *   Recover Forgotten Username/Password.\n        *   Session Timeout Handling.\n        *   Account Registration with invalid data (Negative Testing).\n    *   **Account Management:**\n        *   View Account Details for different account types (Checking, Savings, Loan).\n        *   Download Statement (PDF/CSV).\n        *   Search Transactions by Keyword.\n        *   Filter Transactions by Amount Range.\n    *   **Transfers & Payments:**\n        *   Transfer exceeding balance (Insufficient Funds).\n        *   Transfer exceeding daily limit.\n        *   Schedule Future Date Transfer.\n        *   Add New Payee/Beneficiary with valid and invalid data (Negative Testing).\n        *   Bill Payment with valid and invalid data (Negative Testing).\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks (SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting) on all input fields.\n        *   Authentication and authorization testing.\n        *   Data encryption verification.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency testing (multiple users accessing the same account simultaneously).\n        *   Network failure simulation (e.g., simulating a dropped connection during a transaction).\n        *   Empty states (e.g., no transaction history).\n        *   Boundary value analysis (e.g., minimum and maximum transfer amounts).\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid input data for all fields (e.g., special characters, long strings).\n        *   Attempting unauthorized access to accounts.\n        *   Submitting incomplete forms.\n    *   **Accessibility:**\n        *   Verify compliance with WCAG guidelines using automated tools and manual testing.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data Source:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n*   **Static Data:** A set of pre-defined test accounts with varying balances and transaction histories will be maintained.\n*   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Test data will be dynamically generated using scripts or tools to cover a wider range of scenarios and edge cases.  This is especially important for negative testing and boundary value analysis.\n*   **Data Masking:** Sensitive data (e.g., account numbers, social security numbers) will be masked or anonymized in test environments to protect customer privacy.\n*   **Data Refresh:** Test data will be refreshed regularly to ensure it remains relevant and accurate.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should be represented as a separate Page Object, encapsulating the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n*   **Language:** Java or Python are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n*   **Test Automation Framework:** Selenium WebDriver with TestNG or JUnit.\n*   **Reporting:** Integrate with a reporting tool such as Allure Report or Extent Reports for clear and concise test results.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid using implicit waits, as they can lead to unpredictable test behavior. Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically identify and recover from common test failures, such as element locators that have changed.  Consider using tools that leverage AI to dynamically update locators.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism to automatically retry failed tests a limited number of times. This can help to mitigate flakiness caused by temporary network issues or environment instability.\n*   **Test Environment Stability:** Ensure that the test environment is stable and reliable. This includes regular maintenance, monitoring, and proactive identification of potential issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Home Page:** Verify basic elements and links.\n2.  **Registration Page:** Explore all input fields and validation messages.  Focus on negative testing (invalid data).\n3.  **Login Page:** Test with valid and invalid credentials.\n4.  **Account Summary Page:** Verify account details and transaction history.\n5.  **Transfer Funds Page:** Explore different transfer scenarios (internal, external, scheduled).\n6.  **Bill Payment Page:** Test with valid and invalid payee information.\n7.  **Update Contact Info:** Test with valid and invalid contact information.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Page Load:** HTTP 200 OK status code and expected page title.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Key elements (e.g., buttons, input fields, labels) are visible and interactable.\n*   **Data Accuracy:** Data displayed on the page matches the expected values.\n*   **Validation Messages:** Appropriate validation messages are displayed for invalid input.\n*   **Successful Transactions:** Transactions are processed correctly and reflected in account balances.\n*   **Security Checks:** No evidence of SQL injection or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.\n*   **Accessibility Compliance:** Pages meet basic accessibility requirements (e.g., proper use of ARIA attributes).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the ParaBank application.\n"
