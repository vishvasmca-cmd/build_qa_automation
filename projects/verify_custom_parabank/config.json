  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ParaBank New Account Registration\n\nThis document outlines the comprehensive test strategy for the New Account Registration flow within the ParaBank application, focusing on regression testing. It serves as the guiding blueprint for the entire engineering team, ensuring a robust and reliable testing process.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** ParaBank operates within the critical domain of online banking. The New Account Registration flow is a *critical* path for acquiring new customers and is fundamental to business growth. Any failures in this area directly impact revenue, customer trust, and brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failures during new account registration can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect account creation could expose the bank to financial liabilities.\n    *   **Data Breach:** Security vulnerabilities could compromise sensitive customer information.\n    *   **Trust Loss:** A frustrating or unreliable registration process can deter potential customers, damaging the bank's reputation.\n    *   **Compliance Issues:** Failure to comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All aspects of the New Account Registration flow, including data input validation, account type selection, confirmation screens, and database updates.\n        *   Integration with other modules like Customer Login and Customer Profile Management (if applicable).\n        *   Security aspects related to data transmission and storage.\n        *   Accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress, etc.) \u2013 handled separately.\n        *   Detailed browser-specific rendering issues (covered by targeted cross-browser compatibility testing).\n        *   Back-end infrastructure (server, database) testing in isolation (covered by dedicated infrastructure teams).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   Objective: To confirm the *fundamental* operability of the registration entry point.\n    *   Test Cases:\n        1.  Navigate to the New Account Registration page.\n        2.  Verify that all required fields are present (Name, Address, SSN, Username, Password).\n        3.  Submit the form with *valid, minimal* data and verify successful redirection to a confirmation page *without errors*.\n        4.  Verify that the confirmation page displays key registration details (e.g., username).\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**:\n    *   Objective: To ensure that all aspects of the New Account Registration flow function correctly after any code changes, covering variations, edge cases, and potential vulnerabilities.\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        1.  Submit the form with missing required fields (verify appropriate error messages).\n        2.  Submit the form with invalid data formats (e.g., invalid email address, phone number, SSN).\n        3.  Attempt to create an account with an existing username.\n        4.  Submit passwords that do not meet complexity requirements (e.g., too short, no special characters).\n        5.  Attempt to use special characters/SQL injection attempts in form fields and verify proper sanitization.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        1.  Submit the form with extremely long strings in all text fields (boundary analysis).\n        2.  Simultaneous registration attempts from multiple users (concurrency).\n        3.  Simulate network timeouts during registration.\n        4.  Test with empty or null values in non-required fields.\n        5.  Account creation with different Account types (checking, savings, etc). Test the flow for all account types.\n    *   **Security:**\n        1.  **OWASP Top 10 (Basics):**\n            *   **SQL Injection:** Attempt to inject SQL code into input fields (username, password, address) and verify that the application prevents database manipulation.\n            *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attempt to inject JavaScript code into input fields and verify that the application sanitizes the input to prevent malicious scripts from running in the browser.\n            *   **Broken Authentication:** Test password reset functionality to ensure it's secure and prevents unauthorized access.\n            *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Ensure sensitive data (SSN) is encrypted both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database).\n        2.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement brute-force protection mechanisms to prevent password guessing attacks.\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Utilize a data generation library (e.g., Faker) to create realistic, yet synthetic, test data for each test run. This avoids data duplication issues and ensures a variety of input values.  This is especially important for fields like names, addresses, and SSNs.\n        *   **Data Repository:**  Maintain a repository of \"known\" data (e.g., existing usernames) for specific negative test cases.\n        *   **Sensitive Data Handling:**  Never use real customer data for testing. Always use masked or synthetic data.  Ensure test data is securely stored and disposed of after use.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page or component within the New Account Registration flow. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n        *   Example: `RegistrationPage`, `ConfirmationPage`.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be present or visible) to handle asynchronous operations and prevent flaky tests due to timing issues.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to handle common UI changes. This could involve using more robust element locators (e.g., XPath with text-based matching) that are less likely to break due to minor UI modifications.\n    *   **Retry Logic:** Implement retry logic for failed test steps due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Prioritized Exploration):**\n    1.  `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/register.htm` (Registration Form) - Focus on input field variations and validation.\n    2.  The \"Open New Account\" page linked after Registration (if applicable)\n    3.  Account Summary page post registration to ensure account creation.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Successful Registration:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: `200 OK` (or `302 Redirect` followed by `200 OK` for successful redirection).\n        *   Confirmation Message: Verify the presence of a \"Welcome\" message or a confirmation statement containing the newly registered username.\n        *   Database Verification (Back-End): Verify the existence of the new account record in the database.\n    *   **Error Handling:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: `200 OK` (unless a server error occurs, then `5xx`).\n        *   Error Messages: Verify that appropriate and user-friendly error messages are displayed for invalid input.  Ensure these messages are clear, concise, and helpful to the user.\n        *   Form State: Ensure that the form retains the user's previously entered data when an error occurs, to avoid forcing the user to re-enter all information."
