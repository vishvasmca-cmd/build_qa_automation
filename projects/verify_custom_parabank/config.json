  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ParaBank Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the ParaBank application (https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm). It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring comprehensive coverage of critical functionalities.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nParaBank operates within the **Banking** domain. This domain is characterized by high criticality due to the sensitive nature of financial transactions and customer data.\n\n*   **Criticality:** High. Financial transactions, account management, and personal data security are paramount.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the ParaBank application can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect transactions, unauthorized access, and data breaches can result in direct financial losses for both the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised customer data (PII, financial information) can lead to legal and reputational damage.\n*   **Loss of Trust:** System instability and errors erode customer trust, potentially leading to account closures and loss of business.\n*   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Failure to meet regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR) can result in fines and legal action.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Account Access:** Login, registration, profile management, password recovery.\n*   **Account Summary:** Viewing account balances, transaction history, and account details.\n*   **Transfers & Payments:** Internal transfers, bill payments, external transfers.\n*   **Statements & History:** Generating and downloading account statements.\n*   **Customer Service:** Contacting customer support, accessing FAQs.\n*   **New Account Registration:** The primary user goal of registering a new account.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing, and endurance testing (addressed in a separate strategy).\n*   **Penetration Testing:** Advanced security vulnerability assessments (handled by a dedicated security team).\n*   **Accessibility Testing:** Detailed WCAG compliance checks (handled by a dedicated accessibility specialist).\n*   **Localization Testing:** Testing for different languages and regions.\n*   **Third-Party Integrations:** Detailed testing of integrations with external services (e.g., payment gateways) beyond basic functionality.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite provides a rapid health check of the application's core functionality.\n\n*   **Goal:** Verify that the application is generally functional and ready for more in-depth testing.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify application is up and running (HTTP 200 OK).\n    *   Customer Login with valid credentials.\n    *   View Account Summary page after login.\n    *   New Account Registration.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite provides comprehensive testing to ensure that new changes haven't broken existing functionality.\n\n*   **Goal:** Detect regressions introduced by new code changes.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment, before release.\n*   **Test Areas:**\n\n    *   **Account Access:**\n        *   Login with invalid credentials (negative testing).\n        *   Login with Biometrics/MFA (if implemented).\n        *   Recover Forgotten Username/Password.\n        *   Session Timeout Handling.\n    *   **Account Summary:**\n        *   Verify account details are displayed correctly.\n        *   Verify transaction history is accurate.\n    *   **Transfers & Payments:**\n        *   Internal Fund Transfer (Checking to Savings).\n        *   Bill Payment (Standard).\n        *   Transfer exceeding balance (Insufficient Funds).\n        *   Transfer exceeding daily limit.\n        *   Schedule Future Date Transfer.\n        *   Add New Payee/Beneficiary.\n        *   Verify transfer confirmation messages.\n    *   **Statements & History:**\n        *   View Recent Transactions.\n        *   Download Statement (PDF/CSV).\n        *   Search Transactions by Keyword.\n        *   Filter Transactions by Amount Range.\n    *   **New Account Registration:**\n        *   Register with valid data.\n        *   Register with invalid data (e.g., missing fields, invalid email).\n        *   Register with existing username.\n        *   Verify account creation confirmation.\n\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid inputs in all forms (e.g., special characters, SQL injection attempts).\n        *   Boundary values for numerical fields (e.g., minimum/maximum transfer amounts).\n        *   Simulate timeouts and network failures.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency: Multiple users accessing the same account simultaneously.\n        *   Empty states: Handling scenarios with no transaction history or account data.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on all input fields (SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting).\n        *   Verify secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, account numbers).\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data Source:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n*   **Static Data:** A set of pre-defined test accounts with varying balances and transaction histories.\n*   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Use scripts to generate realistic but non-sensitive data for new account registration and other scenarios.\n*   **Data Masking:** Ensure that sensitive data is masked or anonymized in test environments.\n*   **Data Refresh:** Regularly refresh test data to prevent data staleness and ensure test accuracy.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM architecture to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should be represented by a Page Object, encapsulating the page's elements and actions.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait-until conditions) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Implement Self-Healing:** Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures, such as element locators that change frequently.\n*   **Retry Logic:** Implement retry logic for flaky tests, especially those involving network requests or external services.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure that elements are loaded before interacting with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Home Page:** Verify basic elements and links.\n2.  **New Account Registration:** Thoroughly explore all registration fields and validation messages.\n3.  **Login Page:** Test valid and invalid login attempts.\n4.  **Account Summary Page:** Verify account balances, transaction history, and account details.\n5.  **Transfer Funds Page:** Test internal and external transfers with various amounts and scenarios.\n6.  **Bill Payment Page:** Test bill payments with different payees and amounts.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 OK status code for all page requests.\n    *   Relevant text and elements are visible on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, account balance on Account Summary page).\n    *   Form submissions are successful and result in the expected outcome (e.g., account creation confirmation, successful transfer message).\n    *   No JavaScript errors are present in the browser console.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Missing or incorrect elements on the page.\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the ParaBank application. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the quality, reliability, and security of the application.\n"
