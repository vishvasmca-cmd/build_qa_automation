  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Smoke Testing for adsrvr.org\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the adsrvr.org website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** adsrvr.org is a general web application. The specific business model is unknown, but the presence of login/signup indicates a user-account based service.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of core functionality (website launch, login, signup) can lead to immediate user attrition and damage to the company's reputation. Financial loss is a potential consequence if the service is revenue-generating.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page rendering.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free buttons (5 total), 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Verification of the *presence* of these elements on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Form submission or data validation.\n        *   Error handling or negative testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   API testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis smoke test strategy focuses on verifying the basic health of the application.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n    1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website loads successfully.\n    2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of the specified UI elements (5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n\n*   **Regression Suite:** N/A - This is a smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined separately.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:** No test data is required for this smoke test, as it only verifies the presence of UI elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** While a full-fledged Page Object Model (POM) might be overkill for this simple smoke test, a basic structure is still recommended for maintainability. Create a `HomePage` class that encapsulates the locators for the target UI elements.\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible, especially after the initial page load. This helps mitigate flakiness due to slow loading times.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for the entire test suite. If the smoke test fails, retry it once or twice before marking the build as failed. This can help address transient network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n\n    1.  **Homepage (`/`):** This is the primary target for element identification.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n\n    1.  **Website Launch:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK.\n        *   Page Title: Contains a relevant title for adsrvr.org (e.g., \"adsrvr.org - Home\").\n    2.  **Element Identification:**\n        *   Buttons: Verify the presence of 5 buttons with text matching (or similar to) \"Login\", \"Signup\", \"Get Started\", \"Try for Free\" (or variations).\n        *   Links: Verify the presence of 2 links (<a> tags) with valid `href` attributes.\n        *   Menu Bars: Verify the presence of 2 menu bars (identified by appropriate HTML elements, e.g., `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<div>` with specific classes).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the adsrvr.org website. Adherence to this strategy will ensure that the core functionality of the application is verified effectively, minimizing the risk of critical failures."
