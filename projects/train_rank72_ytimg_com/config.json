  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: ytimg.com - Smoke Testing\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for smoke testing the ytimg.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to quality assurance.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** ytimg.com serves static images for YouTube. While not directly customer-facing, its availability is critical for YouTube's functionality. Outages directly impact user experience on YouTube.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure to serve images results in broken UI on YouTube, leading to user frustration and potential loss of viewership. The risk is considered **High** due to the direct impact on YouTube's core functionality.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and basic rendering.\n        *   Presence of key UI elements (buttons, links, menu bars) as defined in the user goal.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Image integrity and correctness.\n        *   Performance testing (image loading speed).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (beyond a single, representative browser).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Any functionality beyond the specified user goal.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and the basic UI elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n        2.  **UI Element Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for Smoke Testing.* Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for smoke testing. The focus is on UI element presence, not data validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   A lightweight framework is sufficient for smoke testing. Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability, even for a small suite.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains locators and methods for interacting with the homepage elements (buttons, links, menu bars).\n        *   `BaseTest.java`: Contains setup and teardown methods (e.g., browser initialization, driver management).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Mitigation:** Due to the simplicity of the smoke tests, flakiness is unlikely. However, implement a retry mechanism for element location in case of intermittent issues.\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to be present on the page before asserting their existence. This helps avoid timing issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`/`)**: The primary focus for identifying buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Availability:** HTTP status code 200 OK.\n    2.  **UI Element Presence:**\n        *   At least 5 distinct button elements are present on the page.\n        *   At least 2 distinct link elements are present on the page.\n        *   At least 2 distinct menu bar elements are present on the page.\n        *   Elements should be identifiable by their HTML tags (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>`, etc.).\n*   **Success Definition:** All verification criteria are met. If any criterion fails, the build is rejected."
