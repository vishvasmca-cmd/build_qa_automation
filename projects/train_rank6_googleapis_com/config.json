  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Googleapis.com - Smoke Testing\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for smoke testing the Googleapis.com website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Googleapis.com provides access to Google's APIs. While not a direct e-commerce site, its availability and core functionality are critical for developers and businesses relying on these APIs. Outages or critical errors can disrupt development workflows and impact downstream services.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Inability to access the website or critical API documentation can lead to developer frustration, project delays, and potential loss of trust in Google's services.\n    *   **Medium:** Broken links or non-functional buttons can hinder user experience and reduce the effectiveness of the website as a resource.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website availability and load time.\n        *   Presence and basic functionality of key elements on the homepage: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar), and 2 other prominent buttons.\n        *   Presence of 2 prominent links on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functionality of any API.\n        *   Clicking and navigating through the website beyond the initial page load and element verification.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing beyond basic load time.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the website is accessible, loads correctly, and essential elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Availability:** Verify the website loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n        2.  **Homepage Load Time:** Verify the homepage loads within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., < 5 seconds).\n        3.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   Login button/link\n            *   Signup/Get Started button/link (or equivalent)\n            *   \"Try for Free\" button/link (or equivalent)\n            *   Two other prominent buttons (e.g., \"Documentation,\" \"Pricing\")\n            *   Two prominent links (e.g., \"Terms of Service,\" \"Privacy Policy\")\n            *   Two menu bars (e.g., \"Products,\" \"Support\")\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for Smoke Testing)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for smoke tests, as we are only verifying the presence of elements.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the homepage and its elements. This will improve maintainability and reusability of test code.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains locators for all elements on the homepage (buttons, links, menus).\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains methods to interact with these elements (e.g., `isLoginButtonPresent()`, `isSignupLinkPresent()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues when elements are loading. This will reduce flakiness.\n    *   **Example:** Wait for the Login button to be present for a maximum of 5 seconds before failing the test.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for website availability checks. This can help mitigate transient network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://googleapis.com):** Focus on verifying the presence of the elements listed in the \"Testing Strategy\" section.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Availability:** HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Homepage Load Time:** Page loads within the defined threshold (e.g., < 5 seconds).\n    *   **Element Presence:** The specified buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page and are visible (i.e., not hidden by CSS).\n    *   **Success:** All verification criteria are met.\n    *   **Failure:** Any verification criteria are not met.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for smoke testing the Googleapis.com website. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the website's core functionality is working as expected, reducing the risk of critical issues impacting developers and businesses."
