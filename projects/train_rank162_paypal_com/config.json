  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: PayPal.com - Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** PayPal is a critical financial platform. Any failure can lead to immediate financial loss, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.\n*   **Risk Profile:** High. Failure of core functionalities (login, signup) directly impacts revenue and user trust. Data breaches are a major concern.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of key elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n        *   Basic UI element rendering (no broken images, layout issues).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functional testing of login, signup, or any other interactive elements.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n        *   API testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the PayPal website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the PayPal homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element:** Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup/Get Started Element:** Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element:** Verify the \"Try for Free\" button/link is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button Verification (5):** Verify the presence of 5 distinct buttons on the homepage.\n        6.  **Link Verification (2):** Verify the presence of 2 distinct links on the homepage.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Verification (2):** Verify the presence of 2 distinct menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Data Strategy:** No specific test data is required for smoke tests. We are only verifying the presence of elements.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability and readability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` Page Object containing locators for the Login, Signup, Try for Free buttons/links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible, especially after page load. This helps avoid flakiness due to slow loading times.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test execution. If a test fails due to a transient issue (e.g., network hiccup), retry the test a limited number of times before marking it as failed.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **PayPal Homepage (https://paypal.com):** This is the primary target for all smoke tests.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the main page title.\n    *   **Element Verification:** The specified elements (Login, Signup, Try for Free buttons/links, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present and visible on the page. Use appropriate locators (e.g., XPath, CSS selectors) to identify the elements.\n    *   **Success Definition:** All test cases pass, indicating that the website is accessible and the core elements are present."
