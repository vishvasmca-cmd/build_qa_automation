  "master_plan": "Okay, I understand. My mandate is to create a comprehensive Master Test Strategy for Saucedemo.com, focusing on regression testing and the specific user goal of logging in with the `standard_user` and `secret_sauce` credentials. Here's the plan:\n\n```markdown\n# Master Test Strategy: Saucedemo.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Saucedemo.com\n**Business Domain:** General E-commerce (Simulated)\n**Testing Type:** Regression\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nSaucedemo.com, while a demo application, simulates a typical e-commerce website. Key functionalities include:\n\n*   **Login:** User authentication and access control.\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying and filtering products.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Adding, removing, and managing items.\n*   **Checkout:** Completing the purchase process.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nAlthough a demo site, we treat it as a real e-commerce application for testing rigor. Potential risks associated with failures include:\n\n*   **Data Integrity:** Incorrect product information or order details.\n*   **Functional Defects:** Inability to add items to cart, complete checkout, or login.\n*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Exposure of user credentials or payment information (simulated).\n*   **Performance Issues:** Slow loading times or unresponsive UI.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to the user login flow (positive and negative scenarios).\n*   Product catalog browsing and filtering.\n*   Shopping cart functionality (add, remove, update).\n*   Checkout process (address, payment, confirmation).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).\n*   Basic UI responsiveness on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n*   Security testing for common vulnerabilities (see Regression Suite below).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance) - *unless specifically requested later*.\n*   Advanced accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - *unless specifically requested later*.\n*   Detailed API testing (beyond basic integration checks).\n*   Third-party integrations (payment gateways, shipping providers) - *unless specifically requested later*.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify application is accessible (HTTP 200 OK).\n    *   Verify Login with valid credentials (`standard_user` / `secret_sauce`).\n    *   Verify successful login redirects to the product catalog page.\n    *   Verify at least one product is displayed on the product catalog page.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Login Functionality:**\n    *   **Positive:** Login with valid credentials (`standard_user`, `secret_sauce`).\n    *   **Negative:**\n        *   Invalid username.\n        *   Invalid password.\n        *   Empty username and password.\n        *   Locked out user (`locked_out_user`).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Attempting to login with special characters in username/password.\n        *   Brute-force login attempts (rate limiting).\n*   **Product Catalog:**\n    *   Verify product display (name, description, price, image).\n    *   Verify product filtering (by price, name).\n    *   Verify product sorting (by price, name).\n*   **Shopping Cart:**\n    *   Add products to cart.\n    *   Remove products from cart.\n    *   Update product quantities in cart.\n    *   Verify cart total is correct.\n    *   Verify cart persists across sessions (if applicable).\n*   **Checkout:**\n    *   Complete checkout with valid shipping and payment information.\n    *   Complete checkout with missing shipping information.\n    *   Complete checkout with invalid payment information.\n    *   Verify order confirmation page.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   **Input Validation:** Test all input fields for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.\n    *   **Authentication:** Verify secure handling of user credentials.\n    *   **Authorization:** Verify users can only access authorized resources.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use predefined test data for core scenarios (e.g., `standard_user`, `secret_sauce`).\n    *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Generate random data for negative testing and edge cases (e.g., invalid usernames, passwords, addresses).  Faker library recommended.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should have a corresponding Page Object class that encapsulates the elements and actions on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits and use explicit waits to wait for specific elements to be present or visible before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures (e.g., retrying failed assertions, re-locating elements).\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `/` (Focus on all input fields and error messages).\n2.  **Product Catalog Page:** `/inventory.html` (Focus on product display, filtering, and sorting).\n3.  **Shopping Cart Page:** `/cart.html` (Focus on adding, removing, and updating items).\n4.  **Checkout Pages:** `/checkout-step-one.html`, `/checkout-step-two.html`, `/checkout-complete.html` (Focus on all input fields, validation messages, and order confirmation).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 OK status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected elements are present and visible on each page.\n    *   Validation messages are displayed correctly for invalid inputs.\n    *   User is successfully logged in with valid credentials.\n    *   Products can be added to and removed from the shopping cart.\n    *   Checkout process can be completed successfully.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Incorrect data or calculations.\n    *   Security vulnerabilities.\n    *   Broken links or images.\n\n```\n\nThis document provides a solid foundation for building a robust and maintainable test automation framework for Saucedemo.com. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and new requirements emerge.\n"
