# Test Plan: Europa.eu Website

## Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the Europa.eu website. The primary goal is to ensure the website's core functionality is working as expected and to identify any potential issues.

## Scope

The testing will cover the following areas:

*   Website launch and basic navigation.
*   Identification of buttons and links.

## Test Strategy

We will employ a combination of smoke and regression testing.

### Smoke Suite Strategy

The smoke suite will focus on verifying the most critical functionalities of the website. The following checklist will be applied:

1.  **Critical Path Coverage:** Tests cover essential user journeys (e.g., website launch).
2.  **Core Functionality:** Tests verify the basic functionality (e.g., identifying buttons and links).
3.  **Positive Testing:** Focus on successful scenarios.
4.  **No Negative Testing:** No tests for invalid inputs or error conditions.
5.  **Limited Scope:** Only the most important features are included.
6.  **Fast Execution:** Tests should be quick to execute.
7.  **Build Verification:** Used to determine if a build is stable enough for further testing.
8.  **Happy Path:** Focus on the ideal user flow.

### Regression Suite Strategy

The regression suite will provide a more comprehensive test coverage, including alternative flows, negative scenarios, and edge cases. (Not applicable for this trace, but included for completeness).

## Test Suites

1.  Smoke Suite: Verifies the website launches successfully and can identify buttons and links.
2.  Regression Suite: (Not applicable for this trace).

## Test Cases

Detailed test cases are defined in the feature files.
