  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Europa.eu Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the smoke testing of the Europa.eu website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, including Senior QAs, Test Architects, and SDETs, to ensure a consistent and effective approach to testing.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Europa.eu is the official website of the European Union. Its availability and functionality are crucial for disseminating information, providing access to services, and maintaining public trust.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the Europa.eu website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of public trust in the EU.\n    *   **Information Dissemination Failure:** Inability to communicate important information to citizens.\n    *   **Service Disruption:** Inability for citizens to access essential services.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page loading.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar) buttons (5 total).\n        *   Identification of 2 links.\n        *   Identification of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Detailed functionality of any specific section of the website.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n        *   Browser compatibility beyond the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.\n        *   Mobile device testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the website is accessible and the core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the Europa.eu homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons (Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free, or similar).\n        3.  **Link Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links.\n        4.  **Menu Bar Identification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars.\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for smoke testing.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   No specific test data is required for this smoke test, as it focuses on element presence and website accessibility.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   While a full Page Object Model (POM) might be overkill for this simple smoke test, a basic structure is still recommended for maintainability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` class that encapsulates the locators for the buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential delays in element loading. For example, wait for an element to be present for a short period before failing the test.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for website launch in case of temporary network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://europa.eu):** Focus on identifying the required elements on the homepage.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Identification:** The specified number of buttons, links, and menu bars are present on the page.\n    *   **No functional validation is required.** The tests only need to confirm the *presence* of the elements, not their functionality.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for the smoke testing of the Europa.eu website. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the website's basic functionality is working as expected."
