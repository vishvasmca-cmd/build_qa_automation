  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Europa.eu Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the smoke test suite of the Europa.eu website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** Europa.eu is the official website of the European Union. Its primary function is to provide information about the EU, its policies, and its institutions. The website is critical for public communication and transparency.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure of the Europa.eu website can lead to:\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Undermining public trust in the EU.\n    *   **Information Dissemination Failure:** Hindering the EU's ability to communicate important information to citizens.\n    *   **Accessibility Issues:** Preventing citizens from accessing essential services and information.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and basic page loading.\n        *   Existence and visibility of key elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, Try for Free (or similar) buttons (5 total).\n        *   Existence and visibility of 2 links.\n        *   Existence and visibility of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of buttons and links (clicking, navigation).\n        *   Detailed content verification.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing (beyond basic element presence).\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the website is accessible and key elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n        2.  **Button Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 5 buttons with labels like \"Login\", \"Sign up\", \"Get Started\", \"Try for Free\", or similar calls to action.\n        3.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links (any links on the page).\n        4.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars (e.g., main navigation, footer navigation).\n*   **Regression Suite:** Not applicable for this smoke test strategy. Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the homepage and its key elements. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains methods to access buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential loading delays. This will reduce flakiness caused by elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Example:** Wait for a maximum of 5 seconds for a button to be present before failing the test.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (`https://europa.eu`):** This is the primary target for element discovery.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage Load Success:** HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Button Presence:** Element is present in the DOM and visible on the page.\n    *   **Link Presence:** Element is present in the DOM and visible on the page.\n    *   **Menu Bar Presence:** Element is present in the DOM and visible on the page."
