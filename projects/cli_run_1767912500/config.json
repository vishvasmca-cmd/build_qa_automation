  "master_plan": "# ParaBank Master Test Strategy\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for ParaBank, a demo banking application, ensuring comprehensive and effective regression testing. This strategy is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite before any automation begins.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nParaBank simulates an online banking platform. Key business functionalities include:\n\n*   **Registration:** Allows new users to create accounts.\n*   **Login:** Authenticates existing users.\n*   **Open Account:** Enables users to create new bank accounts.\n*   **Transfer Funds:** Allows users to move money between accounts.\n*   **Request Loan:** Enables users to apply for loans.\n\n**Business Criticality:** All listed functionalities are crucial for the operation of the simulated bank.\n\n*   **P0 (Critical):** Login, Transfer Funds\n*   **P1 (High):** Open Account, Request Loan, Registration\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nFailure of the ParaBank application could result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect fund transfers, unauthorized access leading to theft.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust if the system is unreliable or insecure.\n*   **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive user information.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities listed in the User Goal (Registration, Login, Open Account, Transfer Funds, Request Loan).\n*   Negative testing of input fields (e.g., invalid characters, exceeding limits).\n*   Boundary value analysis for numerical fields (e.g., transfer amounts, loan amounts).\n*   Error handling and validation message verification.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\n*   Basic security checks (OWASP Top 10 focus).\n*   API testing of core banking functions (if APIs are exposed).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, and endurance).\n*   Detailed security penetration testing.\n*   Full accessibility testing (WCAG compliance).\n*   Integration with external systems beyond the ParaBank environment (e.g., real payment gateways).\n*   Mobile application testing (unless explicitly required).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite provides a minimal \"Health Check\" to ensure the application is functional after deployment or significant changes. If these tests fail, the build is immediately rejected.\n\n*   **Login:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n*   **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads without errors and essential elements are displayed (e.g., account summary).\n*   **Transfer Funds:** Verify that a transfer funds transaction can be initiated.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite provides a comprehensive test coverage of all functionalities to prevent regressions after code changes.\n\n*   **Registration:**\n    *   Successful registration with valid data.\n    *   Error messages for invalid data (e.g., missing fields, invalid email format, password complexity).\n    *   Duplicate username handling.\n*   **Login:**\n    *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n    *   Error messages for invalid username/password combinations.\n    *   Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts (if implemented).\n*   **Open Account:**\n    *   Successful account creation with valid data.\n    *   Error messages for invalid data (e.g., negative initial deposit).\n    *   Verification that new account is displayed in account summary.\n*   **Transfer Funds:**\n    *   Successful transfer between valid accounts.\n    *   Insufficient funds handling.\n    *   Invalid account number handling.\n    *   Transfer amount exceeding limits.\n*   **Request Loan:**\n    *   Successful loan request with valid data.\n    *   Error messages for invalid data (e.g., negative loan amount, invalid down payment).\n    *   Verification of loan application status.\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid inputs for all fields (e.g., special characters, SQL injection attempts, XSS).\n    *   Boundary value analysis (e.g., minimum and maximum amounts for transfers and loans).\n    *   Timeouts (e.g., simulate slow network connections).\n    *   Empty states (e.g., no transactions to display).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users performing the same transaction simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures: Simulate network interruptions during transactions.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks on input fields (SQLi, XSS). Example: Attempt to enter `<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>` into the First Name field during registration.\n    *   Verify secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, account numbers).\n*   **Data Validation:**\n    *  Verify error messages are displayed when submitting an empty form.\n    *  Verify data length and constraints on input fields.\n    *  Verify special characters or invalid formats are not accepted in specific fields.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined user accounts with known balances for basic scenarios.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Programmatically generated data (e.g., random account numbers, loan amounts) for extensive testing and to avoid data collisions.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored securely and managed to prevent data leakage or corruption.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to create reusable and maintainable test code. Each page of the application should be represented as a Page Object, encapsulating the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them. Example: `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, \"transferButton\")))`\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to synchronize test execution with the application's behavior.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Investigate and implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from minor UI changes. Example: If an element locator changes, the framework should attempt to find a similar element based on attributes or text.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Prioritized Exploration)\n\nThe autonomous agent must explore the following pages/flows FIRST:\n\n1.  **Registration Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/register.htm`\n2.  **Login Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm` (Top-right form)\n3.  **Account Summary Page:** (Post-login) - Ensure all account details are visible and accurate.\n4.  **Transfer Funds Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/transfer.htm`\n5.  **Open New Account Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/openaccount.htm`\n6.  **Request Loan Page:** `https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/requestloan.htm`\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n\"Success\" is defined as:\n\n*   **HTTP 200 Status Code:** The page loads without server errors.\n*   **Expected Elements Visible:** Key elements (e.g., buttons, forms, labels) are present and visible.\n*   **Correct Page Title:** The page title matches the expected value.\n*   **Functional Links:** Links navigate to the correct pages.\n*   **No JavaScript Errors:** The browser console is free of JavaScript errors.\n*   **Successful Transactions:** Transactions (e.g., fund transfers, loan requests) are processed successfully and reflected in the account summary.\n*   **Appropriate Error Messages:** When invalid data is entered, clear and informative error messages are displayed.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing ParaBank.  Adherence to this plan will result in a high-quality, stable, and reliable application."
