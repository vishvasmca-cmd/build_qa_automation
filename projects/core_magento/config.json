  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for the Magento e-commerce site, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type (smoke). This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Smoke Testing\n\n**Application Under Test (AUT):** `https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/`\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** E-commerce platforms are highly sensitive to downtime and defects. Core functionality like search and product viewing directly impacts revenue.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure in search or product details can lead to immediate loss of sales, customer dissatisfaction, and damage to brand reputation. A faulty filter can lead to a user not finding the desired product, and thus not making a purchase.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Search functionality for the term \"Watch\".\n        *   Filtering search results by category.\n        *   Viewing product details page after filtering.\n        *   Basic page load and rendering.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   User registration/login.\n        *   Shopping cart and checkout process.\n        *   Payment gateway integration.\n        *   All other product categories besides \"Watch\".\n        *   Advanced search features (autocomplete, suggestions).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Accessibility testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the core search and product viewing functionality is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage.\n        2.  Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar and submit.\n        3.  Verify search results page loads.\n        4.  Filter search results by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\").\n        5.  Verify filtered results are displayed.\n        6.  Click on a product from the filtered results.\n        7.  Verify the product details page loads correctly.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy, but included for future expansion)\n    *   **Goal:** Ensure that changes to the system do not negatively impact existing functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases:** (Examples for future regression testing)\n        *   Search for \"Watch\" with different variations (e.g., \"watch\", \"Watches\").\n        *   Filter by multiple categories.\n        *   Verify product image loading.\n        *   Verify product description is displayed.\n        *   Verify related products are displayed.\n        *   Verify product reviews are displayed.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** For the smoke test, we can use static data. The term \"Watch\" is expected to return results. We should identify a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\") that is guaranteed to have watches.\n    *   **Dynamic Generation:** For future regression tests, consider using dynamic data generation for product names, categories, etc., to avoid test failures due to data changes.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page (Homepage, Search Results Page, Product Details Page) as a separate class. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Example Page Objects:**\n        *   `HomePage`: Contains methods for interacting with the search bar.\n        *   `SearchResultsPage`: Contains methods for filtering results and selecting a product.\n        *   `ProductDetailsPage`: Contains methods for verifying product details.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous loading of elements. This prevents false failures due to timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits for elements to be visible or clickable before interacting with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** (Advanced) Consider implementing basic self-healing mechanisms, such as retrying element interactions if they fail due to transient issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Focus on the search bar element (`input[name='q']`).\n    2.  **Search Results Page:** Focus on the category filter elements (e.g., `a[href*='category=mens-watches']`).\n    3.  **Product Details Page:** Focus on elements displaying product name, image, and description.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code.\n        *   Search bar element is present and enabled.\n    *   **Search Results Page:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code.\n        *   Search results are displayed.\n        *   Category filter is present and functional.\n        *   The number of results displayed is reasonable (not zero).\n    *   **Product Details Page:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code.\n        *   Product name is displayed.\n        *   Product image is displayed.\n        *   Product description is displayed.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots or videos for failed test cases to aid in debugging.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust smoke testing suite for the Magento e-commerce platform. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and new features are added."
