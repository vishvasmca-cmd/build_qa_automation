This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/)\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Focus:** Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nThe target application is an e-commerce platform. In this domain, core functionalities like product search, filtering, and viewing product details are crucial for user engagement and driving sales. Any failure in these areas can directly impact revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n*   **Financial Loss:** Failure in product search or display can lead to lost sales opportunities.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Poor user experience due to broken functionality can damage the brand's reputation.\n*   **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Inability to find desired products can lead to frustration and abandonment of the site.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Functionality related to searching for products using keywords.\n    *   Filtering search results by category.\n    *   Displaying product details page.\n    *   Basic navigation through the website.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   User account management (login, registration, password reset).\n    *   Shopping cart and checkout process.\n    *   Payment gateway integration.\n    *   Order management.\n    *   Backend administrative functions.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n    *   Accessibility testing.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will serve as a \"health check\" to ensure the core functionality related to product discovery is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully.\n    2.  **Search Functionality:**\n        *   Search for the keyword \"Watch\".\n        *   Verify that search results are displayed.\n    3.  **Category Filter:**\n        *   Filter the search results by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's Watches\").\n        *   Verify that the results are filtered correctly.\n    4.  **Product Details Page:**\n        *   Click on a product from the filtered search results.\n        *   Verify that the product details page loads successfully.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After every build deployment to any environment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All tests in the Smoke Suite must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Limited - Focused on Search)\n\nSince this is a smoke test strategy, the regression suite will be limited to the search functionality.  A full regression suite would be defined in a separate, more comprehensive testing strategy.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Search with No Results:** Search for a non-existent product (e.g., \"Unicorn Watch\"). Verify that a \"No results found\" message is displayed.\n    2.  **Search Autocomplete:** Verify search autocomplete/suggestions appear as the user types \"Watch\".\n    3.  **Category Filter - No Results:** Filter by a category that should return no results for \"Watch\". Verify that a \"No results found\" message is displayed.\n    4.  **Navigation from Product Page:** Navigate back to the search results page from the product details page.\n    5.  **Verify Product Image Loads:** Ensure the product image loads correctly on the product details page.\n    6.  **Verify Product Name:** Ensure the product name is displayed correctly on the product details page.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After any code changes related to search, product catalog, or UI elements on the product details page.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:**  A high percentage (e.g., 95%) of tests in the Regression Suite must pass. Failures should be investigated and addressed promptly.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** For smoke tests, use predefined search terms (\"Watch\") and category filters (\"Men's Watches\") that are known to exist in the product catalog.\n*   **Dynamic Data (Limited):** For the \"Search with No Results\" test case, use a dynamically generated or hardcoded string that is highly unlikely to exist as a product name.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page or section of the application as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Example: `HomePage`, `SearchResultsPage`, `ProductDetailsPage`.\n*   **Test Framework:**  Choose a suitable test framework (e.g., Selenium with JUnit/TestNG for Java, or Playwright/Cypress for JavaScript).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium or similar mechanisms in other frameworks) to handle asynchronous loading of elements. This will reduce flakiness caused by timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to wait for specific elements to be present or visible before interacting with them.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for tests that are prone to flakiness due to network issues or environment instability.  Limit retries to a reasonable number (e.g., 2-3).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Initial Focus)\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:**  Ensure the basic structure and key elements are present.\n2.  **Search Input Field:**  Focus on the search input field and its behavior.\n3.  **Search Results Page:**  Analyze the layout, filtering options, and product listings.\n4.  **Product Details Page:**  Examine the product information, images, and related elements.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Page Load:** HTTP status code 200.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Key elements (e.g., search input, product images, product titles, filter options) are visible on the page.\n*   **Text Verification:** Specific text elements (e.g., \"Welcome\", \"No results found\") are present and accurate.\n*   **Functional Verification:** Search returns relevant results, filters are applied correctly, and product details are displayed accurately.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust testing framework for the Magento e-commerce application. It focuses on the critical functionality of product search and discovery, ensuring a positive user experience and minimizing the risk of revenue loss. Remember that this is a living document and should be updated as the application evolves and new requirements emerge."
