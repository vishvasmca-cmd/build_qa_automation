  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for the Magento e-commerce application, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce Platform\n**Target URL:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type Focus:** Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe target application is an e-commerce platform built on Magento. In the e-commerce domain, core functionalities like product search, filtering, and product detail viewing are critical for user engagement and driving sales. Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Defects in product search or filtering can lead to users not finding desired products, resulting in lost sales.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** A broken or unreliable search experience can frustrate users and damage the brand's reputation.\n*   **Data Integrity (Low):** While data integrity is important, the initial smoke test focuses on functionality, not data validation.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope (Smoke Test Focus):**\n\n*   Successful search for a product (\"Watch\").\n*   Filtering search results by category.\n*   Viewing product details page after filtering.\n*   Basic page load and rendering of key elements.\n\n**Out of Scope (For Regression/Future Phases):**\n\n*   Negative search scenarios (e.g., searching for non-existent products).\n*   Advanced filtering options (e.g., price range, color).\n*   Add to cart functionality.\n*   Checkout process.\n*   User authentication.\n*   Performance testing.\n*   Security testing.\n*   Responsiveness testing (different screen sizes).\n*   Accessibility testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of a minimal set of tests to verify the core functionality related to product search, filtering, and viewing product details.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Successful Product Search**\n    *   Navigate to the homepage.\n    *   Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar.\n    *   Verify that search results are displayed.\n*   **Test Case 2: Filter Search Results by Category**\n    *   Perform a search for \"Watch\" (as in Test Case 1).\n    *   Select a category filter (e.g., \"Men's Watches\").\n    *   Verify that the search results are filtered correctly.\n*   **Test Case 3: View Product Details**\n    *   Perform a search for \"Watch\" and filter by category (as in Test Case 2).\n    *   Click on a product from the filtered search results.\n    *   Verify that the product details page loads correctly.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Future - High Level)\n\nThe regression suite will expand upon the smoke tests to cover a wider range of scenarios and edge cases. This will be defined in a separate document.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nFor the smoke tests, a simple data strategy is sufficient.\n\n*   **Static Data:** Use predefined search terms (\"Watch\") and category filters (\"Men's Watches\") that are known to exist in the product catalog.\n*   **No Data Creation/Modification:** The smoke tests will not involve creating or modifying any data.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page or section of the application as a separate class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Example: `HomePage.java`, `SearchResultsPage.java`, `ProductDetailsPage.java`\n*   **Language:** Java or Python are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n*   **Test Framework:** JUnit or pytest.\n*   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ or Hamcrest.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Awaitility) to handle asynchronous loading of elements. This will reduce flakiness caused by timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Focus on the search bar element and its functionality.\n2.  **Search Results Page:** Focus on the category filter elements and the display of search results.\n3.  **Product Details Page:** Focus on the loading of product information (name, price, description).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Search:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for the search results page.\n    *   Presence of search results (at least one product displayed).\n    *   The search term (\"Watch\") is highlighted or displayed prominently on the search results page.\n*   **Successful Filtering:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for the filtered search results page.\n    *   The selected category filter is displayed on the page.\n    *   The search results only contain products from the selected category.\n*   **Successful Product Details Page Load:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code for the product details page.\n    *   The product name, price, and description are displayed correctly.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the Magento e-commerce application, focusing on the critical user goal of searching, filtering, and viewing product details. This document will be reviewed and updated as the project progresses and new requirements emerge."
