  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Magento, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce Platform\n**Target URL:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** E-commerce platforms are revenue-critical. Failures directly impact sales, customer satisfaction, and brand reputation. The search and product detail pages are key components of the customer journey.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Loss of revenue due to inability to find or view products.\n    *   **Medium:** Damage to brand reputation due to poor user experience.\n    *   **Low:** Data breach (assuming standard security measures are in place and not directly related to this specific test).\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Searching for a product (\"Watch\").\n        *   Filtering search results by category.\n        *   Viewing product details page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Authentication (Login/Registration).\n        *   Shopping Cart functionality.\n        *   Checkout and Payment processing.\n        *   Admin panel functionality.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic input validation).\n        *   Responsiveness testing (different screen sizes).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a **Smoke Test** approach, verifying the core functionality of product search and viewing product details.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Product Search and View**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/).\n        2.  Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar and submit.\n        3.  Verify that search results are displayed.\n        4.  Filter the search results by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\").\n        5.  Verify that the search results are filtered correctly.\n        6.  Click on a product from the filtered results.\n        7.  Verify that the product details page loads successfully.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Limited - for Smoke Context):**\n    *   **Test Case 2: No Search Results**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/).\n        2.  Enter a non-existent product in the search bar (e.g., \"Unicorn\").\n        3.  Verify that a \"No results found\" message is displayed.\n    *   **Test Case 3: Invalid Filter**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/).\n        2.  Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar and submit.\n        3.  Attempt to filter by an invalid category (e.g., a category that doesn't exist).\n        4.  Verify that the filter is not applied or an appropriate error message is displayed.\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** The search term \"Watch\" is considered static data for this smoke test.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** The category used for filtering should be dynamically retrieved from the available categories on the search results page. This ensures the test remains valid even if categories change.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent the key pages involved in the test:\n        *   `HomePage`:  Contains elements and methods related to the homepage (e.g., search bar).\n        *   `SearchResultsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the search results page (e.g., filter options, product listings).\n        *   `ProductDetailsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the product details page (e.g., product name, price, description).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to handle potential delays in page loading or element rendering. This helps reduce flakiness.  Example:  `waitForElementVisible(ProductDetailsPage.productName, timeout=10)`\n    *   **Explicit Waits:**  Use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing (Consider for future expansion):**  Implement basic self-healing mechanisms, such as re-locating elements if they are not found using the initial locator.  This is more complex and should be considered after the initial framework is stable.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage Search Bar:** Focus on the search bar element and its functionality.\n    2.  **Search Results Page:**  Explore the filter options and product listings on the search results page.\n    3.  **Product Details Page:**  Examine the elements and content on the product details page.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Successful Search:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for the search results page.\n        *   Presence of product listings related to the search term \"Watch\".\n        *   The number of search results displayed is greater than zero (unless searching for a non-existent product).\n    *   **Successful Filtering:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code after applying the filter.\n        *   Product listings are updated to reflect the selected filter category.\n    *   **Successful Product Details Page Load:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for the product details page.\n        *   Presence of key product details (e.g., product name, price, image).\n        *   The product name on the details page matches the product selected from the search results.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the specified functionality of the Magento E-commerce application. It prioritizes critical areas, defines a focused scope, and provides architectural guidance for building a robust and resilient test automation framework. Remember that this is a living document and should be updated as the application evolves and testing needs change."
