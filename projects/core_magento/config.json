  "master_plan": "Okay, I will craft a Master Test Strategy document tailored for the Magento e-commerce platform, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document will provide a clear roadmap for the engineering team.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Platform\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nThe target application is an e-commerce platform built on Magento. In the e-commerce domain, core functionalities like product search, filtering, and product detail viewing are crucial for user engagement and driving sales. Any failure in these areas can directly impact revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nA failure in the specified user goal (searching for a product, filtering, and viewing details) carries the following risks:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Customers cannot find and view products, leading to lost sales opportunities.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Poor user experience due to broken functionality can damage the brand's reputation.\n*   **Decreased User Engagement:** Frustrated users may abandon the site and switch to competitors.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Successful product search using the search bar.\n    *   Filtering search results by category.\n    *   Viewing product details page after filtering.\n    *   Basic UI elements on the product details page (e.g., product name, price, image).\n\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Adding to cart, checkout, and payment processes (covered in separate test strategies).\n    *   User registration and login.\n    *   Advanced search functionalities (e.g., auto-suggestions, spell correction).\n    *   Performance testing (load times, scalability).\n    *   Security testing (vulnerability scanning, penetration testing).\n    *   Responsive testing (mobile, tablet).\n    *   Accessibility testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will focus on verifying the core functionality of product search, filtering, and viewing product details.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Product Search and View**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a user can successfully search for \"Watch,\" filter the results by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\"), and view the details page of a product from the filtered results.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/).\n        2.  Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar and submit.\n        3.  On the search results page, filter by a category (e.g., \"Men's\").\n        4.  Click on a product from the filtered results.\n        5.  Verify that the product details page loads correctly.\n    *   **Expected Result:** The product details page should load with the product name, price, image, and other relevant information.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\nWhile the primary focus is smoke testing, a minimal regression check is included to ensure basic stability.\n\n*   **Regression Test Case 1: No Search Results**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that searching for a non-existent product displays an appropriate \"No results found\" message.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/).\n        2.  Enter a non-existent product name (e.g., \"xyz123\") in the search bar and submit.\n        3.  Verify that a \"No results found\" message is displayed.\n    *   **Expected Result:** A \"No results found\" message should be displayed on the search results page.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:**\n    *   **Search Term:** \"Watch\" (This is a known product category).\n    *   **Category Filter:** \"Men's\" (This is a known product category).\n    *   **Non-Existent Product:** \"xyz123\" (This should not exist in the catalog).\n*   **Data Handling:** Static test data will be used for the smoke tests. This data is readily available and does not require dynamic generation.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Example:\n        *   `HomePage`: Represents the homepage, including the search bar.\n        *   `SearchResultsPage`: Represents the search results page, including filtering options.\n        *   `ProductDetailsPage`: Represents the product details page.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential delays in page loading or element rendering. This will reduce flakiness caused by timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/):** Focus on identifying the search bar element.\n2.  **Search Results Page:** Focus on identifying category filters and product listings.\n3.  **Product Details Page:** Focus on identifying product name, price, image, and other relevant information.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** All pages should return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Key elements (search bar, product listings, product details) should be visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that the product name on the product details page matches the product selected from the search results.\n    *   **\"No results found\" Message:** When searching for a non-existent product, the \"No results found\" message should be displayed.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for testing the specified functionality of the Magento e-commerce platform. It will guide the engineering team in developing and executing effective tests to ensure the quality and stability of the application."
