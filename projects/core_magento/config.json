  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for the Magento e-commerce application, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce Platform\n**Target URL:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe target application is an e-commerce platform.  In this domain, core functionality such as product search, filtering, and product detail viewing are critical for user engagement and driving sales.  Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:**  Defects preventing users from finding or viewing products directly translate to lost sales opportunities.\n*   **Reputational Damage:**  A buggy or unusable product catalog can lead to negative reviews and loss of customer trust.\n*   **Decreased User Engagement:**  Poor search and filtering experiences can frustrate users and drive them to competitors.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Product Search functionality\n    *   Category Filtering\n    *   Product Detail Page display\n    *   Basic UI elements related to search, filter, and product viewing.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Shopping cart functionality\n    *   Checkout process\n    *   User account management\n    *   Payment processing\n    *   Backend administrative functions\n    *   Performance testing\n    *   Security testing\n    *   Accessibility testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\nGiven the request for a *smoke* test strategy, the focus is on verifying the core functionality is operational.\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the following test case, directly addressing the user goal:\n\n1.  **Search, Filter, and View Product Details:**\n    *   Navigate to the homepage.\n    *   Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar and submit.\n    *   Verify search results are displayed.\n    *   Filter the search results by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\").\n    *   Verify the filtered results are displayed.\n    *   Click on a product from the filtered results.\n    *   Verify the product details page loads successfully.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Limited - for Smoke Context)\n\nWhile this is a smoke test strategy, a *minimal* regression check is included to ensure basic stability of related components.  This is NOT a full regression suite.\n\n1.  **Empty Search:**\n    *   Navigate to the homepage.\n    *   Submit an empty search query.\n    *   Verify an appropriate message is displayed (e.g., \"Please enter a search keyword or phrase.\").\n2.  **Invalid Search:**\n    *   Navigate to the homepage.\n    *   Enter a non-existent product in the search bar (e.g., \"xyz123\").\n    *   Verify an appropriate \"No results found\" message is displayed.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** For the smoke tests, use a known, existing product name (\"Watch\") and a valid category name (\"Men's\"). These values should be stored as configuration parameters.\n*   **Data Maintenance:** Periodically review and update the static data to reflect changes in the product catalog.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent the web pages and their elements. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   `HomePage`:  Contains elements and methods related to the homepage (e.g., search bar, search button).\n    *   `SearchResultsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the search results page (e.g., search results list, filter options).\n    *   `ProductDetailsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the product details page (e.g., product name, product description).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to load or become visible, especially after filtering or navigating to a new page.  This helps mitigate timing issues and flakiness.\n*   **Explicit Waits:**  Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests (e.g., retry a test 1-2 times if it fails due to a transient issue).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Focus on the search bar and its immediate surroundings.\n2.  **Search Results Page:** Explore the filter options (category, price, etc.) and the pagination.\n3.  **Product Details Page:**  Verify the product name, description, price, and image are displayed correctly.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Search:**  The search results page loads with relevant products displayed.\n*   **Successful Filtering:** The filtered results page loads with products matching the selected filter criteria.\n*   **Product Details Page Load:** The product details page loads successfully, displaying the product information.\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Verify that key elements (e.g., search results, filter options, product details) are visible on the page.\n*   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text elements (e.g., product name, price) match the expected values.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the core functionality of the Magento e-commerce application. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical areas to ensure a stable and reliable user experience."
