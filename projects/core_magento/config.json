  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Magento, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Platform\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** E-commerce platform. Core business functions revolve around product discovery, purchase, and order fulfillment. Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High:** Loss of revenue due to inability to purchase products.\n    *   **Medium:** Damage to brand reputation due to poor user experience.\n    *   **Low:** Minor cosmetic defects.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Search functionality.\n        *   Product catalog browsing and filtering.\n        *   Product detail page.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   User account management (registration, login, profile).\n        *   Shopping cart and checkout process (covered in separate regression suites).\n        *   Backend admin panel.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).\n        *   Third-party integrations (payment gateways, shipping providers).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a **Smoke Test** to validate the core functionality of product search and viewing product details.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify that the core product search and viewing functionality is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Search for \"Watch\":** Navigate to the homepage, enter \"Watch\" in the search bar, and verify that search results are displayed.\n        2.  **Filter by Category:** From the search results page, filter the results by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\"). Verify that the results are filtered correctly.\n        3.  **View Product Details:** Click on a product from the filtered search results. Verify that the product details page loads correctly.\n*   **Regression Suite (Not applicable for this specific request, but included for completeness):**\n    *   **Objective:** Ensure that changes to the system do not negatively impact existing functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases (Examples):**\n        *   Search for products with special characters.\n        *   Verify pagination on search results pages.\n        *   Verify product image loading.\n        *   Verify product reviews display correctly.\n        *   Test different filter combinations.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** For the smoke test, use pre-defined search terms (\"Watch\") and category filters (\"Men's\"). This ensures consistency and repeatability.\n    *   **Dynamic Data (Future):** For regression testing, consider using dynamic data generation to cover a wider range of scenarios (e.g., random product names, different price ranges).\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication.\n        *   Create Page Objects for:\n            *   Homepage\n            *   Search Results Page\n            *   Product Details Page\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) to handle asynchronous loading of elements.\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to handle dynamic content loading.\n        *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI to identify elements based on multiple attributes) to mitigate issues caused by minor UI changes.\n    *   **Error Handling:**\n        *   Implement robust error handling in the test framework to catch exceptions and log detailed error messages.\n        *   Use screenshots and video recordings to capture the state of the application when errors occur.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Focus on the search bar element.\n    2.  **Search Results Page:** Focus on the product listings, filter options (category), and pagination.\n    3.  **Product Details Page:** Focus on product name, image, price, description, and add-to-cart button.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Search Functionality:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for the search results page.\n        *   Verify that the search results page displays products related to the search term (\"Watch\").\n        *   Verify that the number of search results is greater than zero (if applicable).\n    *   **Filter Functionality:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for the filtered search results page.\n        *   Verify that the filtered search results only display products within the selected category (\"Men's\").\n    *   **Product Details Page:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for the product details page.\n        *   Verify that the product name, image, price, and description are displayed correctly.\n        *   Verify that the \"Add to Cart\" button is present and enabled.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate clear and concise test reports that include:\n        *   Test case execution status (pass/fail).\n        *   Error messages (if any).\n        *   Screenshots and video recordings (if applicable).\n        *   Execution time.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing the Magento E-commerce platform, specifically focusing on the defined user goal and testing type. It will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle."
