  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for Magento, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** This is an E-commerce platform. The core business revolves around product discovery and sales. Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High Risk:** Checkout failures, inability to add products to cart, security vulnerabilities (e.g., payment data breaches).\n    *   **Medium Risk:** Product search failures, incorrect product information, broken navigation.\n    *   **Low Risk:** Minor UI glitches, less frequently used features.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Product Search functionality.\n        *   Product Catalog browsing and filtering.\n        *   Product Detail Page.\n        *   Core UI elements related to search and product display.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   User account management (registration, login, profile).\n        *   Shopping cart and checkout process (covered in separate, more comprehensive testing).\n        *   Admin panel functionality.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing (beyond basic input validation).\n        *   Third-party integrations (e.g., payment gateways, shipping providers) - stubbed or mocked for this phase.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nGiven the request for a *smoke* test strategy, we will focus on the core happy path to ensure the system is fundamentally operational.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the basic health of the application, specifically the search and product viewing functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Search for \"Watch\":**\n            *   Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar.\n            *   Verify search results are displayed.\n        3.  **Filter by Category:**\n            *   Apply a category filter (e.g., \"Men's\").\n            *   Verify the search results are filtered correctly.\n        4.  **View Product Details:**\n            *   Click on a product from the filtered search results.\n            *   Verify the product details page loads successfully.\n*   **Regression Suite (Future Expansion):**\n    *   *Note:* While this is a smoke test strategy, outlining the regression strategy helps plan for future test automation.\n    *   **Objective:** Ensure that new changes do not break existing search and product catalog functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases (Examples):**\n        *   Search with different keywords (e.g., \"Shirt\", \"Shoes\").\n        *   Search with special characters or numbers.\n        *   Filter by multiple categories.\n        *   Sort products by price, name, etc.\n        *   Verify product image loading.\n        *   Verify product description display.\n        *   Verify related products section (if present).\n        *   Verify product reviews section (if present).\n        *   Verify \"Add to Wishlist\" functionality (if present).\n        *   Verify \"Add to Compare\" functionality (if present).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** For smoke tests, use static, pre-defined data (e.g., known product names, categories). This ensures consistency and repeatability.\n    *   **Dynamic Generation (Future):** For regression tests, consider dynamic data generation to cover a wider range of scenarios. This could involve using Faker libraries or database seeding.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** This is a must.  Each page (Homepage, Search Results Page, Product Details Page) should have its own Page Object.\n    *   **Benefits:**\n        *   Improved code maintainability.\n        *   Reduced code duplication.\n        *   Increased test readability.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains methods for interacting with the homepage (e.g., `enterSearchTerm()`, `clickSearchButton()`).\n        *   `SearchResultsPage.java`: Contains methods for interacting with the search results page (e.g., `applyCategoryFilter()`, `getProductTitles()`).\n        *   `ProductDetailsPage.java`: Contains methods for interacting with the product details page (e.g., `getProductTitle()`, `getProductDescription()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:** E-commerce sites are dynamic. Elements may load slowly or intermittently.\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits (e.g., `WebDriverWait`) to wait for elements to be present and interactable before attempting to interact with them.  Avoid implicit waits.\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (retry logic) to verify conditions that may take time to become true (e.g., checking if a product image has loaded).\n        *   **Self-Healing (Advanced):** Implement a mechanism to automatically locate elements using alternative locators if the primary locator fails.  This requires careful design and maintenance.\n    *   **Example (Polling Assertion):**\n\n```java\npublic boolean isImageLoaded(WebElement imageElement) {\n    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));\n    return wait.until(d -> ((JavascriptExecutor) d).executeScript(\"return arguments[0].complete && typeof arguments[0].naturalWidth != \\\"undefined\\\" && arguments[0].naturalWidth > 0\", imageElement).equals(true));\n}\n```\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Order of Exploration):**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Start by exploring the homepage to identify the search bar and any prominent product categories.\n    2.  **Search Results Page:** After performing a search, focus on the search results page to understand how products are displayed, filtered, and sorted.\n    3.  **Product Details Page:** Explore the product details page to identify key information such as product title, description, price, and images.\n*   **Verification Criteria (What Defines \"Success\"?):**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that all page requests return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that key elements (e.g., search bar, product titles, product images) are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text (e.g., product title, category name) is displayed correctly.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   **Homepage Load:** HTTP 200 AND Search bar is visible.\n        *   **Search Results:** HTTP 200 AND At least one product title contains the search term \"Watch\".\n        *   **Product Details:** HTTP 200 AND Product title is visible AND Product description is visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing the Magento E-commerce application. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and new requirements emerge. Good luck!"
