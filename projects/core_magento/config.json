  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for the Magento e-commerce application, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce Platform\n**Target URL:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe application is an E-commerce platform built on Magento.  The core business function is online retail, enabling customers to browse, select, and purchase products.  Given the \"Search, Filter, View Product\" user goal, the Product Catalog functionality is critical.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the Product Catalog functionality (search, filtering, product details) directly impacts revenue generation and customer satisfaction.  Specifically:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to find and view products leads to lost sales.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Poor user experience due to broken search/filtering can damage brand reputation.\n*   **Customer Churn:** Frustrated customers may abandon the site and switch to competitors.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Search functionality for the term \"Watch\".\n    *   Filtering of search results by product category.\n    *   Display of product details page for a selected \"Watch\".\n    *   Basic UI elements related to search, filtering, and product display.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Authentication (Login/Registration).\n    *   Shopping Cart and Checkout process.\n    *   Payment processing.\n    *   Advanced search features (e.g., auto-suggestions, stemming).\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n    *   Responsiveness testing (mobile devices).\n    *   Accessibility testing.\n    *   All negative testing scenarios.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will focus on verifying the core functionality required to achieve the user goal: searching for a product, filtering the results, and viewing the product details.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Search and View Product Details**\n    1.  Navigate to the Magento homepage.\n    2.  Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar and submit.\n    3.  Verify that search results are displayed.\n    4.  Click on a \"Watch\" product from the search results.\n    5.  Verify that the product details page loads successfully.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\nSince the testing type is Smoke, the Regression Suite is not applicable in this context. However, for future regression testing, the following considerations would apply:\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**  A full regression suite would expand on the smoke tests to cover:\n    *   Different search terms (e.g., \"Shirt\", \"Pants\").\n    *   Filtering by different categories (e.g., Price, Color, Brand).\n    *   Sorting of search results (e.g., Price Low to High, Newest).\n    *   Edge cases: Searching for special characters, very long strings.\n    *   Product detail page variations: different product types (simple, configurable, downloadable).\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility.\n    *   Error handling: What happens if a product is not found?\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nFor the Smoke test, a static data approach is sufficient. We assume that there is at least one \"Watch\" product available in the catalog.  If the test environment is frequently refreshed, a simple script to ensure a \"Watch\" product exists might be necessary.\n\n*   **Static Data:**  Rely on pre-existing \"Watch\" products in the test environment.\n*   **Data Maintenance:**  If necessary, a script will be created to ensure a \"Watch\" product exists before running the smoke tests.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nA Page Object Model (POM) structure is highly recommended for maintainability and scalability.\n\n*   **Page Objects:**\n    *   `HomePage`: Represents the Magento homepage, including the search bar.\n    *   `SearchResultsPage`: Represents the search results page, including filtering options and product listings.\n    *   `ProductDetailsPage`: Represents the product details page.\n*   **Test Cases:**  Test cases should interact with the application through the Page Objects.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\nFlakiness can be a challenge in UI tests.  The following strategies should be implemented:\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) instead of immediate assertions to account for loading times.\n*   **Explicit Waits:**  Use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met (e.g., element to be clickable) before interacting with elements.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:**  Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for network-related issues.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Consider implementing basic self-healing capabilities (e.g., automatically re-locating elements if they are not found).  This is more advanced and may not be necessary for the initial smoke tests.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Focus on the search bar element (`input[name='q']`).\n2.  **Search Results Page:** Focus on product listings (`.products.list .product-item`) and category filters (`.filter-options-item`).\n3.  **Product Details Page:** Focus on product title (`.page-title-wrapper`), price (`.price`), and add-to-cart button (if present).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\nSuccess is defined as:\n\n*   **Homepage:**  The homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code) and the search bar is visible.\n*   **Search Results Page:** The search results page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code), and at least one product is displayed in the search results.\n*   **Product Details Page:** The product details page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code), and the product title is visible and contains the word \"Watch\".\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the core functionality of the Magento E-commerce application. It prioritizes risk mitigation and ensures that the critical \"Search, Filter, View Product\" user goal is thoroughly tested."
