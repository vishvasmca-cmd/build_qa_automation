  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Magento, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce Platform\n**Target URL:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe application is an E-commerce platform built on Magento.  The core business function is online retail, enabling customers to browse, select, and purchase products.  Given the \"Search, Filter, View Product\" user goal, the Product Catalog functionality is critical.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure in the specified user flow (Search, Filter, View Product) can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability for customers to find and view products directly impacts sales.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Poor user experience due to broken search or filtering can lead to customer dissatisfaction and negative reviews.\n*   **Lost Customer Trust:** Unreliable product information or inability to access product details erodes customer confidence.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Searching for products using the search bar.\n    *   Filtering search results by category.\n    *   Viewing product details page.\n    *   Basic page load and rendering of key elements.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   User registration and login.\n    *   Shopping cart and checkout process.\n    *   Payment gateway integration.\n    *   Order management.\n    *   All negative testing scenarios.\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n    *   Responsiveness testing (different screen sizes).\n    *   Accessibility testing.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will focus on verifying the core functionality of the specified user flow.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Search for Product**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a user can successfully search for a product using the search bar.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/).\n        2.  Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar.\n        3.  Press Enter or click the search icon.\n        4.  Verify that search results are displayed.\n*   **Test Case 2: Filter Search Results**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a user can filter the search results by category.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Perform the \"Search for Product\" test case.\n        2.  On the search results page, locate the category filter (e.g., \"Category\").\n        3.  Select a category (e.g., \"Men\").\n        4.  Verify that the search results are filtered based on the selected category.\n*   **Test Case 3: View Product Details**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that a user can view the details of a product from the search results.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Perform the \"Filter Search Results\" test case.\n        2.  Click on a product in the filtered search results.\n        3.  Verify that the product details page is displayed.\n        4.  Verify that key elements (product name, price, image) are loaded.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*N/A - This is a Smoke Test Strategy.  Regression testing will be defined in a separate document.*\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Static Data:** For the smoke tests, we will use static data. The search term \"Watch\" is pre-defined. The category \"Men\" is also pre-defined. This ensures consistency and repeatability.\n*   **Data Management:** No database manipulation is required for these smoke tests.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   Create separate page objects for:\n        *   `HomePage`: Contains elements and methods related to the homepage (e.g., search bar).\n        *   `SearchResultsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the search results page (e.g., filter options, product listings).\n        *   `ProductDetailsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the product details page (e.g., product name, price, image).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Implement polling assertions (e.g., using WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle potential delays in page loading or element rendering. This will reduce flakiness caused by timing issues.  Poll for a maximum of 5 seconds, with a poll interval of 500ms.\n*   **Element Existence Checks:** Before interacting with an element, verify that it exists and is visible on the page. This prevents errors caused by elements not being fully loaded.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for critical actions (e.g., clicking a button) in case of intermittent failures.  Retry a maximum of 2 times, with a 1-second delay between retries.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Focus on the search bar functionality.\n2.  **Search Results Page:** Focus on the category filter and product listings.\n3.  **Product Details Page:** Focus on the product name, price, image, and description.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** All pages should return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Key elements (search bar, filter options, product listings, product details) should be visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that the product name, price, and other relevant text are displayed correctly on the product details page.\n    *   **Search Results:** Verify that the search results are relevant to the search term (\"Watch\").\n    *   **Filtering:** Verify that the search results are filtered correctly based on the selected category (\"Men\").\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP status codes other than 200.\n    *   Exceptions or errors during page loading or element interaction.\n    *   Incorrect or missing data.\n    *   Unexpected page behavior.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the specified user flow in the Magento E-commerce application. It emphasizes risk assessment, a well-defined testing scope, and architectural guidance to ensure a robust and maintainable testing process."
