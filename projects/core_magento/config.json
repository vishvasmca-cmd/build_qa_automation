  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Magento, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-Commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** This is an E-commerce platform. The core business function is enabling users to find and purchase products. Failure in key areas like search, product display, or checkout directly impacts revenue.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Bugs preventing product discovery or purchase completion lead to immediate revenue loss.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Poor search results or broken product pages erode customer trust and brand image.\n    *   **Data Security:** While not the primary focus of this smoke test, any vulnerability exposed during testing must be addressed immediately.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Homepage\n        *   Search functionality\n        *   Product listing pages (category filtered)\n        *   Product detail pages\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   User registration/login\n        *   Shopping cart\n        *   Checkout process\n        *   Payment gateways\n        *   Admin panel\n        *   All other modules not directly related to the specified user goal.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a **Smoke Test** to validate the core functionality of searching, filtering, and viewing product details.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Search and View Product**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage (`https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/`).\n        2.  Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar and submit.\n        3.  Verify that search results are displayed.\n        4.  Filter the search results by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\").\n        5.  Verify that the product listing is updated based on the filter.\n        6.  Click on a product from the filtered list.\n        7.  Verify that the product details page loads correctly.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not executed during Smoke, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   **Search Functionality:**\n        *   Search with different keywords (e.g., \"Shirt\", \"Pants\").\n        *   Search with special characters.\n        *   Search with empty string.\n    *   **Filtering:**\n        *   Filter by multiple categories.\n        *   Filter by price range.\n        *   Clear filters and verify the product listing resets.\n    *   **Product Details Page:**\n        *   Verify product name, price, and description are displayed correctly.\n        *   Verify product images are loading.\n        *   Verify related products are displayed (if applicable).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For this smoke test, static data is sufficient. We assume that the product catalog contains at least one \"Watch\" and that the category \"Men's\" exists.\n    *   For future regression tests, a more dynamic data strategy will be needed, potentially involving database seeding or API calls to create test products and categories.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create separate page objects for:\n            *   Homepage\n            *   Search Results Page\n            *   Product Details Page\n    *   **Language:** Python or Java are good choices due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n    *   **Test Runner:** Pytest (Python) or JUnit (Java)\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `wait_until` or similar) to handle asynchronous loading of elements. This is especially important for product images and dynamic content.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. This could involve retrying a test a few times before marking it as failed.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Focus on the search bar element (`<input type=\"text\" id=\"search\">` or similar).\n    2.  **Search Results Page:** Target the product listing container and the category filter elements.\n    3.  **Product Details Page:** Target the product name, price, description, and image elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code.\n        *   Search bar is visible and enabled.\n    *   **Search Results Page:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code.\n        *   Search results are displayed (at least one product should be visible).\n        *   Category filter options are displayed.\n        *   The number of products displayed matches the filter criteria.\n    *   **Product Details Page:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code.\n        *   Product name, price, and description are visible.\n        *   Product image is loaded.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate clear and concise test reports indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots or videos of failed tests to aid in debugging.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing the core functionality of the Magento E-commerce application. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and new features are added."

  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: E-Commerce Application - Magento Software Testing Board\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Magento Software Testing Board e-commerce application. It provides a comprehensive plan for ensuring the quality and reliability of the platform, focusing initially on smoke testing before expanding to full regression coverage. This strategy will guide the entire engineering team, including Senior QAs, Test Architects, and SDETs, in their testing efforts.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe application operates within the **e-commerce domain**, where the primary business goal is to facilitate online sales of products. Key functionalities include product browsing, searching, adding items to cart, checkout, and payment processing.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the system can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss**: Inability to process orders leads to direct revenue loss.\n*   **Reputational Damage**: Poor user experience due to bugs can damage brand reputation and customer trust.\n*   **Data Security Breaches**: Vulnerabilities in security can lead to sensitive customer data exposure.\n*   **Operational Inefficiency**: System downtime disrupts business operations and increases support costs.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Smoke Testing:** Core functionalities essential for basic platform operation.\n*   **Regression Testing:** Comprehensive testing of all features and functionalities after code changes.\n*   **Functional Testing:** Verifying that each feature works as designed.\n*   **UI/UX Testing:** Ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.\n*   **Security Testing:** Identifying and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities.\n*   **Performance Testing:** Evaluating the system's responsiveness and scalability.\n*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing:** Ensuring the application works correctly across different browsers and devices.\n\n**Out of Scope (Initially):**\n\n*   **Accessibility Testing:** Ensuring the application is accessible to users with disabilities (to be included in later phases).\n*   **Localization Testing:** Testing the application in different languages and regions (to be included in later phases).\n*   **Advanced Performance Testing (e.g., Load, Stress, Endurance):** Focus on basic performance during smoke and regression.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will serve as the initial \"health check\" for each build. If any of these tests fail, the build will be rejected.\n\n*   **Objective:** Verify the core functionalities are operational.\n*   **Frequency:** Executed after each build deployment.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 and key elements visible).\n    *   **User Login:** Verify a user can log in with valid credentials.\n    *   **Search Functionality:** Verify a user can search for a product (e.g., \"Watch\") and results are displayed.\n    *   **Product Details Page:** Verify a user can view product details after searching.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's features and functionalities.\n\n*   **Objective:** Ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions and that existing functionality remains intact.\n*   **Frequency:** Executed after each code change or deployment to a testing environment.\n*   **Test Case Prioritization:**\n    *   **High Priority:** Critical functionalities such as checkout, payment processing, and user authentication.\n    *   **Medium Priority:** Product catalog, shopping cart, and user account management.\n    *   **Low Priority:** Less frequently used features and edge cases.\n*   **Regression Candidates (Examples based on the E-commerce Domain Playbook):**\n    *   **Authentication:** Login with Invalid Password, Password Reset Flow, Registration with Existing Email.\n    *   **Product Catalog:** Filter products by Price/Category, Sort products (Price Low-High), Search for non-existent product, Verify Pagination.\n    *   **Shopping Cart:** Update Quantity in Cart, Remove Item from Cart, Add Out-of-Stock Item (Verify Error), Cart Persistence (Refresh Page).\n    *   **Checkout & Payments:** Checkout with formatted Address, Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code, Payment Decline Simulation, Calculate Tax/Shipping correctly.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined user accounts, product information, and payment details for core scenarios.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Generated data for scenarios requiring unique values, such as email addresses and order numbers.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored and managed in a centralized repository to ensure consistency and reusability.\n*   **Data Refresh:** Test data will be refreshed periodically to prevent data conflicts and ensure test accuracy.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application will be represented by a Page Object, which encapsulates the elements and actions available on that page.\n*   **Language:** [Choose a language - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript] - based on team expertise and project requirements.\n*   **Test Framework:** [Choose a framework - e.g., JUnit, pytest, Mocha] - to provide a structured environment for writing and executing tests.\n*   **Assertion Library:** [Choose an assertion library - e.g., AssertJ, Chai] - for writing clear and concise assertions.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met before proceeding with the test. This helps to mitigate timing issues and improve test stability.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures, such as element not found errors. This can involve retrying the action or navigating to a different page.\n*   **Test Environment Stability:**\n    *   **Dedicated Test Environment:** Use a dedicated test environment that is isolated from production to prevent interference and ensure test accuracy.\n    *   **Environment Monitoring:** Monitor the test environment for performance issues and errors to identify and resolve problems quickly.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify the homepage loads correctly and all key elements are present.\n2.  **Search Results Page:** Verify search functionality by searching for \"Watch\" and validating the results.\n3.  **Product Details Page:** Verify the product details page loads correctly and displays all relevant information.\n4.  **Category Pages:** Explore category pages to ensure products are correctly categorized and displayed.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that all pages return an HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Verify that key elements are visible on each page, such as product images, titles, and prices.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text is present on each page, such as \"Welcome\" message after login.\n    *   **Functional Verification:** Verify that core functionalities, such as adding items to cart and proceeding to checkout, work as expected.\n*   **Failure Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Errors:** Any HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500) indicate a failure.\n    *   **Element Not Found:** Failure to locate key elements on a page indicates a failure.\n    *   **Incorrect Text:** Incorrect or missing text indicates a failure.\n    *   **Functional Errors:** Any errors during core functionalities indicate a failure.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for ensuring the quality and reliability of the Magento Software Testing Board e-commerce application. By following this plan, the engineering team can effectively identify and mitigate risks, improve test coverage, and deliver a high-quality product to customers."
