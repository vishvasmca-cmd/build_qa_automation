  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for the Magento e-commerce site, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/)\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Focus:** Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe target application is an e-commerce platform. In this domain, the following areas are considered critical:\n\n*   **Search Functionality:**  Customers must be able to find products quickly and accurately.\n*   **Product Details Page:** Accurate and complete product information is essential for informed purchasing decisions.\n*   **Filtering/Sorting:**  Allows users to refine search results and find desired products efficiently.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure in the specified user goal (Search, Filter, View Product) can lead to:\n\n*   **Lost Sales:**  If users cannot find products, they will likely abandon the site.\n*   **Negative User Experience:**  Frustration due to poor search or filtering can damage brand reputation.\n*   **Reduced Conversion Rates:**  Inability to view product details hinders the buying process.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Search functionality using the search bar.\n    *   Filtering search results by category.\n    *   Display of product details on the product details page.\n    *   Basic navigation to the target URL.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   User registration and login.\n    *   Shopping cart and checkout process.\n    *   Payment gateway integration.\n    *   Order management.\n    *   All other functionalities not directly related to the specified user goal.\n    *   Performance testing, security testing, and accessibility testing (for this smoke test).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will focus on verifying the core functionality required for the specified user goal.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Verify Homepage Load:**  Ensure the Magento homepage loads successfully.\n    2.  **Search for \"Watch\":**  Verify that searching for \"Watch\" returns results.\n    3.  **Filter by Category (Men's Watches):** Verify that filtering the search results by \"Men's Watches\" category works.\n    4.  **View Product Details:**  Verify that clicking on a product from the filtered results leads to the product details page.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Data:** The search term \"Watch\" and the category \"Men's Watches\" will be hardcoded in the test scripts for simplicity and reliability.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*   **N/A:** Since this is a smoke test strategy, a full regression suite is not defined here. However, after the initial smoke tests are successful, a regression suite should be developed to cover variations and edge cases.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   For the smoke tests, we will use static data. This simplifies the test setup and ensures consistency.\n*   For future regression tests, consider using a combination of static and dynamically generated data to cover a wider range of scenarios.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page (Homepage, Search Results Page, Product Details Page) as a separate class. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the homepage (e.g., search bar, search button).\n        *   `SearchResultsPage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the search results page (e.g., filter options, product listings).\n        *   `ProductDetailsPage.java`: Contains elements and methods related to the product details page (e.g., product name, description, price).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous loading of elements. This prevents false failures due to timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:**  Implement explicit waits to ensure that elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:**  Focus on locating the search bar and initiating a search.\n2.  **Search Results Page:**  Focus on identifying category filters and applying the \"Men's Watches\" filter.\n3.  **Product Details Page:**  Focus on verifying the presence of key product information (name, description, price).\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Homepage Load:**  HTTP status code 200 and the presence of the Magento logo or a specific heading.\n*   **Search Results:**  HTTP status code 200 and the presence of product listings containing the word \"Watch\".\n*   **Filter Application:**  The displayed product listings should only contain products within the \"Men's Watches\" category.\n*   **Product Details Page:**  HTTP status code 200 and the presence of the product name, description, and price.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the specified functionality of the Magento e-commerce application. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on critical areas and providing guidance for building a resilient and maintainable testing framework. Remember that this is a living document and should be updated as the application evolves and new requirements emerge."
