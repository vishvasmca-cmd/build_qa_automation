  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for the Magento e-commerce site, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/)\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe application is an e-commerce platform built on Magento.  The core business functions revolve around product discovery, purchasing, and order management.  Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:**  Defects in the checkout process, payment gateway integration, or inventory management can lead to direct financial losses.\n*   **Reputational Damage:**  A poorly functioning website, especially during peak shopping seasons, can damage the brand's reputation and lead to customer churn.\n*   **Data Security Breaches:** Vulnerabilities in user authentication, payment processing, or data storage can lead to data breaches, resulting in legal and financial repercussions.\n*   **Loss of Customer Trust:** Inconsistent or unreliable user experience can erode customer trust and loyalty.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope (For Smoke Testing):**\n\n*   **Core Functionality:** User login, product search, filtering, product detail page viewing, adding to cart, and initiating the checkout process.\n*   **Critical Paths:**  The \"happy path\" scenarios for the above functionalities.\n*   **Essential Integrations:** Basic connectivity to payment gateways (simulated or using test accounts).\n\n**Out of Scope (For Smoke Testing):**\n\n*   **Edge Cases:**  Complex product configurations, advanced search filters, unusual shipping scenarios.\n*   **Negative Testing:**  Invalid input validation, error handling for edge cases.\n*   **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing, and performance optimization.\n*   **Security Testing:** Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning.\n*   **Accessibility Testing:**  WCAG compliance checks.\n*   **Detailed Payment Gateway Testing:** Testing all possible payment scenarios (declined cards, fraud checks, etc.).\n*   **Order Management (Admin Panel):**  Creating, modifying, or canceling orders from the admin interface.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will be executed after each build deployment to ensure the core functionality is operational.  If any smoke test fails, the build is considered unstable and will be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 OK).\n    2.  **User Login:** Login with valid credentials (pre-existing test user).\n    3.  **Search Functionality:** Search for \"Watch\" and verify results are displayed.\n    4.  **Category Filter:** Filter search results by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\").\n    5.  **Product Detail Page:** View details of the first product in the filtered search results.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Regression Scope:** The regression suite will cover a broader range of scenarios, including variations, edge cases, and negative testing. This suite will be executed less frequently than the smoke suite (e.g., nightly or weekly).\n*   **Regression Test Case Examples (Related to Smoke Tests):**\n    *   **Search Functionality:**\n        *   Search for a non-existent product.\n        *   Search using special characters.\n        *   Verify search suggestions.\n    *   **Category Filter:**\n        *   Filter by multiple categories.\n        *   Filter by price range.\n        *   Clear filters.\n    *   **Product Detail Page:**\n        *   Verify product image loads.\n        *   Verify product description is displayed.\n        *   Verify price is displayed.\n        *   Add product to wishlist.\n*   **Test Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Static Test Data:**  A set of pre-defined test users, products, and categories will be used for the smoke tests.  This data will be consistent across all environments.\n    *   **Dynamic Test Data Generation:** For regression tests, consider using dynamic data generation for scenarios like creating new users or adding products to the cart.  This helps avoid data conflicts and ensures test independence.  Faker libraries are recommended.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement the Page Object Model design pattern.  Each page of the application should be represented by a Page Object class.  This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and reduces test duplication.\n*   **Test Framework:**  Choose a robust test framework like Selenium WebDriver (with Java, Python, or C#), Cypress, or Playwright.  The choice depends on the team's expertise and project requirements.\n*   **Reporting:** Integrate with a reporting tool like Allure or Extent Reports to generate detailed test reports with screenshots and logs.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading.  This avoids premature assertion failures due to timing issues.\n*   **Explicit Waits:**  Avoid implicit waits. Use explicit waits to wait for specific elements to be present or visible before interacting with them.\n*   **Self-Healing:**  Implement a self-healing mechanism to automatically locate elements that have changed their locators.  This can be achieved using techniques like relative locators or AI-powered element identification.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  If a test fails, retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (For Autonomous Exploration)\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:**  Verify the basic layout and navigation elements.\n2.  **Search Results Page:**  Verify the search results are displayed correctly and the filter options are working.\n3.  **Product Detail Page:**  Verify the product details are displayed correctly and the \"Add to Cart\" button is functional.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **HTTP Status Codes:**  Verify that all pages return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n*   **Element Visibility:**  Verify that critical elements (e.g., search bar, product images, product descriptions, \"Add to Cart\" button) are visible on the page.\n*   **Text Verification:**  Verify that specific text elements (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product name on the product detail page) are present and correct.\n*   **Functional Verification:**  Verify that the search functionality returns relevant results and the filter options are working as expected.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust and reliable testing framework for the Magento e-commerce application.  It will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changes in the application and business requirements."
