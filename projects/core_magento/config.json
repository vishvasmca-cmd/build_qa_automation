  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for the Magento e-commerce application, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce Platform\n**Target URL:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe target application is an e-commerce platform.  The core business functionality revolves around product discovery, purchase, and order fulfillment.  Failure in any of these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:**  Defects in the checkout process, payment gateway integration, or inventory management can lead to lost sales and revenue.\n*   **Reputational Damage:**  A buggy or unreliable e-commerce experience can damage the brand's reputation and lead to customer churn.\n*   **Data Security Breach:** Vulnerabilities in security can lead to data breaches, resulting in financial and legal repercussions.\n*   **Loss of Customer Trust:** Inability to complete purchases or view accurate product information erodes customer trust.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope (For this Smoke Test):**\n\n*   Homepage accessibility\n*   Product search functionality\n*   Category filtering\n*   Product detail page display\n*   Basic navigation\n\n**Out of Scope (For this Smoke Test):**\n\n*   User registration/login\n*   Shopping cart functionality\n*   Checkout process\n*   Payment gateway integration\n*   Order management\n*   Detailed negative testing\n*   Performance testing\n*   Security testing\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (limited to primary browser - Chrome)\n*   Mobile testing\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will focus on verifying the core functionality required for a user to find and view a product.  If any of these tests fail, the build is considered unstable and should be rejected.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Homepage Load:**\n    *   Description: Verify the homepage loads successfully.\n    *   Priority: P0 (Critical)\n*   **Test Case 2: Product Search:**\n    *   Description: Search for the term \"Watch\" and verify that search results are displayed.\n    *   Priority: P0 (Critical)\n*   **Test Case 3: Category Filter:**\n    *   Description: Filter the search results for \"Watch\" by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\"). Verify the filter is applied correctly.\n    *   Priority: P1 (High)\n*   **Test Case 4: Product Detail Page:**\n    *   Description: Select a product from the filtered search results and verify the product detail page loads correctly.\n    *   Priority: P0 (Critical)\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Future Consideration)\n\n*   **Product Search:**\n    *   Search for various keywords (valid and invalid).\n    *   Verify search suggestions.\n    *   Test advanced search options.\n*   **Category Filtering:**\n    *   Test multiple category filters.\n    *   Verify filter combinations.\n    *   Test price range filters.\n*   **Product Detail Page:**\n    *   Verify product images, descriptions, and pricing.\n    *   Test product reviews.\n    *   Verify related products.\n    *   Test add to wishlist functionality.\n*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**\n    *   Execute tests on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.\n*   **Mobile Testing:**\n    *   Execute tests on various mobile devices and screen sizes.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\nFor the smoke tests, static test data is sufficient.  This includes:\n\n*   Search term: \"Watch\"\n*   Category Filter: \"Men's\" (or any available category for watches)\n\nFor future regression testing, a more robust data strategy will be required, potentially involving:\n\n*   Dynamic test data generation (e.g., using Faker libraries).\n*   Database seeding with pre-defined test data sets.\n*   Data masking for sensitive information.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\nA Page Object Model (POM) is highly recommended for structuring the test automation framework.  This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and readability.\n\n*   **Page Objects:**  Each page of the application (e.g., Homepage, Search Results Page, Product Detail Page) should have its own corresponding Page Object class.  This class encapsulates the page's elements (locators) and actions (methods).\n*   **Test Cases:**  Test cases should interact with the application through the Page Objects, rather than directly manipulating the UI elements.\n*   **Base Test Class:**  A base test class should handle common setup and teardown tasks (e.g., browser initialization, driver management).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\nFlakiness is a common challenge in UI automation.  To mitigate this:\n\n*   **Explicit Waits:**  Use explicit waits (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to be in a specific state (e.g., visible, clickable) before interacting with them.  Avoid implicit waits, as they can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Implement polling assertions to retry assertions for a short period of time.  This can help to overcome intermittent timing issues.\n*   **Self-Healing Locators:**  Consider using self-healing locators (e.g., using AI-powered tools) to automatically update locators when the UI changes.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests. This can help to overcome temporary network issues or server instability.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (For Autonomous Exploration)\n\nFor initial exploration, the autonomous agent should focus on the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:**  Explore all links and navigation elements.\n2.  **Search Results Page:**  Explore different search terms and filter options.\n3.  **Product Detail Page:**  Explore product variations, reviews, and related products.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\nSuccess is defined as:\n\n*   **HTTP Status Code 200:**  All pages should load with an HTTP status code of 200 (OK).\n*   **Expected Content:**  Each page should contain the expected content (e.g., the homepage should contain the store logo, the search results page should contain a list of products).\n*   **Element Visibility:**  Key elements (e.g., search bar, product images, product descriptions) should be visible on the page.\n*   **No JavaScript Errors:**  The browser console should not contain any JavaScript errors.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a foundation for testing the Magento e-commerce application. It will be reviewed and updated as the application evolves and new requirements emerge."
