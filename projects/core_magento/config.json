  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Magento, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-Commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** This is an E-commerce platform. The core business function is enabling users to find and purchase products. Failure in key areas like search, product display, or checkout directly impacts revenue.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Bugs preventing product discovery or purchase completion lead to immediate revenue loss.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Poor search results or broken product pages erode customer trust and brand image.\n    *   **Data Security:** While not the primary focus of this smoke test, any vulnerability exposed during testing must be addressed immediately.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Homepage\n        *   Search functionality\n        *   Product listing pages (category filtered)\n        *   Product detail pages\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   User registration/login\n        *   Shopping cart\n        *   Checkout process\n        *   Payment gateways\n        *   Admin panel\n        *   All other modules not directly related to the specified user goal.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy focuses on a **Smoke Test** to validate the core functionality of searching, filtering, and viewing product details.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Test Case 1: Search and View Product**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage (`https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/`).\n        2.  Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar and submit.\n        3.  Verify that search results are displayed.\n        4.  Filter the search results by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\").\n        5.  Verify that the product listing is updated based on the filter.\n        6.  Click on a product from the filtered list.\n        7.  Verify that the product details page loads correctly.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not executed during Smoke, but defined for future expansion)\n    *   **Search Functionality:**\n        *   Search with different keywords (e.g., \"Shirt\", \"Pants\").\n        *   Search with special characters.\n        *   Search with empty string.\n    *   **Filtering:**\n        *   Filter by multiple categories.\n        *   Filter by price range.\n        *   Clear filters and verify the product listing resets.\n    *   **Product Details Page:**\n        *   Verify product name, price, and description are displayed correctly.\n        *   Verify product images are loading.\n        *   Verify related products are displayed (if applicable).\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   For this smoke test, static data is sufficient. We assume that the product catalog contains at least one \"Watch\" and that the category \"Men's\" exists.\n    *   For future regression tests, a more dynamic data strategy will be needed, potentially involving database seeding or API calls to create test products and categories.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create separate page objects for:\n            *   Homepage\n            *   Search Results Page\n            *   Product Details Page\n    *   **Language:** Python or Java are good choices due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n    *   **Test Runner:** Pytest (Python) or JUnit (Java)\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `wait_until` or similar) to handle asynchronous loading of elements. This is especially important for product images and dynamic content.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. This could involve retrying a test a few times before marking it as failed.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Focus on the search bar element (`<input type=\"text\" id=\"search\">` or similar).\n    2.  **Search Results Page:** Target the product listing container and the category filter elements.\n    3.  **Product Details Page:** Target the product name, price, description, and image elements.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Homepage:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code.\n        *   Search bar is visible and enabled.\n    *   **Search Results Page:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code.\n        *   Search results are displayed (at least one product should be visible).\n        *   Category filter options are displayed.\n        *   The number of products displayed matches the filter criteria.\n    *   **Product Details Page:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code.\n        *   Product name, price, and description are visible.\n        *   Product image is loaded.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Generate clear and concise test reports indicating the pass/fail status of each test case.\n    *   Include screenshots or videos of failed tests to aid in debugging.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing the core functionality of the Magento E-commerce application. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and new features are added."
