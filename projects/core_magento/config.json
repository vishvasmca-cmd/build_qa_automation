  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Magento, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce Platform\n**Target URL:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nThe application is an E-commerce platform. The core business functions revolve around product browsing, purchasing, and order management.  Failure in any of these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n*   **Financial Loss:** Bugs in checkout, payment processing, or inventory management can lead to direct financial losses.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** A poorly functioning website, especially during peak shopping times, can damage the brand's reputation and lead to customer churn.\n*   **Data Security Breaches:** Vulnerabilities in user authentication or payment processing can lead to data breaches, resulting in legal and financial repercussions.\n*   **Loss of Customer Trust:** Inconsistent or unreliable service erodes customer trust and loyalty.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Core product catalog browsing and search functionality.\n    *   Product detail page viewing.\n    *   Filtering and sorting of products.\n    *   User authentication (login/logout).\n    *   Shopping cart functionality (add/remove/update).\n    *   Checkout process (address, shipping, payment).\n    *   Order placement and confirmation.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Admin panel functionality.\n    *   Detailed performance testing (beyond basic load times).\n    *   Detailed security penetration testing (beyond basic vulnerability scans).\n    *   Third-party integrations (except for core payment gateways).\n    *   Detailed mobile app testing (focus on web responsiveness).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nGiven the request for a *smoke* test focusing on searching, filtering, and viewing product details, the strategy will prioritize these areas.\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be the \"Health Check\" to ensure the application is fundamentally operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 and key elements present).\n    2.  **User Login:** Verify a user can log in with valid credentials.\n    3.  **Search Functionality:** Search for \"Watch\" and verify results are displayed.\n    4.  **Filter by Category:** Filter the search results by a specific category (e.g., \"Watches\").\n    5.  **View Product Details:** Select a product from the filtered results and verify the product details page loads correctly.\n    6.  **Add to Cart:** Add the selected product to the shopping cart.\n    7.  **Checkout Initiation:** Proceed to the checkout page.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After every build and deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nWhile the initial request is for a smoke test, a high-level regression strategy is outlined below for future expansion.\n\n*   **Authentication:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts.\n    *   Password reset flow.\n    *   Account locking.\n*   **Product Catalog:**\n    *   Searching for non-existent products.\n    *   Sorting by different criteria (price, rating).\n    *   Filtering by multiple attributes.\n*   **Shopping Cart:**\n    *   Updating quantities.\n    *   Removing items.\n    *   Handling out-of-stock items.\n*   **Checkout & Payments:**\n    *   Applying coupon codes (valid and invalid).\n    *   Simulating payment failures.\n    *   Validating address formats.\n    *   Calculating taxes and shipping costs.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Smoke Tests:** Use a small set of static, pre-defined test data (e.g., a known user account, a specific product). This data should be consistent and reliable.\n*   **Regression Tests:** Employ a combination of static and dynamically generated data.\n    *   **Static Data:** Use for core scenarios and boundary value testing.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Generate data for scenarios requiring unique values (e.g., new user registration, unique order IDs).  Consider using data factories or Faker libraries.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and reduces test duplication.\n    *   Each page class should contain:\n        *   Locators for all relevant elements on the page.\n        *   Methods representing the actions that can be performed on the page.\n*   **Language:** Python with pytest framework.\n*   **Selenium:** For browser automation.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_until` with a timeout) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to handle dynamic content loading.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms, such as retrying element interactions or refreshing the page if an element is not found.\n*   **Test Environment Stability:**\n    *   Ensure a dedicated and stable test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.\n    *   Implement regular environment health checks to identify and resolve issues proactively.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nGiven the user goal, the autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** To identify search input and navigation elements.\n2.  **Search Results Page:** To understand how search results are displayed and filtered.\n3.  **Category Pages:** To learn how products are categorized and filtered.\n4.  **Product Detail Page:** To identify key product information and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Definition:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return a 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Ensure that key elements (e.g., search results, product details, cart summary) are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text (e.g., \"Welcome,\" product names, prices) is present and accurate.\n    *   **Functional Verification:** Ensure that actions (e.g., adding to cart, filtering) perform as expected.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing the Magento E-commerce application. It will be reviewed and updated as the application evolves and new requirements emerge."

  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for the Magento e-commerce site, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type. This document is designed to guide the entire engineering team in building a robust and reliable testing framework.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Platform\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: This is an e-commerce platform. The core business revolves around product discovery and sales. Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue.\n*   **Risk Profile**:\n    *   **Financial Loss**: Bugs in search, filtering, or product details can lead to lost sales.\n    *   **Reputational Damage**: Poor user experience due to broken functionality can damage brand reputation.\n    *   **Data Integrity**: Issues with product data (incorrect pricing, descriptions) can lead to customer dissatisfaction and legal issues.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Search functionality\n        *   Product catalog browsing and filtering\n        *   Product detail page\n        *   Core UI elements related to search and product display\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   User account management (registration, login) - covered in separate Authentication module.\n        *   Shopping cart and checkout process - covered in separate Shopping Cart and Checkout modules.\n        *   Backend admin panel\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress)\n        *   Security testing (penetration, vulnerability scanning)\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - to be addressed in a separate phase.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nGiven the request is for a SMOKE test, we will focus on the 'happy path' to ensure core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the core search and product viewing functionality is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Search for Product**: Search for the term \"Watch\" and verify results are displayed.\n        2.  **Filter by Category**: Filter the search results by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\").\n        3.  **View Product Details**: Select a product from the filtered results and verify the product details page loads correctly.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**: (While this is a smoke test strategy, outlining the regression strategy provides context for future expansion)\n    *   **Objective**: Ensure changes haven't broken existing search, filtering, and product viewing functionality.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Search for Product (No Results)**: Search for a term that returns no results and verify the appropriate message is displayed.\n        2.  **Filter by Multiple Categories**: Filter by multiple categories simultaneously.\n        3.  **Sort Products**: Sort search results by different criteria (e.g., price, name).\n        4.  **Product Image Verification**: Verify product images load correctly on the product details page.\n        5.  **Product Description Verification**: Verify product descriptions are displayed correctly.\n        6.  **Review Display**: Verify product reviews are displayed correctly.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Static Data**: For the smoke tests, use predefined search terms (\"Watch\") and category filters (\"Men's\"). This ensures consistency and repeatability.\n    *   **Dynamic Data (Future Regression)**: For regression tests, consider using dynamic data generation for search terms and filters to increase test coverage. This can involve reading data from a CSV file or database.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement a POM structure to represent the UI elements and interactions on each page (e.g., Search Results Page, Product Details Page). This promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n    *   **Example Page Objects**:\n        *   `HomePage`: Contains the search input field and search button.\n        *   `SearchResultsPage`: Contains methods to filter results, sort results, and retrieve product links.\n        *   `ProductDetailsPage`: Contains methods to retrieve product details (name, price, description, images).\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Flakiness Handling**:\n        *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to load or conditions to be met before asserting. This helps mitigate timing issues.\n        *   **Explicit Waits**: Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for tests that interact with external services (e.g., database).\n    *   **Self-Healing (Advanced)**:\n        *   Consider implementing a self-healing mechanism that automatically identifies and corrects broken locators. This can involve using AI-powered tools or custom logic to find alternative locators.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Homepage**: Focus on the search input field and search button.\n    2.  **Search Results Page**: Focus on the filter options (categories, price), sort options, and product listings.\n    3.  **Product Details Page**: Focus on the product name, price, description, images, and reviews.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **HTTP Status Code**: Verify that all pages return an HTTP 200 status code, indicating successful page load.\n    *   **Element Visibility**: Verify that key elements (e.g., search results, product details) are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification**: Verify that specific text (e.g., product name, price) is displayed correctly. For example, after searching for \"Watch\", verify that the search results page contains products with the word \"Watch\" in their name or description.\n    *   **Image Verification**: Verify that product images load correctly and are not broken.\n    *   **Functional Verification**: Verify that filtering and sorting options work as expected. For example, after filtering by \"Men's\" category, verify that all displayed products belong to the \"Men's\" category.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust and reliable testing framework for the Magento e-commerce platform. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on the most critical functionality and providing clear guidance for the engineering team. Remember to adapt and refine this strategy as the application evolves and new requirements emerge."
