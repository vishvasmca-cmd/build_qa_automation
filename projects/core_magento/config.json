  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: E-Commerce Application - Magento Software Testing Board\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Magento Software Testing Board e-commerce application, focusing on a risk-based approach to ensure the stability and reliability of critical business functions. This strategy will guide all testing activities, including manual and automated testing efforts.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** This application falls under the E-commerce domain. The core business functions revolve around product browsing, purchasing, and account management. Any failures in these areas directly impact revenue and customer satisfaction.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **High Risk:** Failures in checkout, payment processing, or account security can lead to direct financial loss, data breaches, and severe reputational damage.\n    *   **Medium Risk:** Issues with product catalog browsing, search functionality, or cart management can lead to a degraded user experience and lost sales.\n    *   **Low Risk:** Minor UI glitches or non-critical feature failures.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Authentication (Login, Registration)\n        *   Product Catalog (Browsing, Search, Filtering, Product Details)\n        *   Shopping Cart (Add/Remove Items, Update Quantity)\n        *   Checkout & Payments (Order Placement, Payment Processing)\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed performance testing (beyond basic load checks)\n        *   Advanced security penetration testing (basic security checks are in scope)\n        *   Third-party integrations (initially, focus on core functionality)\n        *   Detailed UI/UX testing (basic visual verification is in scope)\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nThis strategy employs a layered approach, prioritizing smoke and regression testing to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core functionality of the application after each build or deployment. A failed smoke test indicates a critical issue that must be addressed immediately.\n    *   **Scope:**\n        *   User Login (Valid Credentials)\n        *   Homepage Load (Verify key elements are present)\n        *   Product Search (Search for a common product like \"Watch\")\n        *   View Product Details (Verify product name, price, and image are displayed)\n        *   Add Item to Cart\n        *   Checkout (Complete purchase with a standard payment method)\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After every build and deployment.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Purpose:** To ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions or broken existing functionality. This suite covers a wider range of scenarios, including edge cases and negative testing.\n    *   **Scope:**\n        *   **Authentication:**\n            *   Login with Invalid Password\n            *   Password Reset Flow\n            *   Registration with Existing Email\n        *   **Product Catalog:**\n            *   Filter products by Price/Category\n            *   Sort products (Price Low-High)\n            *   Search for non-existent product\n            *   Verify Pagination\n        *   **Shopping Cart:**\n            *   Update Quantity in Cart\n            *   Remove Item from Cart\n            *   Add Out-of-Stock Item (Verify Error)\n            *   Cart Persistence (Refresh Page)\n        *   **Checkout & Payments:**\n            *   Checkout with formatted Address\n            *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code\n            *   Payment Decline Simulation\n            *   Calculate Tax/Shipping correctly\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** Nightly, and before each major release.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:** Used for core scenarios (e.g., valid login credentials, common product names). This data will be stored in a centralized repository (e.g., JSON files, database).\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Used for scenarios requiring unique data (e.g., new user registration, unique order IDs). This data will be generated programmatically during test execution.\n    *   **Data Management:** A clear process for managing and maintaining test data will be established to ensure data integrity and consistency.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** This design pattern will be used to create reusable and maintainable test code. Each page of the application will be represented by a Page Object, which encapsulates the elements and actions available on that page.\n    *   **Language:** Python or Java (depending on team expertise)\n    *   **Test Runner:** Pytest or TestNG\n    *   **Assertion Library:** Pytest Assertions or AssertJ\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling mechanisms (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or conditions to be met before asserting.\n        *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement retry mechanisms for failed tests, especially for those that are known to be flaky.\n        *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques to automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n    *   **Environment Stability:**\n        *   Ensure a stable and dedicated test environment that closely mirrors the production environment.\n        *   Implement infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to easily provision and manage test environments.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Prioritized Pages/Flows:**\n        *   Homepage\n        *   Login Page\n        *   Product Listing Page (Category Pages)\n        *   Product Details Page\n        *   Shopping Cart Page\n        *   Checkout Page\n    *   **Specific Flows to Explore First:**\n        *   Search for \"Watch\", filter by category (e.g., \"Analog\"), and view product details.\n        *   Add the selected watch to the cart.\n        *   Proceed to checkout as a guest user.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **General Success Criteria:**\n        *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK for all page requests.\n        *   No JavaScript errors in the browser console.\n        *   Page load time within acceptable limits (to be defined).\n    *   **Specific Verification Criteria:**\n        *   **Homepage:** Verify that the main navigation menu, featured products, and promotional banners are displayed correctly.\n        *   **Login Page:** Verify that the login form is displayed and that users can successfully log in with valid credentials.\n        *   **Product Listing Page:** Verify that products are displayed correctly, that filtering and sorting options are working, and that pagination is functioning as expected.\n        *   **Product Details Page:** Verify that product name, price, image, description, and add-to-cart button are displayed correctly.\n        *   **Shopping Cart Page:** Verify that items added to the cart are displayed correctly, that users can update quantities and remove items, and that the cart total is calculated correctly.\n        *   **Checkout Page:** Verify that users can enter shipping and billing information, select a payment method, and place an order successfully.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the business and the application."
