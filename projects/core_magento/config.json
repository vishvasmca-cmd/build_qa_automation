  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Magento, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-Commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-Commerce Platform\n**Target URL:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-Commerce\n**Testing Type:** Smoke\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nMagento is a critical e-commerce platform. Its core function is to facilitate online sales. Failure in key areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.  The ability to search for products and view details is fundamental to the user experience and sales funnel.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to search or view product details prevents customers from making purchases, leading to direct revenue loss.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Poor user experience due to broken search or product pages can damage brand reputation and customer trust.\n*   **Lost Sales Opportunities:** If customers cannot find the products they want, they will likely go to a competitor.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Successful search for a product (\"Watch\").\n    *   Filtering search results by category.\n    *   Viewing product details page.\n    *   Basic page load and rendering.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   All other functionalities of the website (e.g., checkout, account management, etc.).\n    *   Negative testing (e.g., searching for invalid terms).\n    *   Performance testing.\n    *   Security testing.\n    *   Accessibility testing.\n    *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially, focus on Chrome).\n    *   Mobile testing (initially, focus on desktop).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of a minimal set of tests to verify the core functionality related to the user goal.\n\n*   **Test Case 1: Search Functionality**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the user can successfully search for a product.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage (https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/).\n        2.  Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar.\n        3.  Press Enter or click the search icon.\n        4.  Verify that search results are displayed.\n*   **Test Case 2: Category Filter**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the user can filter search results by category.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Perform the search as in Test Case 1.\n        2.  Select a category filter (e.g., \"Men's Watches\").\n        3.  Verify that the search results are filtered correctly.\n*   **Test Case 3: Product Details Page**\n    *   **Description:** Verify that the user can view the details of a product.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Perform the search and filter as in Test Cases 1 and 2.\n        2.  Click on a product in the search results.\n        3.  Verify that the product details page loads correctly.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite\n\n*   **Note:** Since this is a *smoke* test strategy, the regression suite is currently out of scope. However, for future expansion, a regression suite *would* include variations such as:\n    *   Searching for different types of watches (e.g., \"Digital Watch\", \"Smartwatch\").\n    *   Filtering by multiple categories.\n    *   Verifying product image loading.\n    *   Checking for related products.\n    *   Validating product price and description.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** For the smoke tests, we will use static test data. The search term \"Watch\" is pre-defined.  Category filters will be selected from the available options on the page.\n*   **Data Management:** No specific data management is required for the smoke tests.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page or section of the application as a separate class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   `HomePage`:  Contains elements and methods related to the homepage (e.g., search bar).\n    *   `SearchResultsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the search results page (e.g., search results, category filters).\n    *   `ProductDetailsPage`: Contains elements and methods related to the product details page (e.g., product name, price, description).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential timing issues and ensure that elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests. If a test fails, retry it a few times before marking it as a failure.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits instead of implicit waits to wait for specific elements to be loaded.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should explore the following pages/flows first:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Focus on the search bar element.\n2.  **Search Results Page:** Focus on the category filters and product listings.\n3.  **Product Details Page:** Focus on the product name, price, description, and image.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Code:** All pages should return an HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Page Content:**\n        *   The search results page should display a list of products related to \"Watch\".\n        *   The product details page should display the product name, price, and description.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** All key elements (search bar, category filters, product listings, product details) should be visible and interactable.\n    *   **No Critical Errors:** The page should not contain any JavaScript errors or other critical errors.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for testing the core search and product viewing functionality of the Magento e-commerce application. It prioritizes critical areas and sets the foundation for a robust testing framework."
