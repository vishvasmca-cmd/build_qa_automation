  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Magento, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce Platform\n**Target URL:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nThe application is an E-commerce platform. The core business functions revolve around product browsing, purchasing, and order management.  Failure in any of these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n*   **Financial Loss:** Bugs in checkout, payment processing, or inventory management can lead to direct financial losses.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** A poorly functioning website, especially during peak shopping times, can damage the brand's reputation and lead to customer churn.\n*   **Data Security Breaches:** Vulnerabilities in user authentication or payment processing can lead to data breaches, resulting in legal and financial repercussions.\n*   **Loss of Customer Trust:** Inconsistent or unreliable service erodes customer trust and loyalty.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Core product catalog browsing and search functionality.\n    *   Product detail page viewing.\n    *   Filtering and sorting of products.\n    *   User authentication (login/logout).\n    *   Shopping cart functionality (add/remove/update).\n    *   Checkout process (address, shipping, payment).\n    *   Order placement and confirmation.\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   Admin panel functionality.\n    *   Detailed performance testing (beyond basic load times).\n    *   Detailed security penetration testing (beyond basic vulnerability scans).\n    *   Third-party integrations (except for core payment gateways).\n    *   Detailed mobile app testing (focus on web responsiveness).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nGiven the request for a *smoke* test focusing on searching, filtering, and viewing product details, the strategy will prioritize these areas.\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be the \"Health Check\" to ensure the application is fundamentally operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 and key elements present).\n    2.  **User Login:** Verify a user can log in with valid credentials.\n    3.  **Search Functionality:** Search for \"Watch\" and verify results are displayed.\n    4.  **Filter by Category:** Filter the search results by a specific category (e.g., \"Watches\").\n    5.  **View Product Details:** Select a product from the filtered results and verify the product details page loads correctly.\n    6.  **Add to Cart:** Add the selected product to the shopping cart.\n    7.  **Checkout Initiation:** Proceed to the checkout page.\n\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After every build and deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** All tests must pass for the build to be considered stable.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nWhile the initial request is for a smoke test, a high-level regression strategy is outlined below for future expansion.\n\n*   **Authentication:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts.\n    *   Password reset flow.\n    *   Account locking.\n*   **Product Catalog:**\n    *   Searching for non-existent products.\n    *   Sorting by different criteria (price, rating).\n    *   Filtering by multiple attributes.\n*   **Shopping Cart:**\n    *   Updating quantities.\n    *   Removing items.\n    *   Handling out-of-stock items.\n*   **Checkout & Payments:**\n    *   Applying coupon codes (valid and invalid).\n    *   Simulating payment failures.\n    *   Validating address formats.\n    *   Calculating taxes and shipping costs.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Smoke Tests:** Use a small set of static, pre-defined test data (e.g., a known user account, a specific product). This data should be consistent and reliable.\n*   **Regression Tests:** Employ a combination of static and dynamically generated data.\n    *   **Static Data:** Use for core scenarios and boundary value testing.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Generate data for scenarios requiring unique values (e.g., new user registration, unique order IDs).  Consider using data factories or Faker libraries.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the application as a class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and reduces test duplication.\n    *   Each page class should contain:\n        *   Locators for all relevant elements on the page.\n        *   Methods representing the actions that can be performed on the page.\n*   **Language:** Python with pytest framework.\n*   **Selenium:** For browser automation.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `wait_until` with a timeout) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with reasonable timeouts to handle dynamic content loading.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms, such as retrying element interactions or refreshing the page if an element is not found.\n*   **Test Environment Stability:**\n    *   Ensure a dedicated and stable test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.\n    *   Implement regular environment health checks to identify and resolve issues proactively.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nGiven the user goal, the autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages/flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** To identify search input and navigation elements.\n2.  **Search Results Page:** To understand how search results are displayed and filtered.\n3.  **Category Pages:** To learn how products are categorized and filtered.\n4.  **Product Detail Page:** To identify key product information and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Definition:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all page requests return a 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:** Ensure that key elements (e.g., search results, product details, cart summary) are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text (e.g., \"Welcome,\" product names, prices) is present and accurate.\n    *   **Functional Verification:** Ensure that actions (e.g., adding to cart, filtering) perform as expected.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing the Magento E-commerce application. It will be reviewed and updated as the application evolves and new requirements emerge."
