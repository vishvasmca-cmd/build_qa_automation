  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for the Magento e-commerce application, focusing on the specified user goal and testing type.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Magento E-commerce Application\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Application:** Magento E-commerce Platform\n**Target URL:** https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nThe application is an e-commerce platform.  The core business functions revolve around product discovery, shopping cart management, and order fulfillment.  Failure in these areas directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n*   **Financial Loss:**  Defects in checkout or payment processing can lead to lost sales and revenue.\n*   **Reputational Damage:**  A buggy or unreliable platform can damage the brand's reputation and erode customer trust.\n*   **Data Security:**  Vulnerabilities in security can lead to data breaches and compromise customer information.\n*   **Operational Disruption:**  Critical system failures can disrupt business operations and prevent customers from making purchases.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n*   **In Scope:**\n    *   Search functionality\n    *   Product catalog browsing and filtering\n    *   Product detail page\n    *   Core navigation elements\n*   **Out of Scope:**\n    *   User account management (registration, login, profile) - *For this specific smoke test, we assume a user is already logged in or doesn't need to be.*\n    *   Shopping cart and checkout process - *Deferred to a separate, more comprehensive test suite.*\n    *   Backend admin panel\n    *   Performance testing\n    *   Security testing\n    *   Accessibility testing\n    *   Third-party integrations (e.g., payment gateways) - *Stubs/Mocks should be used if necessary.*\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nGiven the request is for a *smoke* test, the strategy will focus on verifying the core functionality of the specified user goal.\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\n*   **Purpose:**  To quickly verify that the core functionality of searching, filtering, and viewing product details is working as expected.  This suite will be executed after each build deployment.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Search for \"Watch\":**\n        *   Navigate to the homepage.\n        *   Enter \"Watch\" in the search bar.\n        *   Verify that search results are displayed.\n    2.  **Filter by Category:**\n        *   From the search results page, filter the results by a specific category (e.g., \"Men's\").\n        *   Verify that the results are filtered correctly, showing only watches in the selected category.\n    3.  **View Product Details:**\n        *   Click on a product from the filtered search results.\n        *   Verify that the product details page loads successfully, displaying the product name, image, price, and description.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\n*   **Purpose:** *While this is a smoke test strategy, it's important to outline the regression strategy for future expansion.*  The regression suite will provide comprehensive coverage of all functionality, including edge cases and error handling.\n*   **Test Cases (Examples - Not exhaustive):**\n    *   Search:\n        *   Search for different keywords (e.g., \"Shirt\", \"Shoes\").\n        *   Search for non-existent products.\n        *   Use advanced search options (if available).\n    *   Filtering:\n        *   Filter by multiple categories.\n        *   Filter by price range.\n        *   Filter by brand.\n    *   Product Details:\n        *   Verify product image zoom functionality.\n        *   Verify product reviews (if available).\n        *   Verify related products (if available).\n        *   Verify add to cart functionality (basic).\n*   **Execution Frequency:**  Executed on a nightly basis or before major releases.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Smoke Tests:**  Static test data will be used for the smoke tests.  This data will be pre-defined and consistent across all environments.  Example:  The keyword \"Watch\" is expected to always return results.\n*   **Regression Tests:**  A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used for the regression tests.  Dynamic data will be generated to cover a wider range of scenarios and edge cases.  Consider using a test data management tool.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page of the application as a class.  This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n    *   Example:  `HomePage`, `SearchResultsPage`, `ProductDetailsPage`\n*   **Test Framework:**  Recommend using a robust and widely adopted test framework such as:\n    *   **Selenium WebDriver:** For browser automation.\n    *   **TestNG or JUnit:** For test execution and reporting.\n    *   **Maven or Gradle:** For dependency management and build automation.\n*   **Reporting:**  Integrate with a reporting tool to generate detailed test reports (e.g., Allure Report).\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to be present or conditions to be met before proceeding.  This will help to mitigate timing issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:**  Implement a retry mechanism to automatically retry failed tests.  This can help to address intermittent issues.\n    *   **Self-Healing:**  Explore self-healing capabilities to automatically identify and fix broken locators.  (e.g., using AI-powered tools).\n*   **Environment Stability:**  Ensure that the test environment is stable and consistent.  Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to create reproducible environments.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets (Prioritized Exploration)\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:**  Focus on the search bar and navigation elements.\n2.  **Search Results Page:**  Focus on the filtering options and product listings.\n3.  **Product Details Page:**  Focus on the product information, images, and add to cart button.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   **HTTP 200 Status Code:**  All pages should load successfully with an HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   **Expected Elements Present:**  Key elements on each page should be present and visible (e.g., search bar on the homepage, product name and price on the product details page).\n    *   **Correct Data Displayed:**  The data displayed on each page should be accurate and consistent (e.g., the correct product name and price should be displayed on the product details page).\n    *   **No JavaScript Errors:**  The browser console should be free of JavaScript errors.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   **HTTP Error Codes:**  Any HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500) indicate a failure.\n    *   **Missing Elements:**  Missing key elements indicate a failure.\n    *   **Incorrect Data:**  Incorrect data indicates a failure.\n    *   **JavaScript Errors:**  JavaScript errors indicate a failure.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for testing the Magento e-commerce application. It will be reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in the application and business requirements."
