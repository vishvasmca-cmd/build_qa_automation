  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Banking Application - `https://demo.applitools.com/`\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the banking application located at `https://demo.applitools.com/`. It serves as a blueprint for all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimizing risks associated with software releases.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThis application operates within the **Banking** domain. Key functionalities include account access, transfers, payments, and statement management.  Given the nature of financial transactions, data security, accuracy, and availability are paramount.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of this system can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect transactions, unauthorized access, or data breaches can lead to direct financial losses for both the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised customer data (PII, financial information) can lead to legal and reputational damage.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** System outages, errors, or security vulnerabilities can erode customer trust and damage the bank's reputation.\n*   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Failure to meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) can result in fines and legal action.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to Account Access, Transfers & Payments, and Statements & History, as defined in the Domain Playbook.\n*   User interface elements and their interactions.\n*   API endpoints used by the application.\n*   Security aspects, including authentication, authorization, and data protection.\n*   Performance aspects, including page load times and transaction processing speed.\n*   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Third-party integrations (unless explicitly identified as critical).\n*   Infrastructure testing (server performance, network stability).\n*   Penetration testing (requires specialized security expertise - recommend a separate engagement).\n*   Load testing (requires a dedicated performance testing environment and strategy).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Purpose:** Verify the basic health of the application.\n*   **Frequency:** After each build deployment to the test environment.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Customer Login (Valid Credentials)\n    *   View Account Dashboard (Successful Load)\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** If any Smoke Test fails, the build is rejected.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of all functionalities.\n\n*   **Purpose:** Ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions and that existing functionality remains intact.\n*   **Frequency:** Before each release to production.\n*   **Test Areas:**\n    *   **Account Access:**\n        *   Login with Biometrics/MFA\n        *   Recover Forgotten Username/Password\n        *   Session Timeout Handling\n        *   Invalid Login Attempts (Account Lockout)\n    *   **Transfers & Payments:**\n        *   Internal Fund Transfer (Checking to Savings)\n        *   Bill Payment (Standard)\n        *   Transfer exceeding balance (Insufficient Funds)\n        *   Transfer exceeding daily limit\n        *   Schedule Future Date Transfer\n        *   Add New Payee/Beneficiary\n        *   Cancel Scheduled Transfer\n        *   Payment to Invalid Account Number\n    *   **Statements & History:**\n        *   View Recent Transactions\n        *   Download Statement (PDF/CSV)\n        *   Search Transactions by Keyword\n        *   Filter Transactions by Amount Range\n        *   Statement Generation for Different Time Periods\n*   **Testing Types:**\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid inputs (e.g., special characters in name fields, negative amounts).\n        *   Boundary values (e.g., minimum/maximum transfer amounts).\n        *   Timeouts (e.g., session expiration, API timeouts).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency (multiple users accessing the same account simultaneously).\n        *   Network failures (simulating network outages during transactions).\n        *   Empty states (e.g., no transaction history).\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks (input validation to prevent SQLi and XSS).\n        *   Password complexity requirements.\n        *   Secure session management.\n        *   Data encryption in transit and at rest.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Pre-defined user accounts with varying balances and transaction histories.  This data will be used for core functionality testing.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Data generated during test execution (e.g., new payees, scheduled transfers). This will ensure uniqueness and avoid conflicts.\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   A dedicated test data management strategy will be implemented to ensure data integrity and consistency.\n    *   Sensitive data (e.g., account numbers, passwords) will be masked or encrypted.\n    *   Test data will be refreshed periodically to prevent data staleness.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a Page Object Model to represent each page or component of the application as a separate class. This will improve code maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Language:** Java or Python are recommended due to their extensive libraries and community support.\n*   **Test Framework:** JUnit or pytest.\n*   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ or Hamcrest.\n*   **Reporting:** Allure or ExtentReports.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with `awaitility`) to wait for elements to become visible or for conditions to be met.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous operations.\n    *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry mechanisms for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n*   **Self-Healing:**\n    *   **Dynamic Locators:** Use dynamic locators that adapt to changes in the UI.\n    *   **Element Identification Strategies:** Prioritize robust element identification strategies (e.g., using IDs or data attributes instead of fragile XPath expressions).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize the following pages/flows for exploration:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://demo.applitools.com/` - Focus on different login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials, MFA).\n2.  **Account Summary Page:** (Post-Login) - Explore the account dashboard, focusing on data accuracy and UI elements.\n3.  **Transfer Funds Page:** (Navigation from Account Summary) - Explore different transfer scenarios (internal/external, amounts, scheduling).\n4.  **Bill Payment Page:** (Navigation from Account Summary) - Explore bill payment functionality, including adding payees and scheduling payments.\n5.  **Transaction History Page:** (Navigation from Account Summary) - Explore transaction filtering and statement download options.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success Definition:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all requests return the expected HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK for successful requests, 400/500 for errors).\n    *   **UI Element Verification:** Verify that key UI elements are present and display the correct data.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text strings are visible on the page (e.g., \"Welcome, [Username]\", \"Account Balance: [Amount]\").\n    *   **Data Accuracy:** Verify that data displayed on the UI matches the expected values (e.g., account balances, transaction details).\n*   **Error Handling:**\n    *   Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or unexpected conditions.\n    *   Verify that the system handles errors gracefully and does not crash or expose sensitive information.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.\n"
