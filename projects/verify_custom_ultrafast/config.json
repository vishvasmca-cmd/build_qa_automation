  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Banking Application - `https://demo.applitools.com/`\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the banking application located at `https://demo.applitools.com/`. It serves as a blueprint for all testing activities, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimizing risks associated with software releases.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis: Banking\n\nThe application falls under the Banking domain, which is inherently critical due to its direct impact on financial transactions, customer data, and regulatory compliance. Failure in this domain can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect transactions, unauthorized access, and data breaches can result in direct financial losses for both the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised customer data (PII, financial information) can lead to identity theft, fraud, and regulatory fines.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust due to security vulnerabilities or unreliable service can severely damage the bank's reputation.\n*   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) can result in hefty fines and legal action.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   **Account Access:** Login, Logout, Account Dashboard, Password Recovery, MFA.\n*   **Transfers & Payments:** Internal Transfers, Bill Payments, Adding Payees, Scheduled Transfers, Insufficient Funds Handling.\n*   **Statements & History:** Viewing Transactions, Downloading Statements, Transaction Search and Filtering.\n*   **Security:** Basic OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (Input Validation, Authentication, Authorization).\n*   **UI/UX:** Visual Regression Testing (using Applitools Eyes) to ensure consistent rendering across browsers and devices.\n*   **Accessibility:** Basic accessibility checks to ensure compliance with WCAG guidelines.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing, and endurance testing (addressed in a separate performance testing strategy).\n*   **Penetration Testing:** In-depth security vulnerability assessment (handled by a dedicated security team).\n*   **Mobile App Testing:** Testing of native mobile applications (covered by a separate mobile testing strategy).\n*   **API Testing:** Direct testing of backend APIs (covered by a separate API testing strategy).\n*   **Compliance Testing:** Detailed compliance testing against specific regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) beyond basic security checks.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will be executed after each build to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Successful Login with valid credentials.\n    *   Account Dashboard loads successfully, displaying account information.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** If any test in the Smoke Suite fails, the build is rejected.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will be executed to ensure that new changes have not introduced regressions and that existing functionality remains intact.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid Login attempts (incorrect username/password).\n    *   Transfer exceeding balance (Insufficient Funds).\n    *   Transfer exceeding daily limit.\n    *   Invalid input formats (e.g., special characters in name fields).\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users accessing the same account simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures: Simulate network interruptions during transactions.\n    *   Empty states: Handling empty transaction history or account lists.\n    *   Session Timeout Handling: Verify proper logout and data protection after inactivity.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic Input Validation: Prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks by validating all user inputs.\n    *   Authentication: Verify secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., password hashing, MFA).\n    *   Authorization: Ensure users only have access to authorized resources and functionalities.\n*   **UI/UX:**\n    *   Visual Regression Testing: Use Applitools Eyes to detect visual regressions across different browsers and devices.\n*   **Accessibility:**\n    *   Check for basic accessibility issues using automated tools and manual testing.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined user accounts with varying balances and transaction histories.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Generate random data for fields like names, addresses, and amounts to increase test coverage.\n*   **Data Management:**\n    *   Use a dedicated test database to isolate test data from production data.\n    *   Implement data cleanup procedures to reset the database after each test run.\n    *   Consider using data masking techniques to protect sensitive data in test environments.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should have a corresponding Page Object that encapsulates the page's elements and actions.\n*   **Language:** Java or JavaScript (based on team expertise).\n*   **Testing Framework:** JUnit or TestNG (Java), Mocha or Jest (JavaScript).\n*   **Assertion Library:** AssertJ (Java), Chai (JavaScript).\n*   **Reporting:** Allure or Extent Reports.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to wait for elements to appear or conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading.\n    *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests to reduce false positives.\n*   **Self-Healing:**\n    *   **Dynamic Element Locators:** Use dynamic element locators (e.g., XPath with relative positioning) to adapt to UI changes.\n    *   **AI-Powered Self-Healing:** Explore AI-powered self-healing tools that can automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://demo.applitools.com/` - Focus on different login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials, MFA).\n2.  **Account Summary Page:** After successful login, explore the main account dashboard.\n3.  **Transfer Funds Page:** Navigate to the internal funds transfer page.\n4.  **Bill Payment Page:** Navigate to the bill payment page.\n5.  **Transaction History Page:** Navigate to the transaction history page.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Successful Login:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   \"Welcome\" text visible on the Account Summary page.\n    *   Account information (balance, transaction history) is displayed correctly.\n*   **Successful Transfer:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   Confirmation message displayed.\n    *   Account balances updated correctly.\n    *   Transaction recorded in the transaction history.\n*   **Successful Bill Payment:**\n    *   HTTP 200 status code.\n    *   Confirmation message displayed.\n    *   Account balance updated correctly.\n    *   Transaction recorded in the transaction history.\n*   **Visual Stability:**\n    *   Applitools Eyes should detect no visual regressions in the UI.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the banking application. It will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the business and the changing technology landscape.\n"
