  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Banking Application - `https://demo.applitools.com/`\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the banking application located at `https://demo.applitools.com/`. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding testing efforts and ensuring the delivery of a high-quality, reliable, and secure application.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nThe application falls under the **Banking** domain, which is inherently critical due to its direct impact on users' financial well-being and the potential for significant financial loss in case of failure. Core functionalities include account access, fund transfers, statement generation, and user management.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of this application can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Incorrect transactions, unauthorized access, and data breaches can result in direct financial losses for both the bank and its customers.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised user data (account details, personal information) can lead to identity theft and regulatory penalties.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust due to security vulnerabilities or functional defects can severely damage the bank's reputation.\n*   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with financial regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) can result in significant fines and legal repercussions.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to account access, fund transfers, statements & history, and user management.\n*   Security aspects, including authentication, authorization, and data protection.\n*   Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.\n*   Performance and scalability under expected load.\n*   Accessibility compliance (WCAG).\n*   API testing for all backend services.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Third-party integrations (initially, unless critical to core functionality).\n*   Detailed performance testing beyond basic load testing (will be addressed in a separate performance testing strategy).\n*   Penetration testing (will be conducted by a specialized security team).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will provide a rapid health check of the application after each build. It will focus on the most critical \"happy path\" scenarios.\n\n*   **Scope:**\n    *   Successful Login with valid credentials.\n    *   Loading of the Account Dashboard (verifying key elements are present).\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment to any environment.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** If any test in the Smoke Suite fails, the build is rejected.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive testing of all functionalities, ensuring that new changes have not introduced regressions.\n\n*   **Scope:**\n    *   **Account Access:**\n        *   Login with valid and invalid credentials.\n        *   Password reset functionality.\n        *   Session timeout handling.\n        *   Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.\n    *   **Transfers & Payments:**\n        *   Internal fund transfers (checking to savings, savings to checking).\n        *   Bill payments to existing and new payees.\n        *   Scheduled future-dated transfers.\n        *   Transfer exceeding balance (insufficient funds).\n        *   Transfer exceeding daily/weekly limits.\n        *   Cancellation of scheduled transfers.\n    *   **Statements & History:**\n        *   Viewing recent transactions.\n        *   Downloading statements in PDF and CSV formats.\n        *   Searching transactions by keyword, date range, and amount range.\n        *   Filtering transactions by type (e.g., deposits, withdrawals).\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid input data (e.g., special characters in account numbers).\n        *   Boundary value testing (e.g., minimum and maximum transfer amounts).\n        *   Error handling for network failures and timeouts.\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency testing (multiple users accessing the same account simultaneously).\n        *   Handling of empty states (e.g., no transaction history).\n        *   Testing with large datasets (e.g., accounts with thousands of transactions).\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks (input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks).\n        *   Authentication and authorization testing.\n        *   Data encryption in transit and at rest.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment to the QA environment, and before release to production.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Pre-defined sets of user accounts, payment details, and transaction data will be used for core functionality testing.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Data will be dynamically generated for negative testing, boundary value testing, and edge cases.  This will be achieved through API calls or database seeding scripts.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be managed in a centralized repository (e.g., a dedicated test database) to ensure consistency and avoid data conflicts.\n*   **Data Masking:** Sensitive data (e.g., account numbers, social security numbers) will be masked or anonymized in non-production environments to protect user privacy.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  A Page Object Model (POM) is strongly recommended. This will improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application will be represented by a Page Object, which encapsulates the elements and actions that can be performed on that page.\n*   **Language:** [Choose language based on team expertise - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript]\n*   **Test Framework:** [Choose framework based on team expertise - e.g., JUnit, pytest, Mocha]\n*   **Assertion Library:** [Choose library based on team expertise - e.g., AssertJ, Chai]\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Flakiness Handling:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or for conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests, especially for tests that interact with external services or databases.\n    *   **Self-Healing:** Explore self-healing techniques (e.g., using AI-powered tools) to automatically identify and fix broken locators.\n*   **Environment Stability:**\n    *   Ensure that the test environment is stable and consistent.\n    *   Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to create isolated test environments.\n    *   Automate the deployment and configuration of the test environment.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Login Page:** `https://demo.applitools.com/` - Focus on all input fields, error messages, and links.\n2.  **Account Summary Page:** (After successful login) - Focus on the financial table, account details, and navigation elements.\n3.  **Transfer Funds Page:** (If available) - Focus on input fields, payee selection, and confirmation process.\n4.  **Statements Page:** (If available) - Focus on date selection, download options, and transaction filtering.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **General:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:** Verify that all requests return the expected HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 302 Redirect, 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error).\n    *   **Error Messages:** Verify that error messages are displayed correctly and are informative.\n    *   **UI Elements:** Verify that all UI elements are displayed correctly and are functional.\n*   **Specific:**\n    *   **Login Page:**\n        *   Successful login redirects to the Account Summary Page.\n        *   Invalid login displays an appropriate error message.\n    *   **Account Summary Page:**\n        *   The financial table is displayed correctly with accurate data.\n        *   Account details (e.g., account number, balance) are displayed correctly.\n    *   **Transfer Funds Page:**\n        *   Transfers are processed successfully and reflected in the account balance.\n        *   Error messages are displayed for invalid transfer amounts or insufficient funds.\n    *   **Statements Page:**\n        *   Statements can be downloaded successfully in the specified format.\n        *   Transaction filtering works correctly.\n\n**Success Definition:** All tests pass, and the application meets the defined quality criteria (functionality, security, performance, and usability).\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.\n"
