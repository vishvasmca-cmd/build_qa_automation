  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Demo Applitools Application\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the demo Applitools application, focusing on comprehensive regression testing to ensure application stability and reliability. This strategy will guide the QA team in developing and executing effective tests, mitigating risks, and ensuring a high-quality user experience.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The application is a generic demo site with financial data display and login functionality. The business criticality revolves around accurate data representation and secure user access.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Potential failures include:\n    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect financial data displayed.\n    *   **Authentication Failures:** Users unable to log in or unauthorized access.\n    *   **UI Defects:** Broken layouts, misaligned elements, or incorrect text.\n    *   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Unauthorized data access or manipulation.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All aspects of login functionality (positive and negative scenarios).\n        *   Financial data display and table interactions.\n        *   UI/UX elements related to login and data presentation.\n        *   Basic security checks (input validation).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress).\n        *   Detailed security penetration testing.\n        *   Third-party integrations (if any).\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - Initial focus is on core functionality.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   Purpose: Verify core functionality after deployment.\n    *   Tests:\n        *   Successful login with valid credentials.\n        *   Loading of the main financial data table page.\n        *   Verification that key data elements are present.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**:\n    *   **Login Functionality:**\n        *   **Positive:**\n            *   Login with valid username and password.\n            *   Remember Me functionality (if implemented).\n        *   **Negative:**\n            *   Invalid username.\n            *   Invalid password.\n            *   Empty username and password fields.\n            *   Lockout after multiple failed attempts.\n            *   Password reset functionality (if implemented).\n    *   **Financial Data Table:**\n        *   **Positive:**\n            *   Data is displayed correctly (currency symbols, formatting).\n            *   Table sorting functionality works as expected.\n            *   Filtering/search functionality works as expected.\n            *   Data is consistent across different browsers.\n        *   **Negative:**\n            *   Handling of empty data sets.\n            *   Handling of large data sets.\n            *   Error messages for invalid search criteria.\n            *   Boundary conditions for filtering (e.g., dates).\n    *   **UI/UX:**\n        *   Layout consistency across different browsers and screen sizes.\n        *   Element alignment and visual appeal.\n        *   Error messages are clear and informative.\n        *   Link navigations are correct.\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Input validation to prevent basic XSS and SQL injection attacks on login and search fields.\n        *   Secure handling of credentials (e.g., password encryption).\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   Utilize a combination of static and dynamically generated test data.\n        *   **Static Data:** Use a predefined set of usernames, passwords, and financial data values for core scenarios.\n        *   **Dynamic Generation:** Generate random data for negative testing and boundary conditions to ensure wider coverage.\n        *   Securely store and manage test data (e.g., using a database or encrypted files).\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure for maintainability and reusability. Create separate page objects for the Login Page, Financial Data Table Page, and any other distinct sections of the application.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading. This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).  Limit retries to avoid masking genuine failures.\n    *   **Self-Healing Locators:** Explore using tools or techniques to automatically update locators when UI changes occur.  Prioritize robustness of locators (e.g., using IDs where available, or stable CSS selectors).\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Use `WebDriverWait` or equivalent explicit wait mechanisms rather than implicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Prioritized Exploration):**\n    1.  **Login Page:** Focus on all input fields and error handling related to authentication.\n    2.  **Financial Data Table Page:** Prioritize the table display, sorting, and filtering functionalities. Inspect how data is loaded and rendered.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Successful Login:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code after submitting login form.\n        *   \"Welcome\" message or user-specific dashboard is displayed.\n        *   Correct user role and permissions are applied.\n    *   **Financial Data Table:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for data retrieval requests.\n        *   Table data is displayed in the correct format.\n        *   Sorting and filtering functionality returns the expected results.\n        *   No JavaScript errors are present on the page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the demo Applitools application. By following these guidelines, the QA team can ensure thorough test coverage, identify critical defects, and deliver a high-quality and reliable application. Regular review and updates to this strategy are recommended to adapt to evolving application features and business requirements."
