  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Yandex.ru Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a smoke test of Yandex.ru. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the test automation and execution efforts.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: Yandex.ru is a major search engine and web portal. Its availability and core functionality are critical for user access to information and various services.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**: Failure of the Yandex.ru homepage can lead to significant user frustration, loss of trust, and potential revenue impact due to disrupted advertising and service access.\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Successful loading of the Yandex.ru homepage.\n        *   Existence of key UI elements: Login, Signup/GetStarted, and 3 other buttons.\n        *   Existence of 2 links.\n        *   Existence of 2 menu bars.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Functionality of the search engine itself.\n        *   Detailed testing of individual services (e.g., Mail, Maps).\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Negative testing (e.g., invalid login attempts).\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Test Case 1: Homepage Load and Element Verification**\n        *   **Description**: Verify that the Yandex.ru homepage loads successfully and that key UI elements are present.\n        *   **Steps**:\n            1.  Navigate to `https://yandex.ru`.\n            2.  Verify that the page loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n            3.  Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n            4.  Verify the presence of a \"Signup/GetStarted\" button/link (or equivalent).\n            5.  Verify the presence of 3 other distinct buttons.\n            6.  Verify the presence of 2 links.\n            7.  Verify the presence of 2 menu bars.\n        *   **Expected Result**: The homepage loads successfully, and all specified UI elements are present on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**: Not applicable for this smoke test.  Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   This smoke test does not require any specific test data. The focus is on the presence of UI elements, not their functionality.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   Implement a basic Page Object Model (POM) structure.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` class that represents the Yandex.ru homepage.\n    *   Within the `HomePage` class, define locators for the key UI elements (Login button, Signup button, links, menu bars).\n    *   Create methods within the `HomePage` class to verify the presence of these elements.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions with a reasonable timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) to check for the presence of elements. This helps to mitigate potential timing issues.\n    *   **Explicit Waits**: Implement explicit waits for elements to be present on the page before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  `https://yandex.ru` - The primary target for the smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Success**:\n        *   The Yandex.ru homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code).\n        *   All specified UI elements (Login, Signup/GetStarted, 3 other buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present on the page.\n    *   **Failure**:\n        *   The Yandex.ru homepage fails to load (HTTP error).\n        *   Any of the specified UI elements are missing from the page.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing a smoke test of Yandex.ru. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure that the core functionality of the website is working as expected."
