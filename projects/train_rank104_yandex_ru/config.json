  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Yandex.ru Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a smoke test of the Yandex.ru website. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the site's core functionality.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** Yandex.ru is a major search engine and web portal. While not directly transactional like e-commerce, its availability and core functionality are critical for user access to information and services.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** Failure of Yandex.ru's core functions (search, login, navigation) leads to significant user frustration, loss of trust, and potential reputational damage.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and initial page load.\n        *   Identification of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Verification of the presence and basic accessibility of these elements.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the search engine itself (search queries, results).\n        *   Clicking or interacting with any of the identified elements.\n        *   Detailed testing of individual services or applications linked from the homepage.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing (initially focus on desktop).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n\n    *   **Test Case 1: Website Launch and Element Identification**\n        *   **Description:** Verify the Yandex.ru website loads successfully and key elements are present.\n        *   **Steps:**\n            1.  Navigate to `https://yandex.ru`.\n            2.  Verify the page loads within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., 5 seconds).\n            3.  Verify the presence of:\n                *   Login button/link (or equivalent).\n                *   Signup/Get Started button/link (or equivalent).\n                *   Try for Free button/link (or equivalent).\n                *   5 distinct buttons.\n                *   2 distinct links.\n                *   2 distinct menu bars.\n        *   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully, and all specified elements are present and visible on the page.\n\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):** *Not applicable for a smoke test. This section would be populated for a regression test strategy.*\n\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n\n    *   For this smoke test, no specific test data is required. The focus is on the presence and accessibility of elements, not on data input or processing.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** Page Object Model (POM) is recommended for maintainability and scalability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` class representing the Yandex.ru homepage.\n    *   Within the `HomePage` class, define methods to locate and verify the presence of the required elements (login button, signup link, etc.).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with a timeout) to handle potential loading delays or asynchronous element rendering. This prevents false failures due to timing issues.  Example: Wait up to 5 seconds for the Login button to be present before failing the test.\n    *   **Element Existence Checks:** Before attempting to interact with an element, explicitly check if it exists in the DOM. This prevents errors if an element is not yet loaded or is conditionally rendered.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    *   **Primary Target:** `https://yandex.ru` - The homepage is the sole focus of this smoke test.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code is returned when navigating to `https://yandex.ru`.\n        *   The page title contains \"\u042f\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441\" (or a similar localized equivalent).\n        *   All specified elements (Login, Signup, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars) are present and visible on the page.\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   HTTP error code (e.g., 404, 500) is returned.\n        *   The page fails to load within the acceptable timeframe.\n        *   Any of the specified elements are missing or not visible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing a smoke test of the Yandex.ru website. By following these guidelines, the engineering team can ensure the site's core functionality is verified quickly and effectively."
