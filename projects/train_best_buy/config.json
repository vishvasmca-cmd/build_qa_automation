Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for a smoke test of the Best Buy website (https://www.bestbuy.com). The primary goal of this test is to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational and that key user flows are not broken.  This plan will also guide autonomous agents on what areas of the site to prioritize for future automated testing.\n\n**2. Domain Information & Analysis**\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.bestbuy.com\n*   **Business Domain:** E-commerce (Consumer Electronics, Appliances, Entertainment, Services)\n*   **Target Audience:** Broad consumer base, including tech enthusiasts, casual shoppers, and businesses.\n*   **Key Functionality:**\n    *   Product browsing and search\n    *   Shopping cart and checkout process\n    *   Account management (registration, login, order history)\n    *   Store locator and in-store services\n    *   Deals and promotions\n    *   Customer support resources\n*   **Testing Focus (Smoke):**  The smoke test will concentrate on the critical path of a new user landing on the homepage and initiating a purchase flow. We will verify basic functionality and site availability.\n\n**3. Smoke Test Definition**\n\nThe smoke test suite will comprise the following tests:\n\n*   **Website Availability:**\n    *   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n    *   **Description:** Verify the Best Buy website is accessible and loads without errors.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.bestbuy.com.\n        2.  Verify the HTTP status code is 200 (OK).\n        3.  Verify the page loads within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., under 5 seconds).\n    *   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully, displaying the Best Buy homepage.\n\n*   **Core Navigation (Menu Links):**\n    *   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n    *   **Description:** Verify the main navigation menu links are functional.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.bestbuy.com.\n        2.  Locate the main navigation menu (e.g., identified by `id=\"gh-shop\"` or similar).\n        3.  Click on a representative sample of top-level menu items (e.g., \"TVs\", \"Computers & Tablets\", \"Appliances\").\n        4.  Verify that each clicked link navigates to the expected page.\n    *   **Expected Result:** Each selected menu link navigates to the correct category or landing page.\n\n*   **Core Flow (Homepage Hero Section):**\n    *   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n    *   **Description:** Verify the hero section displays the expected headline and 'Shop Now' button is clickable.\n    *   **Steps:**\n        1.  Navigate to https://www.bestbuy.com.\n        2.  Locate the hero section (typically the most prominent section on the homepage).\n        3.  Verify the hero headline contains the text \"Expert service. Unbeatable price.\".\n        4.  Locate the \"Shop Now\" button within the hero section.\n        5.  Click the \"Shop Now\" button.\n        6.  Verify that clicking the button navigates to a relevant product category page (e.g., deals, featured products).\n    *   **Expected Result:** The hero section displays the correct headline, the \"Shop Now\" button is present and clickable, and clicking the button leads to a product category page.\n\n**4. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents**\n\nThese instructions guide the agent on where to focus its mining efforts to identify key elements and potential test cases for future automation.\n\n*   **Homepage Analysis:**\n    *   **Priority:** High\n    *   **Focus Areas:**\n        *   **Hero Section:** Extract all text, links, and images within the hero section.  Pay close attention to promotional messaging and calls to action. Identify the element used to display the main headline and its variants (A/B testing).\n        *   **Navigation Menu (Top and Footer):**  Extract all menu items, links, and categories. Determine the structure and relationships between the main categories and subcategories. Identify the search bar element and its attributes.\n        *   **Featured Products/Deals:**  Extract product names, prices, ratings, and links to product detail pages. Analyze the criteria used to select featured products (e.g., best sellers, new arrivals, trending items).\n        *   **Footer:** Mine all links in the footer, especially those related to customer service, company information, and legal disclaimers.\n    *   **Element Identification:** Use CSS selectors and XPath to identify key elements. Store these locators for future use.\n*   **Product Detail Page (PDP) Analysis:**\n    *   **Priority:** High\n    *   **Focus Areas:**\n        *   **Product Information:** Extract the product name, model number, price, description, specifications, and customer ratings.\n        *   **Add to Cart/Buy Now Buttons:** Identify the elements used to add the product to the cart and initiate the checkout process.\n        *   **Image Gallery:** Extract all images and videos of the product.\n        *   **Customer Reviews:** Extract customer reviews, ratings, and associated metadata (e.g., date, reviewer name).\n        *   **Related Products:** Extract the names and links to related products.\n    *   **Element Identification:**  Use robust locators (e.g., IDs, data attributes) to identify critical elements.\n*   **Search Functionality Analysis:**\n     *   **Priority:** Medium\n     *   **Focus Areas:**\n          *   **Search Bar:** Understand the search bar's functionality and potential.\n          *   **Search Results Page:** How are results displayed, sorted and filtered?\n*   **Cart and Checkout Flow:**\n    *   **Priority:** Medium\n    *   **Focus Areas:**\n        *   **Shopping Cart:** Extract information about the items in the cart, including product names, quantities, prices, and subtotal.\n        *   **Checkout Process:** Identify the steps involved in the checkout process (e.g., shipping address, billing information, payment method).\n        *   **Error Handling:** Identify potential error messages that may occur during the checkout process (e.g., invalid address, insufficient funds).\n\n**5.  Test Environment**\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:** Windows 10/11 or macOS (latest version)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n**6.  Test Data**\n\n*   No specific test data is required for the smoke test. However, for future test cases involving the checkout process, consider creating test accounts and using valid credit card numbers (using test/sandbox payment gateways).\n\n**7.  Reporting**\n\n*   Test results will be documented in a clear and concise report, including:\n    *   Test Case ID\n    *   Test Case Description\n    *   Pass/Fail Status\n    *   Detailed Steps\n    *   Actual Result\n    *   Expected Result\n    *   Any relevant screenshots or error messages\n\n**8.  Exit Criteria**\n\n*   The smoke test is considered successful if all test cases pass. If any test case fails, the issue should be investigated and resolved before proceeding with further testing.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive test automation strategy for Best Buy. The strategic mining instructions will help the agents prioritize their efforts and identify the most critical elements and functionalities to automate."
