  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan for Omada Health, designed to guide autonomous agents through smoke testing before any automation scripts are written.\n\n# Master Test Plan: Omada Health - Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** https://www.omadahealth.com\n**Business Domain:** Healthcare\n**Testing Type:** Smoke Testing\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for smoke testing the Omada Health website. The primary goal is to ensure the core functionality of the website is operational, accessible, and aligns with the primary user goal of understanding Omada Health's offerings. This test plan focuses on validating the site's availability, basic navigation, and a key user flow.\n\n## 2. Domain Information & Analysis\n\nOmada Health is a digital healthcare company focused on chronic condition management. Their website serves as a primary interface for potential clients (employers, health plans) and potential members (patients) to learn about their programs and offerings. Key aspects of the site likely include:\n\n*   **Informational Content:** Explaining their programs for diabetes, weight management, mental health, etc.\n*   **Client Acquisition:** Forms and information for employers and health plans.\n*   **Member Engagement:** Information and potentially access to the platform for existing members.\n*   **Trust & Credibility:** Displaying certifications, partnerships, and clinical outcomes.\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nThis smoke test will cover the following:\n\n*   **Website Availability:** Verifying the website is accessible and loads correctly.\n*   **Core Navigation:** Testing the main menu links to ensure they navigate to the correct pages.\n*   **Key User Flow:** A \"happy path\" scenario where a user lands on the homepage, verifies a key headline, and begins the \"Get Started\" process.\n\n## 4. Smoke Suite Definition\n\nThe smoke suite will consist of the following test cases:\n\n### 4.1. Website Availability Test\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Case Name:** Website Availability\n*   **Description:** Verify that the Omada Health website is accessible and loads successfully.\n*   **Pre-conditions:** None\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.omadahealth.com\n*   **Expected Result:** The Omada Health homepage loads within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., under 5 seconds). The page should render without any critical errors (e.g., 404, 500 errors).\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n    *   **Pass:** The website loads successfully without errors within the acceptable timeframe.\n    *   **Fail:** The website fails to load, returns an error, or takes an excessively long time to load.\n\n### 4.2. Core Navigation Test\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Case Name:** Core Navigation Links\n*   **Description:** Verify that the main navigation links on the homepage function correctly.\n*   **Pre-conditions:** The Omada Health homepage is loaded.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Locate the main navigation menu.\n    2.  Click on each of the following links:\n        *   \"How It Works\"\n        *   \"For Health Plans\"\n        *   \"For Employers\"\n        *   \"Members\"\n        *   \"About Us\"\n*   **Expected Result:** Each link should navigate to the corresponding page without errors.\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n    *   **Pass:** All navigation links navigate to the correct pages without errors.\n    *   **Fail:** Any navigation link fails to navigate to the correct page or returns an error.\n\n### 4.3. Core User Flow: \"Get Started\"\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Case Name:** \"Get Started\" Flow\n*   **Description:** Verify a user can land on the homepage, verify the hero headline, and begin the \"Get Started\" process.\n*   **Pre-conditions:** The Omada Health homepage is loaded.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Verify that the hero headline contains the text: 'Digital care for chronic conditions'.\n    2.  Locate the \"Get Started\" button on the homepage.\n    3.  Click the \"Get Started\" button.\n*   **Expected Result:**\n    *   The hero headline contains the expected text.\n    *   The \"Get Started\" button is clickable and navigates the user to a lead capture page (e.g., a contact form or a page explaining eligibility).\n*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n    *   **Pass:** The hero headline is correct, and the \"Get Started\" button navigates to the expected page.\n    *   **Fail:** The hero headline is incorrect, or the \"Get Started\" button is not clickable or does not navigate to the expected page.\n\n## 5. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents\n\nThese instructions are critical for guiding the autonomous agents in efficiently finding and interacting with the relevant elements on the page.\n\n*   **Prioritize Homepage Elements:** Focus on identifying and interacting with elements within the main content area of the homepage first.\n*   **Headline Identification:** The agent should use a combination of HTML tag analysis (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`) and text content matching to locate the hero headline.  The agent should be able to extract the text within the H1 or H2 tag and verify it matches our criteria.\n*   **Button Identification:**  The agent should use a combination of HTML tag analysis (e.g., `<button>`, `<a>` with `role=\"button\"`) and text content matching (\"Get Started\") to locate the \"Get Started\" button. Prioritize buttons prominently displayed on the homepage, especially near the hero section.  The agent must be able to click the button.\n*   **Navigation Menu Identification:** The agent should look for standard navigation patterns (e.g., a `<nav>` element with `<ul>` and `<li>` elements containing links). Use `aria-label` attributes to correctly identify the main navigation.\n*   **Dynamic Content Handling:** Be prepared for potential A/B testing scenarios where the hero headline or button placement might change. The agent should be robust enough to handle minor variations in element positioning or wording. Implement retry logic with short delays for elements that might load asynchronously.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to capture any exceptions during element identification or interaction.  Log these errors with sufficient context (e.g., URL, element XPath, error message).\n\n## 6. Test Environment\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest version)\n*   **Operating System:** Platform agnostic (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n## 7. Reporting\n\n*   All test results will be logged, including pass/fail status, screenshots (on failure), and any error messages.\n*   A summary report will be generated at the end of the smoke test execution, highlighting any failed test cases.\n\n## 8. Exit Criteria\n\n*   All smoke test cases must pass to consider the build stable for further testing.\n*   If any smoke test case fails, the build should be considered unstable and further testing should be halted until the issue is resolved.\n\n## 9. Future Considerations\n\n*   Expand the smoke suite to include more critical user flows and key pages.\n*   Incorporate accessibility testing into the smoke suite.\n*   Add performance metrics to the smoke tests.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for smoke testing the Omada Health website. By following these guidelines, autonomous agents can efficiently and effectively validate the core functionality of the site."
