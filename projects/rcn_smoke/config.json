  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Strategy document tailored for Astound's \"My Account\" portal, focusing on regression testing as requested. This document aims to provide a clear blueprint for the engineering team.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Astound \"My Account\" Portal (Regression)\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target URL:** `https://my.astound.com/login`\n**Business Domain:** ISP/Telecom\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1. Domain Analysis: ISP/Telecom \"My Account\" Portal\n\nThe \"My Account\" portal is a critical component of Astound's customer relationship management (CRM).  Its primary purpose is to allow customers to self-manage their accounts, services, and billing.  The key functionalities within the portal drive customer satisfaction, reduce support costs, and enable revenue generation (e.g., through add-on services).\n\n**Critical Flows (P0 - Highest Priority):**\n\n*   **Login/Authentication:**  Access to the portal.\n*   **Billing Information:**  Viewing statements, understanding charges.\n*   **Payment Processing:**  Making payments, managing payment methods.\n\n**Secondary Flows (P1):**\n\n*   **Service Management:**  Upgrading/downgrading services.\n*   **Profile Management:** Updating contact information.\n*   **Notification Management:**  Enabling/disabling SMS/Email notifications.\n\n### 1.2. Risk Profile\n\nFailure of the \"My Account\" portal can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process payments, leading to delayed revenue collection and potential customer churn. Incorrect billing information leading to disputes and refunds.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative customer experiences leading to loss of trust and brand damage.  Public complaints and negative reviews.\n*   **Data Breach (Security Risk):** Compromised customer data, leading to legal and financial penalties. This is a critical concern given the sensitive information stored within the portal.\n*   **Increased Support Costs:**  Inability to self-serve forces customers to contact support, increasing operational expenses.\n\n### 1.3. Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities accessible through the \"My Account\" portal, specifically focusing on:\n    *   Login and Authentication\n    *   Billing and Payment Management\n    *   Profile and Contact Information Management\n    *   Service Management\n    *   Notification Preferences\n*   Regression testing of existing features to ensure continued functionality after code changes.\n*   Security testing for common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions).\n*   Mobile responsiveness testing (simulated on various screen sizes).\n*   API testing for underlying services that support the portal.\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Performance testing (load, stress, and endurance testing) - should be covered separately.\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - needs a dedicated strategy.\n*   Testing of third-party integrations outside the \"My Account\" portal's immediate dependencies.\n*   Database migration testing (covered under separate data governance).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1. Smoke Suite (Sanity - Build Verification Test)\n\n*   **Purpose:** Quick health check to verify the core functionality is working after each build.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Login Success:** Using valid credentials (`vishvas.mca@gmail.com`, `Myaccount@123`). Verification: Successful login, redirection to the main dashboard/account summary page.\n    2.  **Billing Page Load:** Navigate to the billing section. Verification: The billing page loads without errors and displays basic account information.\n*   **Execution Frequency:** After every build deployment to the test environment.\n\n### 2.2. Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThis suite aims to cover all critical functionalities with comprehensive testing.\n\n*   **Login/Authentication:**\n    *   **Positive:** Valid credentials.\n    *   **Negative:** Invalid username, invalid password, locked account, expired password.\n    *   **Edge Cases:** Concurrent login attempts from different browsers, handling of session timeouts.\n    *   **Security:** Brute-force attack prevention, password complexity requirements.\n*   **Billing Information:**\n    *   **Positive:** View current bill, view past bills.\n    *   **Negative:** Incorrect date range selection, missing bill data.\n    *   **Edge Cases:** Display of large bills, handling of partial payments, disputed charges.\n    *   **Security:** Verify sensitive data is masked appropriately, prevent unauthorized access to billing details.\n*   **Payment Processing:**\n    *   **Positive:** Successful payment with valid credit card, adding/deleting payment methods.\n    *   **Negative:** Invalid credit card number, expired card, insufficient funds, payment gateway errors.\n    *   **Edge Cases:** Handling of failed transactions, partial payments, recurring payment setup/cancellation.\n    *   **Security:** PCI DSS compliance, encryption of payment data.\n*   **Profile Management:**\n     *   **Positive:** Successful update of profile information (address, phone number).\n     *   **Negative:** Invalid address format, incorrect phone number format.\n*   **Notification Management:**\n    *   **Positive:** Enable/disable SMS notifications. Verification: Changes are saved and reflected in the system.\n\n*   **Security Testing (OWASP Top 10 - Basics):**\n    *   **Input Validation:**  Test all input fields for SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other injection vulnerabilities.\n    *   **Authentication:**  Test for weak passwords, session management issues, and unauthorized access.\n\n### 2.3. Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data Segregation**: Dedicated test accounts MUST be used, never production data.\n*   **Static Test Data**: Use a set of pre-defined test accounts with varying scenarios (e.g., different service levels, payment histories). These should be documented and maintained.\n*   **Dynamic Test Data Generation**: For scenarios requiring unique data (e.g., new credit card numbers), use data generation libraries/tools to create valid, but non-sensitive, data on the fly.  Consider using masked test cards.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1. Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to represent each page of the \"My Account\" portal as a separate class. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and reduces test duplication.\n*   **Technology Stack**:  Recommend a robust and widely adopted technology stack:\n    *   **Language**: Java/Kotlin or Python.\n    *   **Testing Framework**: JUnit/TestNG (Java) or pytest (Python).\n    *   **Web Driver**: Selenium WebDriver or Playwright.\n    *   **Assertion Library**: AssertJ (Java) or Pytest-Assert (Python).\n*   **Reporting**: Use a reporting tool to generate comprehensive test reports (e.g., Allure Report).\n*   **Configuration Management**: Store configuration settings (e.g., URLs, credentials) in a separate configuration file.\n\n### 3.2. Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions (Retry Mechanism):**  Use polling assertions (e.g., with Awaitility or similar libraries) to handle asynchronous operations and potential timing issues. Instead of failing immediately, retry the assertion for a specified duration.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits in Selenium/Playwright to wait for specific elements to be present or visible before interacting with them.  Avoid implicit waits, as they can lead to unpredictable behavior.\n*   **Self-Healing (Limited Scope):** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms.  For example, if an element is not found due to a minor UI change, attempt to locate it using alternative locators (e.g., by text, by label).  *Note:  Self-healing should be used cautiously and should not mask underlying application issues.*\n*   **Screenshot and Video Recording**:  Capture screenshots and videos of failing tests to aid in debugging and root cause analysis.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1. Mining Targets (Initial Exploration)\n\nPrioritize exploration of the following areas using the autonomous agent:\n\n1.  **Login Page (`/login`):**  Explore different login scenarios (valid/invalid credentials, forgotten password).\n2.  **Account Summary/Dashboard:**  Verify the display of key account information (balance, service status).\n3.  **Billing Page:** Explore all sections of the billing page (current bill, past bills, payment history).\n4.  **Payment Methods:** Add, edit, and delete payment methods.\n5.  **SMS Notification Settings:** Enable, disable, and verify the functionality of SMS notifications.\n\n### 4.2. Verification Criteria\n\n*   **General Success Criteria:**\n    *   HTTP Status Code: 200 OK (for successful page loads).\n    *   Expected Content: Verify the presence of key elements and text on the page (e.g., \"Welcome, [Username]\", \"Billing Statement\", \"Payment History\").\n    *   No JavaScript Errors:  Check the browser console for JavaScript errors.\n\n*   **Specific Success Criteria Examples:**\n    *   **Login Success:**  Redirection to the account summary page and display of the user's name.\n    *   **Payment Success:**  Confirmation message indicating successful payment and an updated account balance.\n    *   **SMS Notification Enabled:** Confirmation message indicating successful setting of SMS notification, and SMS received within acceptable timeframe.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the Astound \"My Account\" portal. It should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the application and the evolving threat landscape."
