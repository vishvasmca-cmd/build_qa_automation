  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Office.com Smoke Test\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Office.com smoke test, ensuring the core functionality is operational before further testing and development efforts are invested. This strategy will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable test suite.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain**: Office.com is a critical web application providing access to essential productivity tools. Failure to access the site or core functionalities can disrupt user workflows and impact business operations.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile**:\n    *   **High**: Inability to access the website or login can lead to significant user frustration and productivity loss.\n    *   **Medium**: Failure of key buttons or links to load correctly can hinder user navigation and access to essential features.\n*   **Define Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website launch and successful loading of the homepage.\n        *   Identification of the Login button/link and its presence on the page.\n        *   Identification of Signup/Get Started button/link and its presence on the page.\n        *   Identification of \"Try for Free\" button/link and its presence on the page.\n        *   Identification of any 5 buttons on the page.\n        *   Identification of any 2 links on the page.\n        *   Identification of any 2 menu bars on the page.\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Clicking on any buttons, links, or menu items.\n        *   Login functionality verification.\n        *   Signup/Get Started process verification.\n        *   \"Try for Free\" process verification.\n        *   Detailed content validation.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially).\n        *   Mobile device testing (initially).\n        *   Error handling.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Website Launch**: Verify the Office.com homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element**: Verify the \"Login\" button/link is present and visible.\n        3.  **Signup Element**: Verify the \"Signup\" or \"Get Started\" button/link is present and visible.\n        4.  **Try for Free Element**: Verify the \"Try for Free\" button/link is present and visible.\n        5.  **Button Count**: Verify at least 5 buttons are present on the page.\n        6.  **Link Count**: Verify at least 2 links are present on the page.\n        7.  **Menu Bar Count**: Verify at least 2 menu bars are present on the page.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**: _Not applicable for a smoke test._  Regression testing will be defined in a separate strategy document.\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   **Static Data**: No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence, not data input or validation.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   Implement a Page Object Model (POM) structure. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n    *   Create a `HomePage` Page Object containing locators and methods for identifying the target elements (Login, Signup, buttons, links, menu bars).\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., `waitForElementVisible`) to handle potential loading delays.  Set reasonable timeouts (e.g., 5-10 seconds).\n    *   **Locator Strategy**: Prioritize robust locators (e.g., `data-testid`, `aria-label`) over fragile locators (e.g., XPath based on position).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for initial page load failures (e.g., retry the page load up to 3 times).\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    1.  **Office.com Homepage**: Focus on the main landing page after the website loads.\n    2.  **Header/Navigation Bar**: Inspect the header for Login, Signup, and menu elements.\n    3.  **Footer**: Inspect the footer for links and buttons.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Website Launch**: HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the main page title.\n    *   **Element Presence**: The target elements (Login, Signup, buttons, links, menu bars) must be visible on the page.\n    *   **Element Identification**:  The test should accurately identify the specified number of buttons, links, and menu bars.\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed test cases, including screenshots and relevant logs.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the Office.com smoke test. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a stable and reliable testing process."
