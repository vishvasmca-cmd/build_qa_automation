  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Instagram Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Strategy for the Instagram website smoke test. It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests to ensure the core functionality of the application is operational.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Analyze the Domain:** Instagram is a social media platform. A failure in core functionality (login, signup) directly impacts user access and engagement, leading to potential user churn and brand damage.\n*   **Determine Risk Profile:** High. Failure of core functionalities can lead to significant user dissatisfaction, negative publicity, and potential loss of advertising revenue.\n*   **Define Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading of the homepage.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of the Login button/link.\n        *   Presence and accessibility of Signup/Get Started/Try for Free (or similar) buttons/links (at least 5).\n        *   Presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Functionality of the buttons/links (clicking, navigation).\n        *   Detailed UI/UX validation (colors, fonts, responsiveness).\n        *   Error handling or negative testing.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (initially, focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile testing.\n        *   API testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the Instagram website is accessible and the basic elements required for user interaction are present.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the Instagram homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n        3.  **Signup Elements:** Verify the presence of at least 5 \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" or \"Try for Free\" (or similar) buttons/links.\n        4.  **Link Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        5.  **Menu Bar Presence:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** (Not applicable for this smoke test strategy)\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   This smoke test does not require any user data. The tests focus solely on the presence of elements. Therefore, a static data strategy is sufficient (no data needed).\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure. Create a `HomePage` object that encapsulates the locators and interactions related to the Instagram homepage. This will improve maintainability and reusability of the test code.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to handle potential delays in element loading. This will reduce flakiness caused by timing issues. Example: Wait up to 5 seconds for the Login button to be present before asserting its existence.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test execution. If a test fails due to a transient issue (e.g., network glitch), retry the test a limited number of times before marking it as a failure.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (https://instagram.com):** This is the primary target. The autonomous agent should focus on identifying the elements specified in the \"In Scope\" section.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Load:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and presence of the Instagram logo or a unique homepage element.\n    *   **Login Element:** Presence of an element with text or attribute containing \"Login\" (case-insensitive).\n    *   **Signup Elements:** Presence of at least 5 elements with text or attribute containing \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" \"Try for Free,\" or similar (case-insensitive).\n    *   **Link Presence:** Presence of at least 2 `<a>` tags on the homepage.\n    *   **Menu Bar Presence:** Presence of at least 2 `<nav>` or `<ul>` tags with appropriate CSS classes indicating menu bars.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear and concise plan for executing the Instagram smoke test. Adherence to this strategy will ensure the core functionality of the application is verified quickly and efficiently."
