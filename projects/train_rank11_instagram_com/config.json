  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Instagram Smoke Test\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** AI Test Strategist\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for a smoke test of Instagram's website (https://instagram.com). It serves as a blueprint for the engineering team, guiding the development and execution of automated tests.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** Instagram is a social media platform. Failure of core functionalities can lead to user dissatisfaction, loss of engagement, and potential reputational damage.\n*   **Risk Profile:** A critical failure (e.g., login failure) directly impacts user access and platform usability. A less critical failure (e.g., button not visible) impacts user experience.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and successful loading.\n        *   Identification of Login functionality.\n        *   Identification of Signup/Get Started/Try for Free (or similar) buttons (at least 5).\n        *   Identification of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        *   Identification of at least 2 menu bars (without clicking).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Clicking any buttons or links.\n        *   Navigation beyond the homepage.\n        *   User authentication (login/signup).\n        *   Functionality of menu items.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n        *   Mobile responsiveness.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   API testing.\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the basic health and accessibility of the Instagram website.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Load:** Verify the Instagram homepage loads successfully.\n        2.  **Login Element:** Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button or link.\n        3.  **Signup Elements:** Verify the presence of at least 5 \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" \"Try for Free,\" or similar call-to-action buttons.\n        4.  **Link Verification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 links on the homepage.\n        5.  **Menu Bar Verification:** Verify the presence of at least 2 menu bars on the homepage.\n*   **Regression Suite:** *Not applicable for this smoke test.* A regression suite would be defined later to cover deeper functionality and edge cases.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   This smoke test does not require any user data. The focus is on element presence and website load.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the Instagram homepage. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   `HomePage.java`: Contains locators and methods for interacting with elements on the homepage (e.g., `getLoginButton()`, `getSignupButtons()`, `getLinks()`, `getMenuBars()`).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`) to handle potential loading delays. This prevents tests from failing due to elements not being immediately available.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for test execution in case of intermittent network issues.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Instagram Homepage (https://instagram.com):** This is the primary target for element identification.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    1.  **Website Load:** HTTP status code 200 (OK) and the presence of the Instagram logo or a unique homepage element.\n    2.  **Login Element:** The \"Login\" button or link is visible and enabled.\n    3.  **Signup Elements:** At least 5 \"Signup,\" \"Get Started,\" \"Try for Free,\" or similar call-to-action buttons are visible.\n    4.  **Link Verification:** At least 2 links are visible on the homepage.\n    5.  **Menu Bar Verification:** At least 2 menu bars are visible on the homepage.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Clear and concise test reports indicating pass/fail status for each test case.\n    *   Detailed error messages for failed test cases, including screenshots or videos if possible.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for the Instagram smoke test. Adherence to these guidelines will ensure a robust and reliable testing process."
