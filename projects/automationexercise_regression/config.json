  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for AutomationExercise.com, an e-commerce platform. It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding test automation efforts and ensuring comprehensive test coverage.\n\n### 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** AutomationExercise.com is an e-commerce platform. The most critical areas are those directly impacting revenue generation and customer experience, such as product browsing, adding to cart, and checkout.\n*   **Risk Profile:** System failures can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Lost sales due to checkout errors or inability to add items to cart.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:** Negative customer reviews and loss of trust due to website malfunctions.\n    *   **Data Security Breaches:** Potential compromise of customer data (payment information, personal details) if security vulnerabilities exist.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All functionalities related to user registration, login, product browsing, adding to cart, checkout, payment processing, and order management.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest two versions).\n        *   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n        *   Basic security checks (input validation, protection against common web vulnerabilities).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).  (Separate initiative)\n        *   Advanced security penetration testing. (Separate initiative)\n        *   Integration with third-party services beyond basic payment gateway functionality.\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance). (Separate initiative)\n        *   Detailed API testing (focus on UI-driven testing initially).\n\n### 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Goal:** Verify the core functionality of the application after each build deployment.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  Navigate to the homepage and verify the page loads successfully.\n        2.  Register a new user account (happy path).\n        3.  Log in with the newly created user account.\n        4.  Search for a product.\n        5.  Add a product to the cart.\n        6.  Proceed to checkout as a registered user.\n        7.  Complete a purchase using a test payment method (e.g., a pre-configured test credit card).\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After each build deployment to any environment.\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Goal:** Ensure that new changes haven't introduced regressions and that existing functionality remains intact.\n    *   **Test Categories:**\n        *   **Functional Testing:**\n            *   **Positive Testing:** Valid inputs and expected outcomes for all features.\n            *   **Negative Testing:** Invalid inputs, boundary values, and error handling. Examples:\n                *   Invalid email format during registration.\n                *   Password reset with an invalid email address.\n                *   Adding more items to the cart than available in stock.\n                *   Applying an expired or invalid coupon code.\n            *   **Edge Cases:**\n                *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n                *   Network failures: Simulate network interruptions during checkout.\n                *   Empty states: Verify handling of empty cart, empty search results, etc.\n        *   **Security Testing:**\n            *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks:\n                *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).\n                *   Ensure sensitive data (passwords, credit card details) are properly encrypted.\n        *   **UI/UX Testing:**\n            *   Cross-browser compatibility: Verify consistent rendering and functionality across different browsers.\n            *   Responsiveness: Ensure the website adapts correctly to different screen sizes.\n            *   Validation Messages: Verify all validation messages are displayed correctly.\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** At least once per sprint, and before each major release.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:** Pre-defined user accounts, product catalogs, and payment methods for smoke tests and basic regression scenarios.  Stored in a secure, version-controlled repository.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:** Dynamically generated data for negative testing and edge cases (e.g., random email addresses, coupon codes, quantities).  Generated using data generation libraries.\n    *   **Data Management:** Implement a data cleanup strategy to avoid data pollution in test environments.\n\n### 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page of the application should have a corresponding page object that encapsulates the elements and actions on that page.\n    *   **Language:** [Choose a language - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript] based on team expertise and project requirements.\n    *   **Test Framework:** [Choose a framework - e.g., Selenium WebDriver, Cypress, Playwright] based on the application's technology stack and testing needs.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions with appropriate timeouts to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with the test.\n        *   **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry mechanisms for failed test steps due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n    *   **Self-Healing:**\n        *   Implement mechanisms to automatically locate elements based on multiple locators (e.g., ID, XPath, CSS selector) to handle changes in the UI.\n        *   Use relative locators to find elements based on their proximity to other elements.\n\n### 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Initial Exploration):**\n    1.  **Homepage:** Verify the layout, navigation, and key elements (e.g., banners, featured products) are displayed correctly.\n    2.  **Product Listing Page:** Explore different product categories, filters, and sorting options.\n    3.  **Product Details Page:** Verify product information, images, and add-to-cart functionality.\n    4.  **Shopping Cart Page:** Verify cart summary, quantity updates, and checkout button.\n    5.  **Checkout Page:** Explore different shipping and payment options.\n    6.  **Registration/Login Pages:** Test the registration and login flows.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Success:**\n        *   HTTP 200 status code for all page requests.\n        *   Expected elements are visible on the page (e.g., product name, price, image).\n        *   Validation messages are displayed correctly for invalid inputs.\n        *   Successful completion of key actions (e.g., adding to cart, completing a purchase).\n    *   **Failure:**\n        *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n        *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n        *   Incorrect data or calculations.\n        *   Broken links or images.\n        *   Security vulnerabilities.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the AutomationExercise.com platform.\n"
