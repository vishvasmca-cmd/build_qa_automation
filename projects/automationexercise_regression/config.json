  "master_plan": "Okay, here's the Master Test Strategy document for Automation Exercise, focusing on regression testing and laying the groundwork for autonomous smoke tests.\n\n# Master Test Strategy: Automation Exercise E-commerce Platform\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Target Application:** https://www.automationexercise.com/\n**Business Domain:** E-commerce\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** E-commerce platforms are highly business-critical. Core functionalities like product browsing, adding to cart, and checkout directly impact revenue. Downtime or defects in these areas can lead to immediate financial loss and damage to brand reputation.\n*   **Risk Profile:**\n    *   **Financial Loss:** Defects in checkout or payment processing can directly lead to lost sales.\n    *   **Data Breach:** Security vulnerabilities could expose customer data (payment information, personal details), leading to legal and reputational damage.\n    *   **Trust Loss:** A buggy or unreliable platform erodes customer trust and drives them to competitors.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All functionalities of the website, including:\n            *   Authentication (Login, Registration, Password Management)\n            *   Product Catalog (Browsing, Searching, Filtering, Sorting)\n            *   Shopping Cart (Adding, Updating, Removing Items)\n            *   Checkout & Payments (Order Placement, Payment Processing, Coupon Application, Address Management)\n            *   User Profile Management\n            *   Contact Us Form\n            *   API endpoints related to the above functionalities (if applicable and accessible)\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest versions)\n        *   Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)\n        *   Basic security checks (input validation, protection against common web vulnerabilities)\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Performance testing (load, stress, endurance) - to be addressed in a separate strategy.\n        *   Detailed security penetration testing - to be addressed by a dedicated security team.\n        *   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - to be addressed in a separate strategy.\n        *   Third-party integrations (e.g., payment gateways) beyond basic functional verification.  We will verify that the integration *works*, but not deeply test the 3rd party service itself.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Purpose:**  A quick health check to ensure the core system is operational after each build.\n    *   **Execution Frequency:** After every build deployment to any environment.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        *   Verify Home Page Loads Successfully (HTTP 200, key elements visible)\n        *   User Login with Valid Credentials\n        *   Browse a Product and View Details\n        *   Add a Product to Cart\n        *   Initiate Checkout Process\n*   **Regression Suite (Deep Dive):**\n    *   **Purpose:**  Comprehensive testing to ensure existing functionality remains intact after changes.\n    *   **Execution Frequency:**  Nightly, after major code merges, and before releases.\n    *   **Test Areas:**\n        *   **Authentication:**\n            *   Login with Invalid Password/Username\n            *   Password Reset Flow (Request, Verification, Update)\n            *   Registration with Existing Email\n            *   Account Lockout after multiple failed login attempts\n        *   **Product Catalog:**\n            *   Filter products by Price, Category, Brand, etc.\n            *   Sort products (Price Low-High, High-Low, Newest)\n            *   Search for non-existent product (verify appropriate message)\n            *   Verify Pagination and correct product display on each page\n        *   **Shopping Cart:**\n            *   Update Quantity in Cart (increase, decrease, set to zero)\n            *   Remove Item from Cart\n            *   Add Out-of-Stock Item (verify appropriate error message)\n            *   Cart Persistence (verify cart contents are maintained after page refresh/session expiry)\n            *   Verify cart total updates correctly with quantity changes\n        *   **Checkout & Payments:**\n            *   Checkout with different address formats (valid and invalid)\n            *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code (verify discount calculation)\n            *   Simulate Payment Decline (using test payment credentials)\n            *   Verify Tax and Shipping calculations are accurate\n            *   Test different payment methods (if applicable)\n            *   Guest Checkout vs. Registered User Checkout\n        *   **Negative Testing:**\n            *   Input validation on all forms (e.g., invalid email format, special characters in name fields, excessively long text)\n            *   Boundary value testing (e.g., minimum/maximum quantity allowed in cart)\n            *   Error handling for network failures (e.g., simulate a dropped connection during checkout)\n            *   Handling of empty states (e.g., empty search results, empty cart)\n        *   **Edge Cases:**\n            *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding/removing items from the same product simultaneously.\n            *   Large Cart: Adding a very large number of items to the cart.\n            *   Long Product Names/Descriptions: Handling of extremely long text strings.\n        *   **Security:**\n            *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks:\n                *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.  Focus on form fields and URL parameters.\n                *   Verify sensitive data (passwords, credit card details) are encrypted in transit and at rest.\n*   **Data Strategy:**\n    *   **Test Data:** A mix of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n        *   **Static Data:**  A set of pre-defined user accounts (with different roles/permissions), product data, and coupon codes will be maintained.\n        *   **Dynamic Data:**  Randomly generated data (e.g., email addresses, names, addresses) will be used to avoid conflicts and ensure uniqueness.  Faker libraries are recommended.\n    *   **Data Management:**  Test data will be stored in a centralized repository (e.g., a database or CSV files) and managed using a data management tool.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):**  This design pattern promotes maintainability and reusability by encapsulating page elements and interactions within dedicated page object classes.\n    *   **Language:**  [Choose a language - Python, Java, JavaScript].  Python is often favored for its readability and extensive libraries.\n    *   **Libraries/Tools:**\n        *   **Selenium:**  For browser automation.\n        *   **pytest (Python) / JUnit (Java) / Mocha (JavaScript):**  For test execution and reporting.\n        *   **Requests (Python) / RestAssured (Java) / Axios (JavaScript):** For API testing (if applicable).\n        *   **Faker:** For generating realistic test data.\n        *   **Allure:** For generating comprehensive test reports.\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Flakiness Handling:**\n        *   **Explicit Waits:** Use explicit waits (e.g., `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or interactable before attempting to interact with them.  Avoid implicit waits.\n        *   **Polling Assertions:**  Implement retry mechanisms with short delays to handle intermittent issues (e.g., network latency).  Use libraries like `retrying` (Python).\n        *   **Self-Healing:**  Implement mechanisms to automatically recover from common errors (e.g., re-login if a session expires, re-try a failed action).\n    *   **Test Environment Stability:**\n        *   Ensure the test environment is stable and representative of the production environment.\n        *   Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to create consistent and reproducible test environments.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Initial Exploration for Autonomous Testing):**\n    *   **Homepage:** Verify all main navigation links are functional and lead to the correct pages.\n    *   **Product Listing Page:** Explore different product categories and verify product display.\n    *   **Product Detail Page:**  Verify product information (name, price, description, images) is displayed correctly.\n    *   **Login/Registration Pages:**  Attempt to create new accounts and log in with existing accounts.\n    *   **Cart Page:** Add products to the cart and verify the cart contents.\n    *   **Checkout Page:**  Attempt to proceed through the checkout process (without completing the purchase).\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:**  Verify that all requests return the expected HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK for successful requests, 404 Not Found for missing resources).\n    *   **Element Visibility:**  Verify that key elements (e.g., headings, buttons, form fields) are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:**  Verify that specific text strings are present on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, product name on the product detail page).\n    *   **Functional Verification:**  Verify that actions (e.g., clicking a button, submitting a form) perform the expected behavior.\n    *   **Error Message Verification:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or unexpected conditions.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for testing the Automation Exercise e-commerce platform. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, focusing on critical functionalities and potential vulnerabilities. By following this strategy, the engineering team can ensure the quality and reliability of the platform, protecting the business from financial loss and reputational damage.\n"
