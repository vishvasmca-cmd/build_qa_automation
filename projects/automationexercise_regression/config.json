It serves as a blueprint for the entire engineering team, guiding test automation efforts and ensuring comprehensive test coverage.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\nAutomationExercise.com operates within the e-commerce domain. Key functionalities include product browsing, shopping cart management, checkout, and user account management. The checkout process is considered P0 (highest priority) due to its direct impact on revenue generation.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\nSystem failures can result in:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Failed transactions, incorrect pricing, lost orders.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative customer experiences, loss of trust.\n*   **Data Security Breaches:** Compromised user data, payment information leaks.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All functionalities related to user registration, login, product catalog browsing, shopping cart management, checkout, payment processing, order management, and basic account management.\n*   API testing for core functionalities.\n*   UI testing across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Security testing for common vulnerabilities.\n*   Performance testing for critical paths (e.g., homepage load, product search, checkout).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Detailed performance testing beyond basic load checks.\n*   Mobile application testing (unless explicitly stated).\n*   Accessibility testing (initial phase, will be incorporated later).\n*   Detailed integration with third-party services (focus on core payment gateway).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe smoke suite provides a rapid health check of the application.\n\n*   **Frequency:** Executed after every build deployment.\n*   **Goal:** Verify core functionality is operational.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    *   Verify Homepage Loads Successfully (HTTP 200 OK)\n    *   User Login with Valid Credentials\n    *   Browse Product Catalog\n    *   Add Item to Cart\n    *   Initiate Checkout Process\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe regression suite ensures existing functionality remains intact after changes.\n\n*   **Frequency:** Executed on a scheduled basis (e.g., nightly) and before major releases.\n*   **Goal:** Detect regressions and ensure comprehensive test coverage.\n*   **Test Areas:**\n\n    *   **Authentication:**\n        *   Login with Invalid Password\n        *   Login with Locked Account\n        *   Password Reset Flow\n        *   Registration with Existing Email\n    *   **Product Catalog:**\n        *   Filter products by Price/Category\n        *   Sort products (Price Low-High)\n        *   Search for non-existent product\n        *   Verify Pagination\n    *   **Shopping Cart:**\n        *   Update Quantity in Cart\n        *   Remove Item from Cart\n        *   Add Out-of-Stock Item (Verify Error)\n        *   Cart Persistence (Refresh Page)\n    *   **Checkout & Payments:**\n        *   Checkout with formatted Address\n        *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code\n        *   Payment Decline Simulation\n        *   Calculate Tax/Shipping correctly\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Invalid input in all forms (e.g., special characters, exceeding field lengths).\n        *   Boundary value testing (e.g., minimum/maximum quantities, price ranges).\n        *   Timeout scenarios (e.g., simulate slow network connections).\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency testing (multiple users accessing the same product/cart).\n        *   Network failures during checkout.\n        *   Empty states (e.g., empty cart, no search results).\n    *   **Security:**\n        *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks:\n            *   Input validation to prevent SQL injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n            *   Ensure sensitive data (passwords, credit card information) is encrypted in transit and at rest.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data Source:** A combination of static and dynamically generated data will be used.\n*   **Static Data:**  A set of pre-defined user accounts (valid/invalid), product data, and coupon codes will be maintained.\n*   **Dynamic Data:**  Data will be generated programmatically for scenarios requiring unique values (e.g., email addresses, order IDs).  Faker libraries will be used for realistic data generation.\n*   **Data Management:**  Test data will be stored in a secure and version-controlled repository.  Sensitive data will be masked or anonymized.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):**  Implement a POM structure to improve test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Each page or component of the application should have a corresponding page object.\n*   **Language:**  [Choose appropriate language based on team expertise - e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript]\n*   **Test Framework:** [Choose appropriate framework based on language - e.g., JUnit, pytest, Mocha]\n*   **Assertion Library:** [Choose appropriate library based on language - e.g., AssertJ, Chai]\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:**  Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and dynamic content loading.  Avoid hardcoded waits.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common test failures (e.g., retrying failed assertions, re-locating elements).\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  Limit the number of retries to avoid masking genuine issues.\n*   **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to capture detailed information about test execution, including errors, warnings, and debug messages.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploration of the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify layout, navigation, and key elements.\n2.  **Product Listing Page (Category Pages):** Verify product display, filtering, and sorting.\n3.  **Product Detail Page:** Verify product information, image display, and \"Add to Cart\" functionality.\n4.  **Shopping Cart Page:** Verify cart contents, quantity updates, and checkout initiation.\n5.  **Checkout Pages (Address, Delivery, Payment):** Verify form validation, payment options, and order confirmation.\n6.  **Login/Registration Pages:** Verify form validation and account creation/login processes.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\n*   **Success:**\n    *   HTTP 200 OK status code for all page requests.\n    *   Expected elements are visible on the page (e.g., product name, price, \"Add to Cart\" button).\n    *   Form validation errors are displayed correctly for invalid input.\n    *   Successful login redirects to the user's account page.\n    *   Successful checkout displays an order confirmation page.\n*   **Failure:**\n    *   HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).\n    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.\n    *   Missing or incorrect elements on the page.\n    *   Form validation failures for valid input.\n    *   Inability to complete critical flows (e.g., login, checkout).\n```"
