  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: AutomationExercise.com\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Prepared By:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for AutomationExercise.com, an e-commerce platform. It provides a comprehensive plan for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application through a robust testing approach, focusing on regression testing and laying the foundation for future autonomous exploration.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n### 1.1 Domain Analysis\n\nAutomationExercise.com operates within the e-commerce domain. Key business functionalities include:\n\n*   **Product Catalog:** Displaying and managing products.\n*   **User Authentication:** Securely managing user accounts.\n*   **Shopping Cart:** Enabling users to add and manage items for purchase.\n*   **Checkout & Payments:** Processing orders and payments securely.\n*   **Order Management:** Tracking and managing orders.\n\nThe **Checkout & Payments** module is considered **P0 (Critical)** due to its direct impact on revenue generation. Failure in this area will result in immediate financial loss. **Authentication** and **Shopping Cart** are also considered **High** criticality.\n\n### 1.2 Risk Profile\n\nFailure of AutomationExercise.com can lead to:\n\n*   **Financial Loss:** Inability to process orders, lost sales, and potential chargebacks.\n*   **Reputational Damage:** Negative customer reviews, loss of trust, and brand erosion.\n*   **Data Breach:** Compromised user data (e.g., credit card information, personal details) leading to legal and financial repercussions.\n*   **Operational Disruption:** Inability to fulfill orders, impacting customer satisfaction and logistics.\n\n### 1.3 Testing Scope\n\n**In Scope:**\n\n*   All modules listed in the Domain Analysis (Product Catalog, User Authentication, Shopping Cart, Checkout & Payments, Order Management).\n*   Functional testing of all features within these modules.\n*   Regression testing to ensure existing functionality remains intact after changes.\n*   Negative testing to validate error handling and system resilience.\n*   Security testing for basic vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).\n*   Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*   Performance testing (load times, responsiveness).\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n\n*   Mobile app testing (unless explicitly stated).\n*   Detailed performance testing (e.g., stress testing, endurance testing) - to be considered in a separate phase.\n*   Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance) - to be considered in a separate phase.\n*   Localization testing (unless explicitly stated).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Smoke Suite (Sanity)\n\nThe Smoke Suite will serve as the initial \"Health Check\" for each build. It will be executed after each deployment to ensure the core functionality is operational.\n\n*   **Login:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.\n*   **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads correctly and key elements (e.g., navigation menu, featured products) are displayed.\n*   **Product View:** Verify a product detail page loads correctly.\n*   **Add to Cart:** Verify a product can be added to the cart.\n*   **Checkout (Guest):** Verify a guest user can complete a purchase with a valid payment method.\n\n### 2.2 Regression Suite (Deep Dive)\n\nThe Regression Suite will provide comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.\n\n*   **Negative Testing:**\n    *   Invalid login attempts (incorrect password, locked account).\n    *   Invalid coupon codes.\n    *   Submitting forms with missing or invalid data.\n    *   Attempting to add out-of-stock items to the cart.\n*   **Edge Cases:**\n    *   Concurrency: Multiple users adding the same item to the cart simultaneously.\n    *   Network failures: Simulating network interruptions during checkout.\n    *   Empty states: Handling empty cart, no search results, etc.\n    *   Large datasets: Testing with a large number of products or users.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Basic OWASP Top 10 checks: Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.\n    *   Password complexity requirements.\n    *   Secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., credit card information).\n*   **Module Specific Regression Examples:**\n    *   **Authentication:** Password reset flow, registration with existing email, account locking.\n    *   **Product Catalog:** Filtering and sorting products, searching for non-existent products, pagination.\n    *   **Shopping Cart:** Updating quantity in cart, removing items, cart persistence, handling out-of-stock items.\n    *   **Checkout & Payments:** Checkout with different address formats, applying valid/invalid coupon codes, simulating payment declines, verifying tax and shipping calculations.\n\n### 2.3 Data Strategy\n\n*   **Test Data:** A combination of static and dynamically generated test data will be used.\n    *   **Static Data:** Predefined user accounts, product catalogs, and payment methods for consistent testing.\n    *   **Dynamic Data:** Generated data for scenarios requiring unique values (e.g., email addresses, order numbers).  Faker libraries will be used for generating realistic data.\n*   **Data Management:** Test data will be stored in a centralized repository (e.g., CSV files, database) for easy access and maintenance.\n*   **Data Security:** Sensitive data (e.g., credit card information) will be masked or encrypted to protect user privacy.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n### 3.1 Framework Recommendation\n\n*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a Page Object Model to improve code maintainability and reusability. Each page of the application will be represented as a separate class, encapsulating its elements and actions.\n*   **Language:** Python with pytest framework.\n*   **Selenium WebDriver:** For browser automation.\n\n### 3.2 Resilience Strategy\n\n*   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., WebDriverWait in Selenium) to handle asynchronous operations and ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.\n*   **Explicit Waits:** Avoid implicit waits and use explicit waits to wait for specific conditions to be met.\n*   **Self-Healing:** Implement basic self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common issues (e.g., element not found, stale element reference). This could involve retrying actions or refreshing the page.\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for failed tests due to transient issues (e.g., network glitches).\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n### 4.1 Mining Targets\n\nThe autonomous agent should prioritize exploring the following pages and flows:\n\n1.  **Homepage:** Verify layout, navigation, and featured products.\n2.  **Product Listing Page:** Explore product categories, filters, and sorting options.\n3.  **Product Detail Page:** Verify product information, images, and add-to-cart functionality.\n4.  **Shopping Cart:** Verify cart contents, quantity updates, and checkout button.\n5.  **Login/Registration Pages:** Explore login and registration forms, error messages, and password reset flow.\n6.  **Checkout Page:** Verify address form, shipping options, payment methods, and order confirmation.\n\n### 4.2 Verification Criteria\n\nSuccess will be defined by the following criteria:\n\n*   **HTTP Status Code:** Verify that all pages return an HTTP 200 (OK) status code.\n*   **Element Visibility:** Verify that key elements are visible on each page (e.g., product name, price, add-to-cart button, login form).\n*   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text is present on each page (e.g., \"Welcome\" message after login, \"Your Cart is Empty\" message when the cart is empty).\n*   **Functional Verification:** Verify that core functionalities are working as expected (e.g., adding items to the cart, completing a purchase).\n*   **Error Handling:** Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or unexpected conditions.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of the application and the business.\n"
