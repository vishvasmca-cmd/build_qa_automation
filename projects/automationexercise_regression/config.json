  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Automation Exercise E-Commerce Platform\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** Senior Test Manager\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Automation Exercise E-Commerce platform, ensuring comprehensive and efficient testing practices. It will guide the engineering team in building a robust and reliable automation framework.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The target URL `https://www.automationexercise.com/` clearly indicates an E-Commerce platform.  Within this domain, the Checkout and Payment processes are deemed *Critical (P0)*, followed by core functionalities like product browsing, adding to cart, and user authentication.\n\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of this system can lead to:\n    *   **Financial Loss:**  Inability to process orders, failed transactions, incorrect tax calculations.\n    *   **Reputational Damage:**  Poor user experience, broken functionality, security vulnerabilities leading to loss of customer trust.\n    *   **Data Breaches:**  Exposure of sensitive customer information (payment details, personal data).\n    *   **Operational Inefficiency:**  Increased support requests, manual workarounds, delayed releases.\n\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   All functionalities visible on the public-facing website.\n        *   User registration, login, and profile management.\n        *   Product catalog browsing, search, and filtering.\n        *   Shopping cart management (add, update, remove).\n        *   Checkout process, including address entry, shipping options, payment methods, and order confirmation.\n        *   Contact Us form submission.\n        *   API endpoints critical to the UI functionality (e.g., product details, cart management, payment processing).\n        *   Responsive design across different screen sizes (desktop, mobile, tablet).\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed performance testing (load, stress, endurance).  *(Note: Basic page load time checks should be included).*\n        *   Backend database testing (beyond data integrity validation through UI).\n        *   3rd party integrations *beyond basic verification* (e.g., detailed payment gateway testing requires separate strategy).\n        *   A/B testing or personalization features (unless explicitly defined as critical).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\nGiven the explicit goal of \"Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements\", the initial focus is on a robust smoke test suite, that can later be expanded into Regression testing.\n\n### **Smoke Suite (Sanity - \"Health Check\")**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To quickly verify the core functionality of the application after deployment or code changes. Should be executable in a minimal amount of time.\n*   **Frequency:** After every build, deployment, or significant code change.\n*   **Test Cases:**\n    1.  **Homepage Load:** Verify the homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200 status code) and core elements (logo, navigation menu) are visible.\n    2.  **User Registration:**  Attempt to register a new user with valid credentials (happy path).\n    3.  **User Login:** Login with valid credentials created in the Registration step.\n    4.  **Product Browse:**  Navigate to a product category and verify product listing is displayed.\n    5.  **Add to Cart:** Add a product to the shopping cart.\n    6.  **Checkout (Guest):**  Proceed to checkout as a guest and verify order summary details (no actual payment).\n    7.  **Contact Us:** Submit the contact us form with valid data and verify success message.\n\n### **Regression Suite (Deep Dive)**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To ensure that new changes haven't introduced regressions into existing functionality.\n*   **Frequency:** Nightly, or triggered by specific code changes related to impacted modules.\n*   **Areas of Focus (beyond the Smoke Suite):**\n\n    *   **Authentication:**\n        *   Login with Invalid Password.\n        *   Login with Locked Account (if applicable).\n        *   Password Reset Flow.\n        *   Registration with Existing Email.\n        *   Logout functionality.\n\n    *   **Product Catalog:**\n        *   Filter products by Price/Category.\n        *   Sort products (Price Low-High).\n        *   Search for a non-existent product (verify \"no results\" message).\n        *   Verify Pagination.\n        *   Verify product details page elements (image, description, price, availability).\n\n    *   **Shopping Cart:**\n        *   Update Quantity in Cart (increase, decrease, zero quantity).\n        *   Remove Item from Cart.\n        *   Add Out-of-Stock Item (Verify Error Message).\n        *   Cart Persistence (verify cart contents are maintained after refreshing the page or logging out/in).\n        *   Validate product price reflected in cart.\n\n    *   **Checkout & Payments:**\n        *   Checkout with different address formats (valid, invalid).\n        *   Apply Valid/Invalid Coupon Code.\n        *   Simulate Payment Decline (if payment gateway allows).\n        *   Verify Tax/Shipping Calculation Accuracy.\n        *   Test different payment methods (if applicable).\n        *   Verify order confirmation page details.\n        *   Test checkout as a registered user.\n\n    *   **Negative Testing:**\n        *   Input validation for all forms (e.g., invalid email formats, special characters, excessively long strings).\n        *   Boundary value testing (e.g., minimum/maximum quantity, price ranges).\n        *   Error handling for various scenarios (e.g., network failures, timeouts, invalid data).\n\n    *   **Edge Cases:**\n        *   Concurrency: Multiple users accessing the same product/cart simultaneously.\n        *   Network Failures: Simulate network interruptions during critical operations (e.g., checkout).\n        *   Empty States: Verify proper handling of empty carts, search results, or product lists.\n\n    *   **Security (OWASP Top 10 Basics):**\n        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Check for basic SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into form fields.\n        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Verify that sensitive information is protected and accessible only to authorized users.\n\n### **Data Strategy**\n\n*   **Test Data:**\n    *   **Static Data:** Use a set of predefined test data for core scenarios (e.g., valid usernames/passwords, product IDs).  Store in configuration files or a database.\n    *   **Dynamic Data Generation:** Generate random data for scenarios requiring unique values (e.g., email addresses, order numbers).  Use libraries like Faker.\n    *   **Data Masking/Anonymization:**  If using production-like data for testing, ensure sensitive information is masked or anonymized to comply with privacy regulations.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:** **Page Object Model (POM)** is highly recommended. This pattern promotes maintainability and reusability by encapsulating page elements and interactions within separate page object classes.\n\n*   **Key Components:**\n    *   **Base Page:**  A base class containing common methods (e.g., navigate to URL, wait for element, get element text).\n    *   **Page Objects:**  Classes representing individual pages or sections of the application.  Each page object should contain:\n        *   Locators for all relevant elements on the page (e.g., input fields, buttons, labels).\n        *   Methods for interacting with those elements (e.g., enter text, click button, get text).\n    *   **Test Cases:**  Classes containing the actual test logic, utilizing the page objects to interact with the application.\n\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions (e.g., using `WebDriverWait` in Selenium) to wait for elements to become visible or for conditions to be met.  This reduces flakiness caused by timing issues. Example : `WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, \"element_id\")))`\n    *   **Implement Self-Healing (Advanced):** Consider implementing self-healing techniques to automatically recover from common test failures.  For example, if an element is not found, attempt to refresh the page or navigate back and try again. (Can use AI here).\n    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Implement a retry mechanism for flaky tests.  If a test fails, retry it a limited number of times before marking it as a failure.\n    *   **Logging:** Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging test failures. Include timestamps, element locators, and error messages in the logs.\n    *   **Screenshot on Failure:** Capture screenshots of the application state when a test fails to aid in debugging.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets (Initial Exploration):**\n\n    1.  **Homepage:**  Start with the homepage to understand the overall structure and navigation.\n    2.  **Product Listing Pages:** Explore different product categories to identify variations in product display and filtering options.\n    3.  **Product Details Pages:**  Examine the product details page to identify all relevant elements and data points.\n    4.  **Login/Registration Pages:**  Analyze the login and registration forms for input fields and validation rules.\n    5.  **Cart Page:** Identify cart elements, quantity update options and functionalities.\n    6.  **Checkout Page:** Explore the checkout process, including address entry, shipping options, and payment methods.\n    7.  **Contact Us Page:** Inspect form elements and submission process.\n\n*   **Verification Criteria (What Defines \"Success\"?):**\n\n    *   **HTTP Status Codes:**  Verify that all page requests return a 200 OK status code.\n    *   **Element Visibility:**  Ensure that critical elements (e.g., logos, navigation menus, product images, form fields) are visible on the page.\n    *   **Text Verification:** Verify that specific text strings are present on the page (e.g., \"Welcome\", \"Add to Cart\", \"Order Confirmation\").\n    *   **Data Validation:**  Validate that data entered into forms is correctly processed and displayed.\n    *   **Error Message Verification:**  Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or unexpected conditions.\n    *   **Functional Verification:** Ensure that core functionalities (e.g., adding to cart, checkout) are working as expected.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a solid foundation for building a robust automation framework for the Automation Exercise E-Commerce platform.  Regular review and updates are essential to ensure its continued effectiveness."
