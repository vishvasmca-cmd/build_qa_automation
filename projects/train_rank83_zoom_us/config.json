  "master_plan": "# Zoom.us - Master Test Strategy (Smoke Testing)\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis**: Zoom.us is a critical communication platform. Failure can disrupt meetings, webinars, and business operations, leading to productivity loss and potential reputational damage.\n*   **Risk Profile**: High. System unavailability directly impacts user communication and business continuity. Security vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches and privacy violations.\n*   **Testing Scope**:\n    *   **In Scope**:\n        *   Website launch and basic page load.\n        *   Presence and visibility of key elements (Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menu bars).\n    *   **Out of Scope**:\n        *   Functionality of buttons, links, or menu items (no clicks).\n        *   User authentication or account creation.\n        *   Any interaction with the Zoom application itself.\n        *   Performance testing.\n        *   Security testing.\n        *   Error handling.\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility (initially focus on a primary browser like Chrome).\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity)**:\n    *   **Objective**: Verify the Zoom.us website is accessible and core elements are present.\n    *   **Test Cases**:\n        1.  **Website Launch**: Navigate to `https://zoom.us`. Verify the page loads successfully (HTTP 200).\n        2.  **Element Visibility**:\n            *   Verify the presence of a \"Login\" button/link.\n            *   Verify the presence of a \"Signup/Get Started\" button/link.\n            *   Verify the presence of a \"Try for Free\" button/link.\n            *   Verify the presence of 5 additional buttons (any buttons on the homepage).\n            *   Verify the presence of 2 links (any links on the homepage).\n            *   Verify the presence of 2 menu bars (header and/or footer).\n*   **Regression Suite**: N/A (This is a smoke test strategy only)\n*   **Data Strategy**:\n    *   No test data is required for this smoke test. We are only verifying the presence of elements, not interacting with them.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation**:\n    *   For future regression testing, a Page Object Model (POM) structure is highly recommended. This will improve maintainability and reduce code duplication.\n    *   For this smoke test, a simple script is sufficient, but consider structuring it in a way that can be easily extended to a POM later.\n*   **Resilience Strategy**:\n    *   **Polling Assertions**: Use polling assertions (e.g., wait for an element to be visible) to handle potential loading delays.  A timeout of 5-10 seconds should be sufficient.\n    *   **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for website launch in case of temporary network issues.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets**:\n    *   **Homepage (`https://zoom.us`)**: Focus on the header, main content area, and footer.\n*   **Verification Criteria**:\n    *   **Website Launch**: HTTP status code 200.\n    *   **Element Visibility**: Elements are present in the DOM and visible on the page. Use appropriate locators (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath) to identify the elements.\n    *   **No Exceptions**: The test should not throw any exceptions (e.g., `NoSuchElementException`).\n*   **Reporting**:\n    *   Clearly report which elements were found and which were not.\n    *   Include screenshots of the page in case of failures.\n\nThis Master Test Strategy provides a clear roadmap for executing the smoke tests for Zoom.us. It emphasizes speed, reliability, and maintainability, ensuring that the core functionality of the website is always readily available."
