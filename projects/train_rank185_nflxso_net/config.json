  "master_plan": "# Master Test Strategy: Netflix Landing Page (Smoke Test)\n\nThis document outlines the master test strategy for the Netflix landing page (nflxso.net) smoke test. It serves as the blueprint for the engineering team, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to verifying the application's core functionality.\n\n## 1. \ud83d\udd0d RISK ASSESSMENT & PLANNING\n\n*   **Domain Analysis:** The Netflix landing page is a critical component of the user acquisition funnel. Its primary purpose is to attract new users and guide them towards subscription. Failure of this page can directly impact user acquisition and revenue.\n*   **Risk Profile:** Failure of the landing page can lead to:\n    *   **Loss of Potential Subscribers:** Users unable to access the page or key functionalities may abandon the signup process.\n    *   **Brand Damage:** A malfunctioning landing page can negatively impact Netflix's brand image and user trust.\n    *   **Reduced Conversion Rates:** Issues with signup or information access can decrease the number of users who convert to paying subscribers.\n*   **Testing Scope:**\n    *   **In Scope:**\n        *   Website launch and accessibility.\n        *   Presence and basic functionality of key elements: Login, Signup/Get Started, Try for Free (or similar call-to-action), 5 buttons, 2 links, and 2 menu bars.\n        *   Basic rendering of the page layout and visual elements.\n    *   **Out of Scope:**\n        *   Detailed functional testing of login/signup processes.\n        *   Performance testing (load times, responsiveness).\n        *   Cross-browser compatibility testing (beyond a single, representative browser).\n        *   Accessibility testing (beyond basic element presence).\n        *   Error handling and negative scenarios.\n        *   Testing of any functionality beyond the initial landing page.\n\n## 2. \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f TESTING STRATEGY (The \"How\")\n\n*   **Smoke Suite (Sanity):**\n    *   **Objective:** Verify the core functionality of the Netflix landing page is operational.\n    *   **Test Cases:**\n        1.  **Website Launch:** Verify the website (nflxso.net) loads successfully.\n        2.  **Element Presence:** Verify the presence of the following elements:\n            *   Login button/link\n            *   Signup/Get Started button/link\n            *   Try for Free (or similar call-to-action) button/link\n            *   5 additional buttons (any buttons on the page)\n            *   2 links (any links on the page)\n            *   2 menu bars (navigation menus)\n    *   **Data Strategy:**\n        *   **Static Data:** No specific test data is required for this smoke test. The focus is on element presence and basic functionality.\n\n## 3. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE (For the Test Architect)\n\n*   **Framework Recommendation:**\n    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement a POM structure to represent the landing page and its elements. This will improve test maintainability and readability.\n        *   Create a `LandingPage` class with methods to access and interact with the key elements (buttons, links, menus).\n*   **Resilience Strategy:**\n    *   **Polling Assertions:** Use polling assertions to handle potential loading delays or asynchronous element rendering. This will reduce flakiness due to timing issues. For example, poll for the presence of the \"Login\" button for a short period (e.g., 5 seconds) before failing the test.\n    *   **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded and interactable before attempting to interact with them.\n\n## 4. \u2694\ufe0f EXECUTION & MINING INSTRUCTIONS (For the Senior QA)\n\n*   **Mining Targets:**\n    1.  **Homepage (nflxso.net):** Focus on identifying the required elements (buttons, links, menus) on the main landing page.\n*   **Verification Criteria:**\n    *   **Website Launch:** HTTP 200 status code AND the presence of the main page content (e.g., Netflix logo, introductory text).\n    *   **Element Presence:** Each specified element (Login, Signup, Try for Free, 5 buttons, 2 links, 2 menus) must be present and visible on the page.  The test should verify the element exists in the DOM.\n*   **Reporting:** Any failure in the smoke test should be considered a critical issue and immediately reported to the development team."
