  "master_plan": "Okay, here's a Master Test Plan for Moderna's website (modernatx.com), focusing on smoke testing as requested.  This plan aims to guide autonomous agents in mining information, verifying functionality, and structuring a robust smoke test suite.\n\n# **Master Test Plan: ModernaTX.com - Smoke Test**\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the Master Test Plan for smoke testing the ModernaTX.com website.  The primary goal is to ensure the website is operational, core navigation is functional, and a key user flow is working as expected. This will serve as a blueprint for the autonomous agents tasked with executing and maintaining the smoke test suite.\n\n**2. Domain Information & Analysis**\n\n*   **Website URL:** https://www.modernatx.com\n*   **Business Domain:** Healthcare / Biotechnology (Pharmaceuticals)\n*   **Website Purpose:**  Inform visitors about Moderna's mRNA technology, pipeline of medicines, company mission, investor relations, and career opportunities. It serves as a primary communication channel for the company.\n*   **Target Audience:** Patients, Healthcare Professionals, Investors, Potential Employees, Media, and the general public.\n*   **Key Areas of Interest from a Testing Perspective:**\n    *   **Content Accuracy:**  Given the healthcare domain, information accuracy is paramount.\n    *   **Regulatory Compliance:** The website likely needs to adhere to various regulations regarding the communication of medical information.\n    *   **Security:** Protect user data and maintain website integrity.\n    *   **Accessibility:** Ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities.\n    *   **Performance:** Website must load quickly and reliably.\n\n**3. Smoke Test Suite Definition**\n\nThe smoke test suite will consist of the following test cases:\n\n**3.1. Basic Website Availability**\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-001\n*   **Test Case Name:** Website is Up and Running\n*   **Description:** Verify that the website is accessible and returns a 200 OK HTTP status code.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.modernatx.com.\n    2.  Verify that the server returns a 200 OK HTTP status code.\n    3.  Verify that the page loads successfully without any server errors.\n*   **Expected Result:** The website loads successfully with a 200 OK status code.\n\n**3.2. Core Navigation**\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-002\n*   **Test Case Name:** Verify Core Menu Links\n*   **Description:**  Check that the main navigation menu links are present and point to valid URLs.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.modernatx.com.\n    2.  Identify the main navigation menu (usually in the header).\n    3.  For each link in the main menu (e.g., \"About Us,\" \"Science & Technology,\" \"Products,\" \"Investors,\" \"Careers\"):\n        *   Extract the link's `href` attribute.\n        *   Navigate to the extracted URL.\n        *   Verify that the page loads successfully and returns a 200 OK status code.\n*   **Expected Result:** All main menu links are present, clickable, and navigate to valid pages without errors.\n\n**3.3. Core User Flow - \"Learn More\" from Homepage Hero**\n\n*   **Test Case ID:** SMOKE-003\n*   **Test Case Name:** Navigate to \"Learn More\" from Homepage Hero Section\n*   **Description:**  Verify the main user goal: Navigate to Moderna homepage. Verify the hero headline contains 'mRNA medicines to transform lives'. Find and click the 'Learn More' button.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Navigate to https://www.modernatx.com.\n    2.  Locate the hero section on the homepage.\n    3.  Verify that the hero headline contains the text 'mRNA medicines to transform lives'.\n    4.  Locate the \"Learn More\" button within the hero section.\n    5.  Click the \"Learn More\" button.\n    6.  Verify that the navigation leads to a relevant page (e.g., About Us, Science & Technology).  Inspect the URL to ensure it has changed to something other than the homepage.\n*   **Expected Result:** The user is redirected to a relevant page after clicking the \"Learn More\" button. Headline verification should pass.\n\n**4. Strategic Mining Instructions for Autonomous Agents**\n\nThese instructions guide the autonomous agents on which elements and pages to prioritize for analysis and testing.\n\n*   **Homepage Analysis:**\n    *   **Priority:** High\n    *   **Elements:**\n        *   Hero Section: Extract headline text, button text, and linked URL for the \"Learn More\" button.\n        *   Main Navigation Menu: Extract all link text and `href` attributes.\n        *   Footer: Extract all links and their `href` attributes (for future expansion of the test suite).\n        *   Cookie Consent Banner (if present): Determine its behavior and how to interact with it.\n    *   **Purpose:** Essential for verifying the core user flow and navigation.\n\n*   **Main Navigation Pages (linked from the header):**\n    *   **Priority:** Medium\n    *   **Elements:**\n        *   Page Titles: Extract the `<title>` tag content for verification of page context.\n        *   Key Content Sections: Identify and extract headings (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`) to understand the page's main topics.\n    *   **Purpose:** To ensure basic content is loading correctly on key pages.\n\n*   **Investor Relations Section:**\n    *   **Priority:** Low (for initial smoke test, but important for long-term monitoring)\n    *   **Elements:**\n        *   Financial Reports: Identify and extract links to financial reports (PDFs, etc.).\n        *   Stock Price Information: Locate the element displaying stock price and extract its value.\n    *   **Purpose:**  Monitor the availability of critical investor information.\n\n*   **Mobile Responsiveness:**\n     *   **Priority:** Medium\n     *   **Action**: Use different resolutions (e.g., iphone, ipad)\n     *   **Purpose**: Check the website scales properly to the form factor\n\n**5. Test Environment**\n\n*   **Browser:** Chrome (latest stable version)\n*   **Operating System:** Platform independent (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n*   **Network:** Stable internet connection\n\n**6. Test Data**\n\n*   No specific test data is required for the initial smoke tests.\n\n**7.  Test Automation Strategy**\n\n*   The autonomous agents should be configured to:\n    *   Execute the test cases defined in Section 3.\n    *   Use the mining instructions in Section 4 to gather data about the website structure and content.\n    *   Report any failures immediately, including detailed error messages and screenshots.\n    *   Run the smoke test suite on a regular schedule (e.g., hourly or daily).\n\n**8. Success/Failure Criteria**\n\n*   The smoke test suite is considered successful if all test cases in Section 3 pass.\n*   Any failure in the smoke test suite indicates a critical issue that requires immediate investigation.\n\n**9.  Future Considerations**\n\n*   Expand the smoke test suite to cover more critical user flows.\n*   Implement more comprehensive testing, including functional, regression, performance, and security testing.\n*   Integrate with a bug tracking system to automatically report failures.\n\nThis Master Test Plan provides a solid foundation for building and maintaining a robust smoke test suite for ModernaTX.com. The autonomous agents should use this document as a guide for mining information, verifying functionality, and structuring the test suite. Regular review and updates to this plan will be necessary to ensure it remains effective as the website evolves."
