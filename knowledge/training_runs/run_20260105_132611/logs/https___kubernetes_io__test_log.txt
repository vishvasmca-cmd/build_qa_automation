        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I am currently on the homepage. I will start by clicking the 'Documentation' link in the header to explore a key feature.
    
        2. The goal is to generally explore the main features of the site after navigating to the documentation home page. Since I've already clicked the 'Documentation' link, the next logical step is to explore the available documentation by clicking on one of the prominent links. 'View Concepts' seems like a good starting point to understand the fundamental ideas behind Kubernetes.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked 'Documentation'. Now I will click on the 'Understand Kubernetes' button to further explore the main features of the site.
    
        4. I have already navigated to the documentation and concepts page. Now I should explore another main feature. I will click on 'Kubernetes Blog' in the top navigation to explore the blog.
    
        5. I am on the Kubernetes Blog page. I have previously clicked on the Documentation link, then tried to click something (unsuccessfully). Then I clicked on 'Understand Kubernetes' and finally 'Kubernetes Blog'. I will now navigate back to the main kubernetes.io page to continue exploring.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on Documentation, Understand Kubernetes, Kubernetes Blog, and returned to the homepage. Next, I'll click on the 'Learn Kubernetes Basics' button to explore another feature.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on Documentation, Understand Kubernetes, Kubernetes Blog, navigated to the home page, and clicked on Learn Kubernetes Basics. Now I will navigate to the pricing page to explore a main feature.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The last action was navigating to the pricing page, which resulted in a 404 error. Since the pricing page is broken, I will navigate to the homepage and try exploring a different main feature. Clicking on the Kubernetes logo should bring us back to the homepage.
    
        9. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which includes navigating the site and exploring main features. I have already clicked on Documentation, Understand Kubernetes, Kubernetes Blog, Learn Kubernetes Basics, navigated to Pricing and then returned to the Home page. Now I will click on the 'Watch Video' button since that seems like a main feature and it has not been clicked yet. Also, the spatial verification indicated that the 'Watch Video' button might be missing.
    
        10. I have already navigated to the Kubernetes homepage, documentation, tutorials and pricing page. Now I will explore the main features section on the homepage. I will click on the first link in the main features section: 'Automated rollouts and rollbacks'.
    
        11. I have already navigated to the home page and explored some key features like 'Learn Kubernetes Basics', 'Documentation', 'Kubernetes Blog' and 'Automated rollouts and rollbacks'. The goal is to explore main features. I will now click on 'Service discovery and load balancing' to explore another feature.
    
        12. The goal is to explore the main features of the Kubernetes website. I've already clicked several links, including 'Watch Video', 'Automated rollouts and rollbacks' and 'Service discovery and load balancing'. Now I'll click the 'Storage orchestration' link to continue exploring the features on the homepage.
    
        13. The goal is 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. The current page is a documentation page about Kubernetes Persistent Volumes, reached after clicking the 'Storage orchestration' link in the previous step. This successfully explores the 'Storage' feature. Now I will navigate to another section of the documentation by clicking 'Concepts'.
    
        14. I am currently on the 'Kubernetes Concepts' page, and the goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Concepts' in the previous step. Now I can click on other links on this page such as 'Cluster Architecture'.
    
        15. I am currently on the 'Cluster Architecture' page, which is part of the 'Concepts' section of the Kubernetes documentation. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I will click on the 'About this architecture' details element to expand it and explore the content within. This will help in verifying key elements on the page.
    
        16. I am currently on the 'Cluster Architecture' documentation page. The last action was clicking the 'About this architecture' link which expanded the details. Now, I should explore a different main feature. Let's go back to the 'Concepts' page and then click on 'Workloads'.
    
        17. I am on the Kubernetes Concepts page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on the Concepts link, so now I will click on the 'Workloads' link to explore a different section.
    
        18. I am currently on the 'Workloads' page within the Kubernetes documentation. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features and verify key elements. I have already navigated to the workloads page. Now I will click on a link to explore a sub-section of workloads.
    
        19. I am currently on the Pods documentation page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since I have already navigated to the Pods page, I will now click on another link under the concepts menu, specifically 'Pod Lifecycle', to further explore the documentation.
    
        20. I am on the 'Pod Lifecycle' page. The goal is 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. I have already navigated to this page through a series of clicks: Home -> Service Discovery -> Storage Orchestration -> Concepts -> Cluster Architecture -> About this architecture -> Concepts -> Workloads -> Pods -> Pod Lifecycle. Now I will click on another link on the page to explore a different feature.
