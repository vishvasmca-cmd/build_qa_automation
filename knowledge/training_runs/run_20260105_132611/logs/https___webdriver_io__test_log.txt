        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I should start by clicking on one of the main navigation links to explore the site. 'Docs' seems like a good place to start.
    
        2. The goal is to generally explore the site. I've already clicked the 'Docs' link. Now I'll click the 'API' link to explore another main feature.
    
        3. I have already navigated to the API documentation page. Now I will click on 'Contribute' to explore another main feature of the site.
    
        4. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to Docs, API, and Contribute pages. Now I will navigate to the Community page to explore another main feature.
    
        5. I am on the community support page. I have already clicked on Docs, API, Contribute and Community links in the navigation bar. Now I will explore other main features such as blog and sponsor.
    
        6. I am on the blog page, and I have already clicked through the main navigation items based on the history. The next step is to explore the footer links. Starting with the 'Getting Started' link in the footer.
    
        7. I have already clicked on Docs, API, Contribute, Community, Blog and Getting Started. I will now click on 'Why Webdriver.IO?' to explore more features of the site.
    
        8. The goal is to smoke test the site. I have already navigated to several pages ('Docs', 'API', 'Contribute', 'Community', 'Blog', 'Getting Started', and 'Why Webdriver.IO?'). Now I will navigate to the 'API Reference' page.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked Docs, API, Contribute, Community, Blog, Getting Started, Why Webdriver.IO?, and API Reference. Now, I will click 'Sponsor' to continue exploring the site's main features.
    
        10. I have already navigated to several pages including Docs, API, Contribute, Community, Blog, Getting Started, Why WebdriverIO?, API Reference, and Sponsor. Now I will explore the main features by navigating to the GitHub repository.
    
        11. I have navigated to the sponsor page. The next step in the goal is to explore main features. Now I will click on Swag Store to explore another feature.
    
        12. I have already navigated to the Sponsor page. Now I will click on the 'Docs' link in the top navigation to explore more features of the site.
    
        13. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already navigated to a number of pages like Contribute, Community, Blog, Getting Started, Why Webdriver.IO?, API Reference, Sponsor, GitHub repository, Swag Store, and Docs. Now I will click on the 'API' link to explore another main feature.
    
        14. I have already clicked on many links, like Community, Blog, Getting Started, Why Webdriver.IO?, API Reference, Sponsor, GitHub repository, Swag Store, Docs, and API. Now, I will click on the 'Contribute' link to explore another main feature of the site as part of the autonomous smoke test.
    
        15. I have explored the Blog, Getting Started, Why WebdriverIO, API Reference, Sponsor, Github Repo, Swag Store, Docs, API, and Contribute pages. Now I will click on Community to explore that page. It is part of exploring the main features of the site as per the goal.
    
        16. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I have already navigated to several pages, including Docs, API, Contribute and Community. The current page is the "Need Help?" page. I will now click on the "Blog" link to continue exploring the site's main features.
    
        17. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on several links in the header and footer including Docs, API, Contribute, Community, and Blog. I am now on the blog page, so I will click the first blog post to explore it.
    
        18. I have already navigated to the blog page and clicked on the first blog post. Now, I need to explore other main features. I will navigate back to the homepage to explore other options. I will start by clicking on the WebdriverIO link in the header, which should take me back to the homepage.
    
        19. I have already clicked on multiple links in the header and in the blog. Now I will click on the 'Get Started' button to explore another main feature of the site.
    
        20. I have already navigated to the site and explored several links in the navigation bar, including Docs, API, Contribute, Community, Blog, and the main WebdriverIO link. Now I'll explore the "Guides" link within the sidebar to continue exploring main features.
