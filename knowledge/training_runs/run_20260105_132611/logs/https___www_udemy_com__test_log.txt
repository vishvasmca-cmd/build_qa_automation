🚀 Explorer: Starting Strategy 2026. Goal: Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements

🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.udemy.com/
📍 On Page: Udemy Security Check
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 1 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The page is displaying a security check by Cloudflare. I have no automated way to pass this. I will attempt to navigate to the homepage directly by using the Cloudflare link. This will allow me to explore publicly accessible areas of the site.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("link", { name: "Cloudflare" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=1 (Cloudflare)

🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.udemy.com/
📍 On Page: Udemy Security Check
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 1 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I am on a security check page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since I don't have any credentials and I'm stuck on a security check page, I should try navigating to a different part of the site that might not require a login, such as the 'Cloudflare' link in the footer, which I previously clicked. Since that did not move me past this page, I will mark the goal as unachievable for now, since I cannot proceed without passing the security check. I will click the Cloudflare link again just in case it leads me to a page that allows me to bypass the security check.

🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 1 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The page is stuck on a Cloudflare security check. I will try clicking the Cloudflare link again to see if it resolves the issue, even though it didn't work in the previous two steps.

--- Step 4 ---
🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.udemy.com/
📍 On Page: Udemy Security Check
🤔 State: error
📡 Sending 1 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I am currently on a security check page, which indicates a problem. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have clicked the 'Cloudflare' link multiple times without success. Since the page indicates an error state and I cannot proceed further without solving the security check, I should stop and indicate that the goal cannot be achieved at this time.
✅ Goal Achieved!
