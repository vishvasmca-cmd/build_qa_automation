        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I am currently on the homepage/login screen. I will start by exploring the 'Platform' menu to learn more about GitHub's features.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I previously clicked the "Platform" button. Now I should click the "Solutions" button to continue exploring the site's main features.
    
        3. I am on the GitHub landing page and the goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I have already clicked on 'Platform' and 'Solutions'. Next, I will click on 'Resources' to explore another main feature.
    
        4. I have already clicked on 'Platform', 'Solutions', and 'Resources' in the navigation bar. Now, I will click on 'Open Source' to explore another main feature of the site, as outlined in the goal.
    
        5. I've already clicked through Platform, Solutions, Resources, and Open Source. Now I'll click 'Pricing' to explore another main feature as part of the smoke test.
    
        6. I am on the GitHub landing page. The goal is to smoke test the site by exploring main features and verifying key elements. I have already clicked on several of the top navigation links. Now, since the elements list is empty, I will scroll down the page to see if more content loads or becomes visible.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked through the main navigation items: Platform, Solutions, Resources, Open Source, and Pricing. I've also scrolled on the Pricing page. Since there are no credentials, I will avoid login. I will click the 'Homepage' link next to continue exploring the site.
    
        8. I have already clicked on Platform, Solutions, Resources, Open Source, and Pricing, scrolled, and then returned to the Homepage. The next step in the goal is to explore main features. I will explore the 'Try GitHub Copilot free' link since it is a prominent feature advertised on the page.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features. I have already navigated to the GitHub Copilot Pro page. Now I am presented with a login screen. Since no credentials are provided, I will skip login and explore the publicly accessible areas by navigating to the footer and clicking 'Docs'.
    
        10. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. I have already navigated to the Docs page. Now I should explore the main features and verify key elements. A good starting point would be to use the search bar to look for something.
    
        11. I am on the GitHub Docs page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on the search button. Now I will explore the main features by clicking on the 'Get started' link.
    
        12. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which includes exploring the main features and verifying key elements. I have already clicked on the 'Get started' button. Now I will explore 'GitHub Actions'.
    
        13. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on several links. Now I will click on another link on the page, such as GitHub Packages, to continue exploring the site's features.
    
        14. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already navigated to GitHub Actions documentation and Packages. Now I will click on the 'Overview' link to explore another main feature of GitHub Actions. It's a good way to continue exploring main features.
    
        15. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I am currently on the GitHub Actions Documentation page, and the previous actions were related to navigation within the documentation. Now I will click on 'Quickstart' to explore another main feature of GitHub Actions.
    
        16. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, navigating the site and exploring its main features. The current page is a documentation page about GitHub Actions. I have already navigated to the documentation, specifically the 'Understand GitHub Actions' section after clicking on 'Quickstart'. Now, I will navigate to another section within the documentation, for instance the pricing page.
    
        17. I am on the pricing page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I'm already on the pricing page, I will explore it by clicking on the 'Platform' button.
    
        18. The current page is the GitHub Pricing page, and the goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I've previously clicked the 'Platform' button. Next, I will click the 'Solutions' button to explore another main feature.
    
        19. I am on the pricing page. I have clicked 'Platform' and 'Solutions' buttons, so I should now click the 'Resources' button to further explore the main navigation features. This aligns with the goal of exploring the main features.
    
        20. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I'm currently on the pricing page. I've already clicked 'Platform', 'Solutions', and 'Resources'. Next, I will click on 'Open Source'.
