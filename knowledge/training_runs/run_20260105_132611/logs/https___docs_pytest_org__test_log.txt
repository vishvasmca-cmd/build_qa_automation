        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've clicked through several pages in the 'how-to' section already. I will now scroll down to explore the current page more thoroughly before navigating again.
    
        11. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to the "How to use fixtures" page. There are still other links in the navigation to explore. I will select 'How to mark test functions with attributes' to continue exploring.
    
        12. I'm currently on the 'How to mark test functions with attributes' page, which is part of exploring the main features of the site. Since I've already navigated through several 'How-to guides,' I'll now navigate back to the main page and explore other sections to fulfill the goal of 'exploring main features'. Clicking the header element with text 'stable' is likely to lead to the main page.
    
        13. I've landed on the 'How to mark test functions with attributes' page. Now I will navigate to another page. I will click 'How to parametrize fixtures and test functions' to explore another part of the documentation.
    
        14. I am currently on the 'How to parametrize fixtures and test functions' documentation page, and I have already clicked on the element with text 'How to parametrize fixtures and test functions'. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I have been clicking through the 'How-to guides', and I have run out of those, I can now scroll down to see if there are other main features or key elements to explore.
    
        15. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and exploring its main features. I have already navigated to multiple 'How-to' guides. I will continue exploring by clicking another link in the navigation menu.
    
        16. I'm on the 'How to use subtests' page. I've been clicking through documentation pages. Now I will scroll to look for new content.

        19. I am on the 'How to use temporary directories and files in tests' page. The goal is 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. I have been clicking through the 'How-to guides' section. Now I should scroll again to continue exploration.
    
        20. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I'm on a documentation page now. I will click on another link in the 'How-to guides' section to further explore the documentation.
