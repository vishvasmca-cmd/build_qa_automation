        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to perform a smoke test, which includes exploring main features and verifying key elements. I'm currently on the landing page, which appears to be a login screen. Since I don't have login credentials, I'll skip the login and explore publicly available areas, like the courses listed on the page, starting with 'Basic AI Course'.
    
        2. The previous action was clicking the 'Basic AI Course' link. I am now on a login page. The goal is a smoke test: navigate the site and explore main features. Since `test_data` is empty, I will skip login and click the 'CareerRaah Home' link to navigate back to the home page and explore other features.
    
        3. I have already navigated to the Basic AI Course page and then clicked on the CareerRaah Home link. Now I should explore some features of the home page. I'll start by clicking on the 'Blog' link in the footer.
    
        4. The current goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I've already clicked on 'Basic AI Course', then 'CareerRaah Home' and finally the 'Blog' link. Now I will explore the 'Contact Us' link in the footer to ensure it is reachable. Because there are no credentials, I will skip the login button.
    
        5. The current page is a contact form. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. There are no credentials available, so I will not attempt to log in. I will click the CareerRaah Home link to navigate back to the homepage and continue exploring the site.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Basic AI Course', 'CareerRaah Home', 'Blog', 'Contact Us', and then 'CareerRaah Home' again. Now I will click on another available link.
    
        7. I am on the landing page, and I have already clicked on the basic AI course, the home button, the blog and contact us links in the header. Now I will explore the other main features by clicking on the Advanced AI Course link.
    
        8. The current page is the CareerRaah Blog, which has a login screen. The goal is to navigate the site and explore features. Since I don't have login credentials, I will attempt to navigate to the 'CareerRaah Home' page to explore publicly accessible content. The previous step was clicking 'Advanced AI Course', so I need to go back to the home page. Element ID 1 has the text 'CareerRaah Home'.
    
        9. I am on the CareerRaah Upskill Platform. The goal is to do an autonomous smoke test, which includes navigating the site and exploring main features. I have already clicked on several links. Now, I will click on the 'Contact Us' link to further navigate the site.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows a series of clicks that have explored some links. I will now navigate to the home page to get a fresh start and explore from there.
    
        11. I have navigated to different pages by clicking on links in the main navigation. Now I will explore the main features by clicking on the Advanced AI Course Link.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to different pages. Now I will click on a 'Start Lesson' button to explore the lesson content. There are multiple 'Start Lesson' buttons; I will select the first one, which has id 22.
    
        13. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have previously clicked on the Advanced AI Course and started a lesson. Now I'll go back to the home page by clicking the CareerRaah Home link to explore other main features, as the previous actions seem to be looping back to the same pages.
    
        14. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I am currently on the login screen. Since no credentials are provided in `test_data`, I will explore the site by clicking on a link in the header, specifically, 'CareerRaah Home'.
    
        15. I am on the login screen. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since I do not have credentials in `test_data`, I will not attempt to log in. Instead, I will explore the publicly accessible areas. The 'CareerRaah Home' link in the top left will take me to the homepage to explore its features.
    
        16. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the website. I have already clicked on several elements. Currently, I'm on the homepage, indicated by the page context. Since there are no credentials available in `test_data`, I should avoid the login button. Instead, I will explore the 'QA Playground' link as it is a prominent feature for QA professionals, and clicking on it will help explore the website's features.
    
        17. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I've already clicked on 'QA Playground'. Since I'm on the landing page which promotes AI upskilling courses and has a QA playground and there are no login credentials, I will now click on the QA Playground to explore that area of the site.
    
        18. I am on the QA Automation Playground page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore its main features. I've already clicked 'CareerRaah Home' and 'Contact Us', and also tried to explore some courses. Now I should click on one of the 'Launch App' buttons to explore one of the available applications.
    
        19. I have landed on the SkillBuilder Checklist page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore its main features. I have already navigated to the QA Playground and launched the SkillBuilder Checklist. Now I will try exploring by clicking the 'Show Automation Guide' button.
    
        20. I'm currently on the SkillBuilder Checklist page, which is a login screen. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I don't have login credentials in `test_data`, so I will explore publicly accessible areas of the page. Since I haven't clicked any links in the footer yet, I will start with the 'Home' link.
