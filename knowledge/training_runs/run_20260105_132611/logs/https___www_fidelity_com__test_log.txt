💭 Thought: The goal is to do an autonomous smoke test, but the current page is a blank screen, implying a fresh start or an error. Without a starting URL or a 'navigate' action in history, I need to start by navigating to a reasonable default homepage. Since I don't have a specific URL, and no login credentials, I will navigate to 'https://www.google.com' as a generic starting point for exploring publicly accessible features.
