        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and exploring its main features. Since this is the first step and I'm on the homepage, I should accept all cookies to proceed. I will click on the 'Accept All' button to dismiss the banner and continue exploring the website.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I am currently on the homepage. I will start by clicking on the 'Invest' tab to explore the investment options.
    
        3. I have already clicked on 'Accept All' and 'Invest'. Now I want to explore other main features. The navigation bar contains 'Cash', 'Retirement', 'Offers', and 'Resources'. I will explore the 'Cash' feature next.
    
        4. I have already navigated to the Invest and Cash pages. Now I'll navigate to the Retirement page to explore more main features.
    
        5. I have already clicked on Invest, Cash, and Retirement. Now I will explore the 'Resources' navigation item to explore the site's main features.
    
        6. I've clicked through the main navigation items. Now I will click the 'Get started' button to see the signup flow.
    
        7. The current page is the 'How do you want to get started?' screen. I have already clicked through a series of options. Since this is a smoke test, and I don't have credentials, I will skip account creation and instead navigate back to the homepage to explore other areas. I'll click the Betterment logo to return to the homepage.
    
        8. The previous action failed because the target element was not found. The current page is a 'login_screen' asking how I want to get started. The goal is to 'Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. I will select the 'High-yield cash' option to explore one of the main features. This allows me to move forward without logging in.
    
        9. I am currently on the signup page, which requires an email address. The instructions state 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. I do not have credentials to log in. Since the instructions do not require me to sign up, I will navigate back to the homepage and explore links in the footer or other public areas.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features of the website, and verify key elements. I've already clicked on the Invest, Cash, Retirement, Resources and Get Started buttons. I've also navigated back to the home page. Next, I will explore the 'Offers' tab.
    
        11. The goal is to navigate the site and explore its main features. I have already clicked several links. Now I will explore the invest page to explore main features.
    
        12. I have already clicked on 'Invest', 'Cash', 'Retirement', 'Resources', 'Get started', and 'Offers'. Now I'm back on the homepage after navigating and clicking invest again. I will now click 'Learn more' to explore another feature.
    
        13. I have already navigated to the 'Self-Directed Investing' page. Now I will explore the main features by clicking on the 'FAQ' link in the footer.
    
        14. I am on the FAQ page. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already clicked through a few navigation elements. Now I will click the "How is Betterment different?" button and other buttons to test expanding them.
    
        15. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features. The last action was clicking on 'How is Betterment different?'. Now I will click the next FAQ button on the help center page to continue exploring the page.
    
        16. I am on the Betterment Help Center page, specifically viewing common questions. I have already clicked on the 'How is Betterment different?' and 'How does Betterment compare to other financial companies?' buttons. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I will continue exploring the help center by clicking on another question to expand it.
    
        17. I have already explored the help center page and clicked on the first three questions. Now I will click on the next question: Is Betterment a regulated financial institution?
    
        18. I am currently on the Betterment Help Center page, having clicked on several FAQ buttons. The goal is to explore the main features of the site. I will now click another FAQ button to further explore this page. I will click the button associated with 'What is your Mission Statement?' to expand it.
    
        19. I have already navigated to the site and explored the Offers and Invest sections. I also clicked on Learn More, FAQ, and a number of common questions from the FAQ page. The next step is to continue exploring the main navigation. I will click on 'Cash' to see what that section contains.
    
        20. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked on several FAQ buttons and the 'Cash' button. Next, I will click on the 'Checking' option to explore another feature.
