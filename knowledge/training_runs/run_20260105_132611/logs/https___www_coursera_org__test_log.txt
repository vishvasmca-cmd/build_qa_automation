        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since the page is the homepage, and there are no credentials for login, I will start by exploring the catalog.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'Explore our catalog'. Now I will click on 'Degrees' to explore another main feature.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already navigated to the degrees page. Now I will click on the 'Explore our catalog' button to continue exploring the site.
    
        4. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site by navigating it and exploring the main features. I've already clicked on 'Explore our catalog' and then 'Degrees'. Now I will click the element with text 'Bachelor's Degrees' to explore this category.
    
        5. The current page is 'Coursera Degrees'. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked 'Explore our catalog', 'Degrees', then 'Explore our catalog' AGAIN, then 'Bachelor's Degrees'. Now I will click on one of the categories to continue exploring.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site, explore the main features, and verify the key elements. The history shows that I have already navigated to the degrees page and clicked on a Bachelor's degree link. Now I will explore the Computer Science Degrees to continue exploring the main features.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate and explore the site. I'm currently on the Computer Science Degrees page. I will click on the 'Explore our catalog' button to further explore the site.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Currently on the Computer Science Degrees page. Previous actions included navigating to degrees and then to Computer Science degrees, and again clicking on 'Explore our catalog'. Since clicking the Explore our catalog button has already been performed in the previous steps, I will proceed to click on another element, for example, 'Explore roles' button to further explore the page. Alternatively I could scroll, but clicking is higher confidence at discovering new content.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I'm currently on the Coursera Career Academy page, which seems to be a landing page with options to explore different career paths. I will explore a career path and click on the 'Software Engineering & IT' to filter the available roles.
    
        10. I have already navigated to the Software Engineering & IT category page in the Career Academy. The next step is to verify key elements. I'll click the 'Explore our catalog' button, which should take me to the catalog page.
    
        11. I have navigated the site and explored the 'Software Engineering & IT' category. Now I should check the key elements of the page. I'll start by clicking on the 'Cyber Security Analyst' role.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features of the site. I have already navigated to multiple categories. Now I will explore professional certificates
    
        13. I am on the search results page for Professional Certificates. I have explored degrees and career academies. Now I will explore the filters and sort options, to verify key elements
    
        14. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. The previous steps have navigated to the Professional Certificates search results and opened the 'Filter & Sort' menu. Now, I can interact with the filters to explore the filtering functionality. I'll start by clicking the 'Topic' filter button.
    
        15. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements of the Coursera site. I've already navigated to the Professional Certificates search results and opened the 'Topic' filter. Now I need to select a topic to continue exploring.
    
        16. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. The history shows a series of clicks to reach the 'Professional Certificates' search results page, then filtering by 'Topic', and finally scrolling. Now I will click on the 'Duration' filter button to continue exploring the filtering options.
    
        17. The goal is to explore the main features of the site. I've already clicked on the 'Duration' filter. Now, I'll click on the 'Level' filter button to further explore the filtering options available on the search results page.
    
        18. I am on the search results page for Professional Certificates. I have previously clicked on 'Topic', 'Duration', and 'Level' filter options. Now, I will click on one of the search result to explore the main features and verify key elements.
    
        19. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. The current page shows search results for 'Professional Certificates'. The history indicates that I have explored some filters and clicked on a specific result ('Google Data Analytics'). I will now navigate back to the homepage and search for another course to continue exploring the site's features.
    
        20. The user goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I'm currently on the Coursera homepage. There's no specific order to the exploration mentioned in the goal, so I will click the 'Explore our catalog' button to start exploring the courses.
