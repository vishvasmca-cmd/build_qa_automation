        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements of the Robinhood website. Since I'm on the landing page, I will start by exploring the 'Learn' section to gather more information about Robinhood's offerings. The learn section will offer more insight into the main features of the site. I will choose the first 'Learn' button with id 70.
    
        2. I am on the homepage, and I previously clicked on 'Learn'. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Let's click on 'About us' to explore company information.
    
        3. I have already clicked 'Learn' and then 'About us'. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I will now click the 'Careers' link in the footer to explore another area of the site.
    
        4. The goal is to perform a smoke test: navigate the site and explore the main features. The history shows a few clicks already done. The current page appears to be the Robinhood homepage. The goal does not specify any particular order of navigation, so let's continue exploring by clicking another main feature, for example, 'Invest'.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features of the site. I have clicked on Learn, About Us, Careers and Invest in the previous steps. Now I will explore the 'Crypto' feature from the navigation bar.
    
        6. I have clicked on Learn, About us, Careers, Invest, and Crypto, according to the history. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. Now, let's explore 'Options' to continue exploring the site's features.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on Learn, About Us, Careers, Invest, Crypto and Options. Let me click on Banking next to explore that main feature.
    
        8. I have navigated to a few of the main navigation links. I will click on the last one, Credit Card, to continue exploring the main features.
    
        9. I am on the Robinhood homepage, which is a login screen. The goal is 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. I've already clicked through Learn, About Us, Careers, Invest, Crypto, Options, Banking, and Credit Card. I will click on the 'Support' link.
    
        10. I'm on the Robinhood homepage, currently on the login screen. The goal is to smoke test the site, exploring main features. I've already clicked Learn, About Us, Careers, Invest, Crypto, Options, Banking, Credit Card, and Support. I will click on 'About us' again, in case I missed something.
    
        11. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've clicked several links in the header and footer already. Since I'm back on the login screen and there are no credentials, I'll click another footer link. I will click on Terms & Conditions.
    
        12. I have already clicked several links in the footer. The goal is a smoke test to explore main features and verify key elements. I will now click the 'Learn' link in the footer.
    
        13. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked several links in the footer and main navigation. I will click on another available link to continue exploring the website, this time I will click on Fee Schedule.
    
        14. I have already explored main navigation, footer links and internal links. I will complete the autonomous smoke test by clicking on 'Learn more' button in the main page, to get more information about the platform.
    
        15. I have clicked several footer links already. Now I will click the 'Invest' link in the footer as part of the autonomous smoke test to explore main features.
    
        16. I have explored a few footer and navigation options already. Now I will click on Crypto to continue exploring the main features of the site. The site is currently on the login screen.
    
        17. I am on the login screen of Robinhood. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I am on the login screen and I don't have any credentials, I will explore the main features by clicking on available options in the nav bar.
    
        18. The goal is to explore the main features. I've already clicked on several links in the footer and header. Now, I'll click on the 'Options' link, another main feature, to explore the site further.
    
        19. I have previously clicked on Invest, Crypto, Invest and Options. Now I will try clicking on 'Futures' to explore the main features as requested in the goal, since I am not attempting a login.
    
        20. The current page is the Futures trading platform page which is also the login screen. I have already clicked on other features such as Options, Crypto, and Invest. Now I will click the 'Sign up' button to explore the sign-up flow. Since I do not have any credentials, I will not attempt to log in.
