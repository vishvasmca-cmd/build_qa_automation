        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The current page is the React landing page. I will click on the 'Learn React' link to navigate to the learning section.
    
        2. The goal is to explore the main features. I am currently on the 'React Learn' page after clicking 'Learn React'. Now, I should explore other links on the page to navigate the site. I will click the 'Reference' link to explore the API reference.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site, explore the main features, and verify key elements. I have already navigated to the 'Learn' and 'Reference' sections. Now I'll click on the 'Community' link to explore another main feature of the site.
    
        4. I have already navigated to the Learn, Reference, and Community pages. Now, I will navigate to the Blog page, which is part of the main navigation and essential for exploring the site's features.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on Learn, Reference, Community and Blog. Now I will click on the search bar.
    
        6. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I've already clicked through Learn, Reference, Community, and Blog links. I have also opened the search modal. Now I will click on the 'Use Dark Mode' button to verify that the theme toggles.
    
        7. I have already clicked through the main navigation items: Learn, Reference, Community, and Blog. I have also clicked the search and dark mode buttons. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I will now click the 'Read More' button on one of the blog posts to navigate to a blog post page.
    
        8. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and exploring its main features. I've already clicked through Learn, Reference, Community, Blog, Search and Dark Mode, then Read more on the blog. Now I will go to the next blog post.
    
        9. I have already clicked through the main navigation items, clicked a blog post to read more, and clicked to read another specific blog post. Now, I will toggle dark mode off to test that feature.
    
        10. I have already navigated to the Blog page, and clicked on 'Use Dark Mode'. Now, the current page informs users about a critical security vulnerability in React Server Components. I will now explore the 'React' link on the page. Exploring main features involves clicking through the main navigation.
    
        11. The goal is to do a smoke test of the React site. I have already clicked on Learn React, Reference, Community, Blog, Search, toggled Dark Mode twice, navigated to two blog posts, and returned to the homepage. Now I will click on 'Learn' again and explore it.
    
        12. I have navigated to the main sections of the site (Reference, Community, Blog, Learn). I will now click on 'Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe' to explore one of the main features.
    
        13. I have already navigated to the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial page. I will click one of the buttons on the right side to explore the features.
    
        14. I am currently on the 'Thinking in React' tutorial page. I have already navigated to the site, explored the blog, and started the 'Thinking in React' tutorial. I will now explore the 'Describing the UI' section within the tutorial.
    
        15. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, including navigating the site and exploring the main features. I have already navigated to the 'Describing the UI' page. Now I should explore other main sections under the 'Learn' section by clicking 'Your First Component'.
    
        16. I am currently on the 'Your First Component' page. The autonomous smoke test aims to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I will now click on the 'Importing and Exporting Components' link to explore another feature within the 'Learn' section.
    
        17. I have already navigated to 'Importing and Exporting Components' page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features, so I will navigate back to the 'Learn' section to continue exploring.
    
        18. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which involves navigating the site and exploring its main features. The history indicates that I have already navigated through several 'Learn' pages. Now I will click on Reference to explore a different section.
    
        19. I have already navigated to the Reference page. Now I will click on the 'Hooks' link to explore that section.
    
        20. The goal is to do autonomous smoke test and explore the features of the site. I am currently on the React Hooks reference page. I have already navigated to the Hooks page under Reference. Now I will click on one of the available Hooks to explore the page further. I'll choose useCallback.
