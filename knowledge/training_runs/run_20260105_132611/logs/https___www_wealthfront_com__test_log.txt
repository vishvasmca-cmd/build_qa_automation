        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I am on the login screen, and no credentials were provided, I will explore the site as a guest. I will start by clicking on the Wealthfront logo to navigate to the home page. This is a good starting point for exploring the main features.
    
        2. The goal is to perform a smoke test, which involves exploring main features and verifying key elements. I've already clicked the logo. I will now click the 'Invest' button to navigate to the investing page.
    
        3. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, exploring the main features. The history shows that I have already clicked on the Wealthfront Logo and the Invest button. Now I will click on the 'Cash' button to explore that functionality.
    
        4. I am on the Wealthfront Cash Account page. The goal is to navigate the site, explore the main features, and verify key elements. I have already clicked on Wealthfront Logo, Invest, and Cash. Now I'll click on 'Learn' to further explore the site.
    
        5. The goal is to smoke test the website. I have already navigated to the home page, clicked on Invest, Cash, and Learn. Now, I will navigate to the 'Pricing' page to explore another main feature.
    
        6. I am currently on the Wealthfront Pricing page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I will click the 'Start investing' button to explore the investment options.
    
        7. I am currently on a page that seems to be part of the account setup process. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features, but I've reached a point where it requires account creation or login, and I don't have credentials. Therefore, I should explore publicly accessible areas. I'll click on 'Blog' to navigate to a public page.
    
        8. I have navigated to the blog page. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I will now scroll down to explore the page content.
    
        9. I am currently on the Wealthfront Blog page. I have already navigated to this page and scrolled down. I will click on one of the blog posts to explore further. I will click on the first blog post with the title 'The Headlines This Year Were All About Fear, Anxiety, and Disaster. The Markets Kept Setting Records'
    
        10. I have navigated to a blog post and now I will scroll to explore the page further as part of the smoke test.
