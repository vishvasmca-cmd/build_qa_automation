        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site, explore the main features, and verify key elements. I am on the homepage which has a login screen. No login credentials are provided, so I should try to navigate to publicly accessible areas. The cookie consent banner is active. I will close the cookie banner first, so I can proceed with testing the core functionality.
    
        2. I am on the Atlassian homepage, which is effectively a login screen given the goal of exploring main features. Since I lack login credentials, I will explore the 'Products' menu to navigate the site and explore main features.
    
        3. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which includes navigating the site and exploring its main features. The last action was clicking the 'Products' menu item. Now, I should pick one of the main products to explore. I will choose Jira.
    
        4. The goal is to perform a smoke test of the Atlassian site, and I've already clicked 'Products' and 'Jira'. Now I need to continue exploring the main features, potentially looking for specific elements to verify. Since I've already clicked on Jira via the Products menu, I will now navigate to the Jira product page. I will now click element 36.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows that I have already clicked 'Products' then 'Jira' twice. Since I'm on the landing page, I will now explore another main navigation link, 'Solutions'.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked 'Products' and 'Solutions'. Now I should click on one of the solutions listed on the homepage, like 'Team collaboration'.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate and explore the site. I've clicked on Products, Jira, and Solutions. Let's try clicking on 'Why Atlassian?' to explore another area of the site.
    
        8. I have clicked through products, solutions and why Atlassian. Now I should explore resources.
    
        9. I've already clicked through several top-level navigation items and a sub-menu of each. Now I will try clicking the 'search' button to explore that functionality. This furthers the goal of exploring main features.
    
        10. I have completed clicking on the 'search' button. Now I will type in 'Jira' into the search box to explore the search functionality. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the features.
    
        11. I have previously explored the products, solutions, why Atlassian and Resources section. Now I will click on the search bar and search for a query.
    
        12. I have already clicked around the main navigation and tried filling the search bar. The goal is a smoke test which includes exploring main features. I'll click on one of the category buttons in the middle of the page. I'll click 'Software'.
    
        13. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The previous action was to click on 'Software'. Now I will explore 'Product management'.
    
        14. The current goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on 'Solutions', 'Team collaboration', 'Why Atlassian', 'Resources', 'search', 'Software' and 'Product management' buttons. Now I should explore some more main features. I will now click on the 'Marketing' button.
    
        15. I have already clicked on the 'Solutions', 'Team collaboration', 'Why Atlassian?', 'Resources', and 'search' buttons, and I filled in the search input twice with identical text. I also clicked 'Software', 'Product management', and 'Marketing' buttons. Now, I will click the 'Project management' button.
    
        16. I have explored a number of main features in the categories of Team Collaboration, Why Atlassian, Resources, and different types of product management. Now I will move to the Design category to continue exploring the site's main features.
    
        17. I have already clicked on 'Why Atlassian', 'Resources', the search icon, and several buttons including 'Software', 'Product management', 'Marketing', 'Project management', and 'Design'. There are more buttons to click.
