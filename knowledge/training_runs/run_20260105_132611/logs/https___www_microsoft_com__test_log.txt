        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I'm on the Microsoft homepage, I will start by clicking the "All Microsoft" button to explore more options.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked the 'All Microsoft' button. Now I will click on 'Windows' to explore that area.
    
        3. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features. I have already navigated to the Windows section. I need to identify and click on a key feature or link to explore further. Since the element list is empty, I need to trigger the retrieval of interactive elements first, by scrolling down the page.
    
        4. The goal is to navigate and explore the site. I've already navigated to the Windows page and scrolled down. Now I will click on 'Meet Windows 11' button to explore the features.
    
        5. The goal is to do a smoke test of the site, and I have already navigated to the Windows 11 page. Now I should explore some main features. Since the element list is empty, I need to explore the page to find any clickable elements that represent features or navigation. Because I scrolled the page, I will now scroll again to see if any elements are lazy-loaded and revealed.
    
        6. I have already navigated to the Windows 11 page and scrolled down once. Now, I will scroll down again to explore the page further as part of the autonomous smoke test.
    
        7. I have already navigated to the Windows 11 page and scrolled a couple of times. The next step is to explore some of the main features. I will start by clicking on the 'About Windows' button.
    
        8. I have already clicked on 'All Microsoft', 'Windows', scrolled twice, clicked on 'Meet Windows 11', scrolled again and clicked on 'About Windows'. Now I will click on 'Get Windows' button in the header to explore more features.
    
        9. I have already clicked 'About Windows' and 'Get Windows'. The next button to click is 'Shop PCs'.
    
        10. The page context indicates that I am on the Windows 11 promotional page. I have already clicked 'All Microsoft', 'Windows', scrolled a couple times, and clicked 'About Windows', 'Get Windows', and 'Shop PCs'. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I will now click the 'Help me choose a PC' link.
    
        11. The current page is a quiz to help users choose a PC. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since the page is in a state of the quiz and there are 4 checkbox buttons on the page, let's click on those buttons to make progress on the quiz.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. The current page is 'Help Me Choose'. The history shows that I have already navigated to the 'Help Me Choose' page. Now I will click on the button to go to the next page.
    
        13. I have already navigated to the 'Help Me Choose' page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Clicking the 'Next page' button will advance the 'Help Me Choose' flow, thus exploring a main feature of the site.
    
        14. I have already clicked the 'Next page' button twice. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements of the site. I will click the 'Next page' button again to continue navigating the quiz.
    
        15. I've already clicked the 'Next page' button a few times. I will click it again to keep exploring the site as per the instructions.
    
        16. The goal is to navigate and explore the site. I am currently on the 'Help Me Choose' page. I have clicked the next page button four times already. I will click the next page button again to continue exploring the 'Help Me Choose' flow.
    
        17. I am on the 'Help Me Choose' page and have clicked the 'Next page' button multiple times. I should continue clicking 'Next page' to progress through the quiz. After completing the quiz, I should explore main features and verify key elements, but for now I need to continue progressing through the 'Help me choose' quiz.
    
        18. I am on the 'Help Me Choose' page, which is a quiz. I have been clicking 'Next page' repeatedly. I should continue to the next page until the quiz is done and I can explore other features.
    
        19. The user is on the 'Help Me Choose' page, and the goal is to autonomously smoke test the site by navigating and exploring main features. The previous actions involved navigating through the quiz by clicking the 'Next page' button. I should keep clicking the 'Next page' button to continue with smoke test until quiz is completed.
    
        20. I am on the 'Help Me Choose a Windows PC' page and have clicked the 'Next page' button multiple times. I should continue clicking 'Next page' until the end of the questions.
