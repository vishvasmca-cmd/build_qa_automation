        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features and verify key elements. The page context indicates I am on the login screen. There is no login information provided, so I should skip the login process and explore public pages. The 'Categories' link seems like a reasonable starting point for exploring the site's main features.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Categories'. Now I will click on 'Deals'.
    
        3. I have already clicked on 'Categories' and then 'Deals'. The goal is to 'Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. I will now click on 'Account, sign in' to explore the account features.
    
        4. I am on the login screen. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since there are no login credentials, I will skip the login process and instead explore public features, like 'Categories' to explore the website.
    
        5. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements of the Target website. I have already clicked on Categories, Deals, Account, and Categories again. Since I am at a login screen and no credentials are provided, I will skip the login process and instead click on Categories again to explore publicly accessible areas of the website.
    
        6. I have already clicked on the Categories button multiple times and the Deals button once. I should now click on the 'Account, sign in' link again, as I am on the login screen. The overall goal is to explore main features and verify key elements, and accessing the account is part of this. However, since no test data is available, I will skip the login process.
    
        7. The page is showing a sign-in overlay. I do not have the credentials to sign in. The goal is to explore the main features of the website. I will attempt to proceed by clicking on a publicly available link such as 'Categories'.
    
        8. I have clicked on 'Categories' and 'Deals' and 'Account, sign in' multiple times. I should explore the 'search' functionality to fulfill the goal of exploring the main features. The input field for search is identified as element 32.
    
        9. I'm on the Target website. I've previously clicked Categories, Deals, Account/Sign in, and filled the search bar. Now, I need to enter a value into the search bar. The previous action was successful. Now I need to click the 'shoes' link to initiate a search for shoes and continue to explore the site's main features as per the goal.
    
        10. I have already navigated to the Target homepage and searched for 'shoes'. Now I will explore one of the suggested refinements to the search. Clicking on 'shoes organizer'.
    
        11. I am on the Target search suggestions page after having searched for 'shoes organizer'. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements, which I can continue doing by exploring the suggested searches. I will click on the 'shoes organizer hanging' suggestion.
