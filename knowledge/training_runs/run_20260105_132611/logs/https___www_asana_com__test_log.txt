        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by exploring the main features of the Asana website. Currently, I am on the homepage. Since there are no credentials available, I will skip logging in and instead explore publicly available features. I will start by clicking the "Product" button to explore the product features.
    
        2. I've landed on the Asana login screen, which is not the goal. I should explore the features of the site, so I will navigate to the 'Solutions' page to explore its offerings. Because I don't have credentials, I should avoid logging in.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Product' and 'Solutions'. Now I should click on 'Learning & Support' to continue exploring the main navigation options.
    
        4. I'm on the Asana landing page, and I've already clicked the 'Product', 'Solutions', and 'Learning & support' buttons. The next instruction from the user is to explore the main features, and I should click on 'Pricing' to explore that feature. Since I do not have credentials, I should NOT click Log In button. I will click Pricing button.
    
        5. I have already clicked on 'Product', 'Solutions', 'Learning & support', and 'Pricing' based on the history. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I am currently on the pricing page. Next, I will click on 'Contact sales' to explore that part of the site.
    
        6. I have already navigated to the sales page. Since this is a login screen, I will navigate to Asana's homepage to explore other features instead of trying to log in, as I do not have any credentials. I will click the 'Asana Home' button.
    
        7. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which involves navigating the site and exploring its main features. I have already clicked on 'Product', 'Solutions', 'Learning & Support', 'Pricing', 'Contact sales', and 'Asana Home' buttons. Now, I will scroll down the page to explore its key elements and features.
    
        8. I've already clicked through the main navigation items (Product, Solutions, Learning & Support, Pricing, Contact sales) and returned to the homepage. I have also scrolled down the page. As the goal is a smoke test, I will now explore one of the 'See more' links on the homepage to explore a specific feature in more detail. I will click the link for 'See campaign management'.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on the 'Product', 'Solutions', 'Learning & Support', 'Pricing', 'Contact sales' buttons, navigated back to Asana Home, scrolled down, and clicked on 'See campaign management'. Now I will click on 'View demo' to explore more of the site's features.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I am currently on the Asana Marketing Demo page. There is only one button on the screen. I will explore the footer links to further navigate the site.
    
        11. I am currently on the Asana Demo - Marketing page and a language selection modal is open. My goal is to perform a smoke test, so I should close the modal to continue exploring the main features of the page. I will click the 'X' link to close the modal.
    
        12. The current page has a modal open prompting the user to choose a language. I already tried closing it with the X button, but it's still there. I will try clicking on the "English" language option within the modal to dismiss it and continue with the smoke test.
    
        13. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. I've already clicked around the site quite a bit, including viewing a demo and changing the language. Now I will close the overlay to return to the main dashboard. The 'X' button (element 7) will close the overlay.
    
        14. I'm on a lead capture form. I don't have any credentials so I will just go back to the home page and explore from there. The current page is the Asana Marketing Demo page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since the previous action was dismissing the language selection, I should now go back to Asana Home.
    
        15. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I'm on the Asana homepage. I have already clicked around to a few different links. Now I will try clicking the 'Product' button to see the product dropdown.
    
        16. I am currently on the Asana landing page, and the goal is to explore main features. I have already clicked the "Product" button. Now I will click on "All Features" under the "Product" dropdown menu.
    
        17. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I am currently on the features page, according to page context. I should explore other parts of the page to continue the smoke test. I will click on Pricing to explore the pricing page.
    
        18. I am on the pricing page. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already navigated to the pricing page. Now I will click on the 'Product' button to navigate to the product page to explore the features.
    
        19. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have clicked on 'Product' button and the pricing page is displayed. Now, I will click the 'All features' button again to see if I can explore more features and key elements.
    
        20. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I'm currently on the Asana Features page. I've previously navigated to the 'All Features' page via the Product dropdown, and then to the 'Pricing' page, then back again. I will now click on the 'Tasks' link under the 'Tasks' section to further explore the site's features.
