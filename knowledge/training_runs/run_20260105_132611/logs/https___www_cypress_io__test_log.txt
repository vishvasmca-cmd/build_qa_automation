        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since there's a banner, I'll dismiss it first to have a clearer view of the main content. There are no credentials for login, so I'll avoid that.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already dismissed the banner. Now I will click on 'Products' to explore the product features.
    
        3. The goal is to explore main features. The previous action was clicking on 'Products'. I will now click on 'Docs' in the header to continue exploring features. This action should navigate to the documentation page.
    
        4. I'm currently on the Cypress Documentation page. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which involves navigating the site, exploring the main features, and verifying key elements. I need to explore the main features of the documentation site. Since I'm already on the documentation page, I should look for navigation elements within the documentation itself to explore its features.
    
        5. I have already navigated to the docs page and scrolled. Now I should explore the main features. I'll start by clicking on 'Core Concepts'.
    
        6. The goal is to explore the main features of the site. I have already navigated to the documentation and clicked on 'Core Concepts'. Now I will click on 'Guides' to explore another main feature.
    
        7. I am on the Cypress documentation page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked 'Core Concepts' and 'Guides'. Now, I'll click the 'Authentication Testing' button to explore another feature.
    
        8. I am on the documentation page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already explored 'Core Concepts', 'Guides', and 'Authentication Testing'. Now I will click the Cypress logo to return to the home page.
    
        9. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. The previous actions involved navigating to different sections and pages within the Cypress documentation. Now I'll click on the 'Learn' link in the header navigation to explore other main features.
    
        10. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which involves navigating the site and exploring main features. I have already navigated to the documentation site and clicked through a few main navigation links. Now I should click on other main links. The 'Learn' button looks like a good choice.
    
        11. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. I have already navigated the site, explored the main features, and verified key elements by clicking through the navigation. Since I've clicked on Learn twice in a row, I'll try clicking on 'Why Cypress?' to navigate to a new page and continue exploring.
    
        12. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, exploring main features. I've already navigated to the docs, clicked on core concepts, guides, authentication, Cypress logo, and Learn. Let's explore other main navigation items. I will now click on the 'API' link to navigate to the API documentation.
    
        13. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and exploring its main features. The previous action was clicking on the 'API' link, which led to the API documentation page. Now I will click on 'Commands' button to explore the list of Cypress commands, which is another main feature of the Cypress documentation site.
    
        14. I am currently on the Cypress API documentation page. I have already clicked on 'Commands'. Now I will click on one of the commands to explore the API documentation further. I will choose the 'and' command.
    
        15. I am currently on the 'and' command documentation page, and the goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I will now click the Cypress Logo to return to the homepage, as exploring the main navigation would be a good next step in exploring the main features of the website.
    
        16. The goal is to smoke test the Cypress site. I've already clicked on a few links. Now, I will click on the 'Cloud' link to explore another main feature.
    
        17. The current page is the Cypress Cloud 'Get Started' page, which appears to be a marketing page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already explored the 'Learn' and 'API' sections. Now, I will explore the 'App' section. It's important to ensure I am exploring different parts of the site.
    
        18. The goal is to explore the main features of the site. I have navigated to a few pages already based on the history. I will try clicking on UI Coverage to navigate to that page.
    
        19. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I'm currently on the UI Coverage introduction page, and the previous action was clicking the "UI Coverage" link in the navigation. Now I will click on the 'Get Started' button to explore this feature.
    
        20. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site by navigating and exploring main features. The current page is UI Coverage Documentation. I have already navigated to the UI Coverage documentation and clicked the 'Get Started' link. Now I will click on another link in the UI Coverage section to further explore the documentation.
