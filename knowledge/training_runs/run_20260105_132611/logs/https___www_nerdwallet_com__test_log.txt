        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore its main features. Since the page is the homepage, and I haven't done anything yet, I should start by clicking on one of the main navigation items. 'Credit cards' seems like a good starting point.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I previously clicked the 'Credit cards' button. Now I will click the 'Compare credit cards' link to explore another main feature.
    
        3. I have already navigated to the 'Compare Credit Cards' page. Now I want to explore the 'Banking' section. So I will click the Banking button.
    
        4. I have already navigated to the credit card comparison page and clicked on 'Banking'. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. Now, I will click on the 'Credit Cards' tab to verify the key elements for credit cards.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate and explore main features. The history shows I've clicked on 'Credit cards' and 'Compare credit cards' and then clicked 'Banking' followed by 'Credit cards' again. This looks like a loop. It's time to explore other main features. There are many options in the navigation bar, 'Loans' is a good option to explore next.
