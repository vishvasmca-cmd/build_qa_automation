        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I can start by clicking on one of the main navigation links, such as 'Banking'.
    
        2. The goal is to smoke test the site. I'm currently on the banking page. I will click the 'Home' link to navigate back to the homepage.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already clicked on Banking and then Home. Next, I'll explore a main feature by clicking on 'Credit cards'.
    
        4. The goal is 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. The history shows I've clicked 'Banking', 'Home', and 'Credit cards'. I will now click the 'Mortgage rates' link to explore another main feature of the site.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site, explore the main features and verify key elements. I have already navigated to Banking, Home, Credit Cards, and Mortgage Rates. Now I will navigate to Loans to explore another main feature.
    
        6. I am on the loans page and the goal is to smoke test the site by exploring main features. The previous actions successfully navigated to the loans page. Now I will click the 'Auto loans' button to navigate to the Auto loans page.
    
        7. I am on the Bankrate Auto Loans Page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already navigated to the auto loans page. I will now click on the 'Auto loan rates' link to explore one of the main features.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features and verify key elements. I am currently on the auto loan rates page. I will now click on the 'Auto loan calculator' link to explore another feature.
    
        9. I've navigated to the auto loan calculator page. The goal is to perform a smoke test, and exploring the main features of the current page is part of it. I will fill the 'amount' input, which has id 38. I will enter 20000 as the value to simulate a user interacting with the calculator.
    
        10. I'm on the Auto Loan Calculator page. The goal is to perform a smoke test which involves navigating the site and exploring key features. The previous action was filling the 'amount' field. Now I will fill in the 'interest-rate' field to explore the calculator's functionality.
    
        11. I've navigated to the auto loan calculator, and filled in the amount and interest rate. Now I need to explore other main features, like clicking on the 'Home' button.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already navigated to the home page twice, explored credit cards, mortgage rates, loans, and auto loan calculator. Now I will explore banking.
    
        13. The goal is to smoke test the website by exploring main features and verifying key elements. I'm currently on the Banking page, so I will click on 'CDs' to navigate to the CDs page.
    
        14. I have successfully navigated to the 'CDs' section under 'Banking'. The next step is to explore the main features and verify key elements on this page. I will click on the 'Best CD Rates' link to explore CD rates further.
    
        15. The goal is an autonomous smoke test. The last action clicked on 'Best CD Rates'. Let's click on the 'CD Calculator' to explore another feature on the page.
    
        16. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the website. The history shows I have navigated to the CD calculator page. Now, I will interact with the elements on the page to explore its features. I will start by filling out the 'Initial Deposit' input field.
    
        17. I am on the CD calculator page. The last action was filling the initial deposit amount. Now I need to fill the term of the CD.
