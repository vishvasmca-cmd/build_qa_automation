        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I'm on the login screen, but I don't have credentials. I should skip the login and explore publicly available areas. I will start by exploring the 'Kata Library' link in the footer, which seems like a core feature.
    
        2. I have already clicked on Kata Library. I should now explore another main feature. I will click on the Leaderboard link.
    
        3. I am on the login screen, but I don't have credentials to log in. The goal is to smoke test the site and explore the main features. Since I can't log in, I will click on the 'Blog' link in the navigation to explore publicly accessible content.
    
        4. I am on the Codewars Blog page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already navigated to the Blog page. Now I should explore the elements on the page. I will click on the 'Author's Corner' link.
    
        5. I am currently on the Author's Corner blog page. The goal is to explore the site's main features. I have already clicked on Kata Library, Leaderboard, Blog and Author's Corner. I will now click on 'For Educators' to continue exploring.
    
        6. I am currently on the Codewars Partnerships page, which is a login screen. The goal is to perform a smoke test, exploring the main features. Since I don't have credentials, I will avoid logging in and instead explore a public link. I will navigate to the 'About' page to continue exploration.
    
        7. I am currently on the Partnerships page, which also seems to be serving as a login screen. I have already clicked several links from the home page. The overall goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since there are no credentials available in test_data, I will skip login and navigate to the 'Kata Library' again to continue exploration.
    
        8. I am on the Partnerships page, which is also a login screen. I am trying to do autonomous smoke tests, so I will skip the login screen and find other main features. The previous action was clicking 'Kata Library' but from the partnerships page. I will click the home button to explore the main features of the site, now that I am on a secondary page.
    
        9. I'm on the homepage/login screen. Since the goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features, and there are no credentials, I will click on the 'Kata Library' to explore coding challenges without logging in.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already navigated to several pages. The current page is the login screen. Since there are no credentials available, I will avoid logging in and explore public pages. Clicking on the 'Join' button will navigate to the registration page, which is a valid public page to explore.
    
        11. I am currently on the join page. I do not have test data to create an account. I will explore public links instead of creating an account to smoke test the application. I will click on the 'About' link.
    
        12. I am on the signup page, since the URL is codewars.com/about. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have not been provided with test data and am on a sign up page. Therefore, I will navigate to the contact us page to explore main features.
    
        13. I'm currently on the 'About' page, which reloads after I click on the 'Contact' button in the history. I'm going to click the 'SIGN UP' button and explore the registration page in pursuit of the overall smoke test goal.
    
        14. I am currently on the sign-up page. I should avoid signing up since I have no test credentials. Instead, I will click on the 'About' link in the footer to continue exploring the site. This progresses the 'explore main features' part of the goal.
    
        15. I am on the registration page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since there are no credentials available in test_data, I should skip the registration process and explore other parts of the page, like the footer links. I will click on the 'API' link in the footer.
    
        16. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I'm currently on the login screen. Since there are no credentials available, I should explore publicly accessible features. I will click on 'Practice' to explore the Kata challenges.
    
        17. I'm currently on the Codewars Profile Page of a logged-in user. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I will now click the Kata link.
    
        18. I am on the profile page, which is a logged-in state. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features and verify key elements. I've already clicked through several links. Now I will click the 'Collections' link.
    
        19. I am currently on the Authored Collections page of the user profile. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already navigated to the Kata Library, Join page, About page, Contact page, SIGN UP page, API page, Practice page, Kata page, and Collections page. There doesn't seem to be an obvious 'main feature' I haven't explored yet. I'll click around on some of the other links in the footer. I'll try 'Blog' next. I am already on the Authored Collections page, so there are no other main navigation links available.
    
        20. I am on the Authored Collections page. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I've already clicked on several links in the footer and navigation. Now I will click on the 'Stats' link in the navigation to see user stats.
