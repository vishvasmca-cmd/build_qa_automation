        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since I'm on the login screen and I don't have any credentials, I will skip login and instead explore publicly available features like the 'Catalog' button.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I previously clicked the "Catalog" button. Now, I will explore different course topics. I will click on the "Course topics" button to explore them.
    
        3. I have already clicked on 'Catalog' and 'Course topics'. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I will click on 'Live learning' button to explore another feature.
    
        4. I am on the Codecademy homepage, and my goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I've already clicked 'Catalog', 'Course topics', and 'Live learning'. Now I will click on 'Skill paths'.
    
        5. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features. I've already clicked 'Catalog', 'Course topics', 'Live learning', and 'Skill paths'. Next, I should click on 'Career paths' to continue exploring the main navigation items.
    
        6. I have already clicked on the 'Catalog', 'Course topics', 'Live learning', 'Skill paths', and 'Career paths' buttons. Now I will click on the 'Certification paths' button.
    
        7. I am currently on the Codecademy homepage, which appears to be a login screen. I have already clicked 'Catalog', 'Course topics', 'Live learning', 'Skill paths', 'Career paths', and 'Certification paths'. The next element to explore is 'Resources'. I will click the 'Resources' button to continue exploring the site's main features.
    
        8. I have already explored the main navigation links in the header. Now, I will explore the available courses in the main section.
    
        9. I have already explored the catalog and resources. Now I will click the 'Docs' button to explore the documentation. This will allow me to explore the main features of the website.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features, performing a smoke test. I have clicked on Catalog, Resources and some sub-elements already. Now I will explore main features by clicking on Community.
    
        11. I am on the C++ documentation page, which is part of exploring the main features of the site. The history shows that I have already clicked through several options in the main navigation. Since I am on a documentation page, I will explore the 'Topics' and 'Related learning' buttons to see where they lead. I'll start by clicking the 'Topics' button.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I am currently on the C++ documentation page. The history shows I've already clicked on multiple links. Now, I will try to navigate the 'Topics' to explore more of the page.
    
        13. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, exploring the site and verifying key elements. I am currently on the C++ documentation page. I have already clicked on several items. Now I will explore other items on this page. I will click on the Pricing button.
    
        14. The smoke test goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already navigated to the documentation page and clicked on 'Community', 'Topics', and 'Pricing'. Now I'll click on 'Catalog' to explore another main feature.
    
        15. I have already clicked through several main navigation options. Let's try the 'Course topics' button to explore the available courses. This action contributes to exploring the main features of the site, as mentioned in the goal.
    
        16. I have already navigated to the C++ documentation page and explored several buttons. The next step is to explore main features and verify key elements. The button 'Skill paths' will help explore more features on the website.
    
        17. I am on the C++ documentation page. I have already clicked on several elements including Resources, Python, Docs, Community, Topics, Pricing, Catalog, Course Topics, and Skill paths. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Now I will click on 'Career paths' to explore another main feature.
    
        18. I am on the C++ documentation page. I have already clicked on the main navigation links like 'Catalog', 'Course topics', 'Skill paths', and 'Career paths'. The goal is to explore the main features, so now I will try clicking on 'Certification paths'.
    
        19. I have already clicked on several main navigation buttons like Docs, Community, Topics, Pricing, Catalog, Course topics, Skill paths, Career paths, and Certification paths. Now, let's explore the 'Resources' button to further navigate the site and explore its main features.
    
        20. I am on the Codecademy Docs page, specifically for C++. The goal is to smoke test the site. I have clicked on several elements already. Now I will click on 'Learning tools' to see where it leads. This should explore a main feature of the site, as requested by the goal.
