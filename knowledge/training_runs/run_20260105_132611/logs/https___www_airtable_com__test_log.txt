        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate and explore the site. The page context says I'm on the homepage. I will start by clicking on the 'Pricing' link in the header to explore the site's features.
    
        2. I am on the pricing page, and the goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I will start by clicking on the 'Platform' link in the header to explore that section.
    
        3. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, which includes exploring main features and verifying key elements. The current page is the pricing page. I've already clicked on 'Pricing' and 'Platform'. I will now click on 'Solutions' to further explore the site's features.
    
        4. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked on 'Pricing', 'Platform', and 'Solutions'. Now I will click 'Resources' to further explore main features.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Pricing', 'Platform', 'Solutions', and 'Resources'. Now, I will click on 'Airtable home or view your bases' to navigate to the home page. This action will move us closer to exploring the main features.
    
        6. I have clicked through the main navigation links (Pricing, Platform, Solutions, Resources) and then went back to the homepage. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. Since I am back on the landing page which displays a login screen and there are no credentials available, I will explore other options available to me. Scrolling down the page might reveal other publicly available links.
    
        7. I've already clicked on the main navigation items and scrolled once. Now, I'll close the promo banner to see if it reveals any more elements to explore. This aligns with the goal to navigate and explore the main features of the site.
    
        8. I have already clicked through main navigation buttons, scrolled and closed the promo banner. Now I will explore 'AI Plays' to further navigate the site.
    
        9. The goal is to explore the main features of the site. I have already clicked the main navigation items and 'Explore AI Plays', so I'll click 'Thoughtcast Builders & Breakthroughs' link.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to the 'Builders & Breakthroughs' page. Now I will click on the first episode to explore the main features.
    
        11. I'm on the Airtable Breakthroughs page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore its main features. I have already clicked 'Watch episode', and since this is a smoke test, I want to avoid potentially getting stuck on a video page. Instead, I will click the Airtable Home link to get back to the main page and then explore other features.
    
        12. I have already clicked through several parts of the home page, including the promo banner and some featured content. The next logical step is to explore the footer links. Since the element list is empty (which is an error), I will scroll down the page to hopefully load the footer, then examine the page context again. I will then trigger another planning cycle.
    
        13. The smoke test involves navigating the site and exploring main features. The previous actions include clicking on 'Solutions', 'Resources', and 'Airtable home' button, closing the promo banner, and exploring AI plays and Thoughtcast. Now I will click on pricing to explore another main feature.
    
        14. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already navigated to the pricing page. Since I don't have credentials, I should avoid logging in. I can now check the links in the footer.
    
        15. I am on the pricing page. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I will click on the 'Platform' button to navigate to the platform page.
    
        16. I am on the Airtable Pricing page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already scrolled and clicked on the "Platform" button. Now I will click on "Platform Features" to explore more about it.
    
        17. I have already navigated to the Pricing page and clicked on "Platform Features". Now, I should explore other main features as per the instructions in the goal. Since the 'Solutions' button is available in the header, and I have not clicked it before, I will click it to explore the Solutions section.
    
        18. The goal is to navigate and explore main features. I have already explored the 'Platform' and 'Solutions' buttons. Next, I will explore the 'Resources' button.
    
        19. I have already clicked on 'Resources' on the pricing page. Now I will click on one of the links listed under the Resources section which will fulfill the goal of exploring the main features and verifying key elements on the site. I will click on 'Airtable Academy'.
    
        20. I am on the Airtable Pricing page. I have explored the 'Platform', 'Solutions', and 'Resources' menus by clicking buttons. The goal is to continue exploring main features of the site. Since there is no login data available, I will continue exploring publicly accessible links, like 'Developers Docs'
