📡 Sending 685 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I have already clicked 'Products', 'Framework', 'Resources', and 'Search'. Now I should click on 'Get Started' to further explore the site's main features as per the goal description. However, I don't see that button in the list. The 'spatial_verification' in the page_context says that there are 5 visible buttons that aren't in the list, including 'Get Started' and 'Start deploying'. Since I can't see those buttons, I will click the Docs link, which is visible.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("link", { name: "Docs" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=23 (Docs)
   👉 Locator failed. Using coordinate fallback.

        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I am on the landing page. I will click on the 'Products' button to explore the products section. This is a smoke test, so exploring different sections of the website will help verify key elements.
    
        2. I have already clicked on 'Products' button in the last turn. The next step is to further explore main features. I will click the 'Framework' button to explore more.
    
        3. I have already clicked on 'Products' and 'Framework'. Now, I will click on 'Resources' to continue exploring the main features of the website.
    
        4. I have already clicked on the 'Products', 'Framework', and 'Resources' buttons. Now I will click on the 'Search' button to explore another main feature of the website.
    
        5. I have already clicked 'Products', 'Framework', 'Resources', and 'Search'. Now I should click on 'Get Started' to further explore the site's main features as per the goal description. However, I don't see that button in the list. The 'spatial_verification' in the page_context says that there are 5 visible buttons that aren't in the list, including 'Get Started' and 'Start deploying'. Since I can't see those buttons, I will click the Docs link, which is visible.
    
        6. I have already clicked 'Products', 'Framework', 'Resources', 'Search', and 'Docs' buttons. Now I will click the 'Packages' button to explore another main feature of the site. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features.
    
        7. I have already clicked on 'Products', 'Framework', 'Resources', 'Search (Ctrl+K)', 'Docs', and 'Packages'. Now I will click on 'Starter Kits' to continue exploring the main features.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore its main features. I've already clicked on 'Products', 'Framework', 'Resources', 'Search', 'Docs', 'Packages', and 'Starter Kits'. Now I will click on the "Home" button.
    
        9. I have already clicked the 'Home', 'Starter Kits', 'Packages', 'Docs', 'Search', 'Resources', 'Framework', and 'Products' buttons. Now, I will click on the 'Laravel Wrapped is here. Check out everything you shipped in 2025' to explore the website. It may contain some new information for developers.
