        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I am starting on the login screen and no login credentials were provided, I will explore the 'Products' section to avoid logging in and still fulfill the goal of exploring the site.
    
        2. I have already clicked on the "Products" link, and now I am on the products page. The next step in my goal is to explore the main features. I will click on the first "Add to cart" button on the page. This will allow me to proceed to the cart and explore further functionalities.
    
        3. I'm currently on the products page, and I've already clicked 'Add to cart' once. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I will add another item to the cart to further explore the product page features.
    
        4. I have navigated to the products page, and added two items to the cart. Now I will explore another main feature which is the cart. I will click on the cart button to view the cart.
    
        5. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, exploring main features and verifying key elements. The history shows that I've navigated to the products page, added products to the cart, and then navigated to the cart page. Now, I'll explore the 'Test Cases' page to verify its key elements.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows that I have already navigated to the products page, added items to the cart, viewed the cart, and navigated to the test cases page. Now I should explore other features. I will navigate to the 'API Testing' page.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on the 'Products' page, added items to the cart, visited the cart, navigated to test cases, and API testing pages. Next, I will go to the 'Contact us' page to explore another main feature.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on Products, added two items to cart, clicked on Cart, Test Cases, API Testing and Contact Us. The next logical step is to click on Video Tutorials to continue exploring main features.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on Products, Cart, Test Cases, API Testing, Contact us, and Video Tutorials. Now I will go to the Home page to explore more features.
    
        10. I have already navigated to the Products page, added items to the cart, and clicked on 'Cart', 'Test Cases', 'API Testing', 'Contact us', 'Video Tutorials', and 'Home'. I will now click on 'Signup / Login' to explore another main feature.
