        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to smoke test the site, and I am currently on the login screen. I don't have any credentials to log in with. Since the instruction is to explore public areas if no credentials are provided, I will skip the login process and click the first available course to proceed.
    
        2. The previous action was to click on 'Generative AI in Practice'. I need to explore the main features and verify key elements. Since I am on the login screen and have no credentials, I will click on 'See more options' to see if there are publicly accessible features.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on the 'Generative AI in Practice' link and the 'See more options' link. The current page is the promotional page for the course, I will proceed with exploring publicly accessible areas instead of logging in since I don't have credentials. I'll try clicking on the 'Courses' link to navigate to the courses page.
    
        4. I have completed a few navigation steps already. The goal is 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. I'll pick another course to explore. The last course I clicked was Generative AI in Practice. This time, I'll click on 'Introduction to Python'.
    
        5. I am on the Sololearn platform, and I'm logged in. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since I'm already in a course, I will explore the footer links 'Privacy' and 'Terms' to fulfill the 'explore main features' part of the goal. I will start with 'Privacy'.
    
        6. I am on the login screen but I don't have credentials. The goal is to navigate and explore. Therefore, I will skip login and explore the courses listed on the page.
    
        7. The goal is to smoke test the website. I am currently on the Sololearn website. The page context indicates a login screen, but the spatial verification doesn't list any buttons. I see links 'Privacy' and 'Terms'. Since I do not have login credentials, I will click on the 'Terms' link to continue exploring the website.
    
        8. The current page is the login screen, but I do not have any login credentials, therefore I will try to navigate to the courses page to start exploring main features.
    
        9. I am on the login page and I do not have any credentials in test_data. As per instructions, I will skip log in and try to find publicly accessible areas of the site. I will click on the 'Create an account' link.
    
        10. I am on the sign-up page. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features and verify key elements. Since no credentials are provided, I will skip signing up and instead click on the 'Log in' link to see if the login page is accessible. This allows me to continue exploring the site without needing to create an account.
    
        11. I am currently on the login page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since no credentials are provided in test_data, I will skip the login for now and explore other areas. I'll click on 'Create an account' to explore the sign-up page, which is a publicly accessible area.
    
        12. I am on the sign-up page. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the website, explore main features, and verify key elements. I don't have test data to sign up. So I should explore other links on the page. I will click on the 'Terms of Use' link in the footer.
    
        13. I am on the signup page, and I have no elements to interact with. Since the goal is to smoke test the site and there are no elements to click, I need to navigate to another page. Since I can't create an account and I don't want to login without credentials, I should go back to the home page to continue testing.
    
        14. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I've already navigated to the home page and clicked around a little bit. The page context indicates that I'm now on a login screen. Since there are no credentials in the `test_data`, I will not attempt to log in. Instead, I'll click the 'Explore full catalog' link to navigate away from the login screen and continue exploring the site's features.
    
        15. I'm currently on the SoloLearn landing page, logged in. The goal is an autonomous smoke test. I've already clicked through some links in the footer, tried creating accounts and logging in, navigated back to the home page and explored the catalog. Now, I should explore other main features. Since I don't have a specific next step, I'll click on the Privacy link, since I have not clicked it yet.
    
        16. I am on the login screen, and I need to explore main features. Since I do not have credentials, I should skip logging in. Instead, I should look for publicly accessible areas. There are many course options on the page and I will click on the 'Generative AI in Practice' course.
    
        17. I am on the course landing page for 'Generative AI in Practice'. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I am already on a course page, which can be considered exploring a main feature. I will click the 'Take the free course' button to proceed further.
    
        18. I am on the login/signup page for the Generative AI in Practice course. Since I do not have any credentials in the test data, I will skip the login/signup process and explore the courses page by clicking the 'Courses' link.
    
        19. I am on the courses page. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already clicked on the 'Courses' link in the navbar. Now, I will click on the 'All Courses' button to further explore the course catalog.
    
        20. I am on the 'Learn' page, which lists all available courses. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked the 'All Courses' button in the previous step. I will now click on the 'Programming Foundations' button to explore another category of courses.
