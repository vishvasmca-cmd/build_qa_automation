        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The current page is the Playwright homepage. I will start by clicking the 'Docs' link to explore the documentation, a main feature of the site.
    
        2. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features. The previous step was to click on 'Docs'. Now, I will click on the 'API' link in the main navigation to explore another key area of the site.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked 'Docs' and 'API'. Now I will click 'Community' to explore another main feature.
    
        4. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows that the 'Docs', 'API' and 'Community' links have been visited. The next logical step would be to click on one of the other main navigation links, such as 'Blog'.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked Docs, API, Community, and Blog. Now I will click on Learn Videos under videos section to continue exploring the site.
    
        6. I have already navigated to the Docs, API, Community, Blog, and Learn Videos pages. Now I need to explore other main features. I will click on the 'Feature Videos' link to see what that page contains.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site, explore the main features, and verify key elements. I've already clicked on Docs, API, Community, Blog, Learn Videos, and Feature Videos. Next I will click on one of the feature videos to explore the UI. There are several videos listed, I'll pick the first one to keep it simple. This should navigate to a page to play the selected video.
    
        8. The current goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already clicked on Docs, API, Community, Blog, Learn Videos, Feature Videos, and Watch Playwright Testing Agents. Now I will click on the "Watch Debugging with AI" button to continue exploring the main features. This action moves us closer to completing the smoke test by exploring more of the site's features.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked through the Docs, API, Community, Blog, Learn Videos, Feature Videos, watched the 'Playwright Testing Agents' video, and the 'Debugging with AI' video. I'll continue exploring the videos on the page by clicking the next 'Watch' button.
    
        10. I'm on the Feature Videos page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have clicked a few of the main nav links, as well as some of the 'Watch' buttons. There are more 'Watch' buttons to click to explore more features.
    
        11. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on 'Docs', 'API', 'Community', 'Blog', 'Learn Videos', 'Feature Videos', 'Watch Playwright Testing Agents: under the hood', 'Watch Debugging with AI', 'Watch API Mocking', 'Watch Trace Viewer'. So, I should continue to explore the other main features on this page, like 'Github', 'Discord', 'Twitter', etc.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate and explore the site. I have already clicked on API, Community, Blog, Learn Videos, Feature Videos, and watched/clicked on several of the videos displayed as well as the GitHub link in the footer. I will explore the footer links further. Clicking on YouTube next.
    
        13. I have already navigated to the Feature Videos page and clicked several videos and footer links. I will now click the 'Docs' link to explore another main feature of the site.
    
        14. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked through several links under the Community tab. Now I am on the Docs page (https://playwright.dev/docs/intro), so I will click on 'API' to explore another main feature.
    
        15. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked the Docs and API links. Now I will click the Community link to explore that section of the site.
    
        16. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the Playwright site. I've already navigated to the community page, explored the feature videos, and clicked on Docs and API links. Now, I'll explore the 'Blog' link to check if it is working correctly.
    
        17. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Based on the history, I have already clicked on 'Docs', 'API', 'Community' and 'Blog'. I will click on 'Videos' now to explore that part of the site.
    
        18. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on Docs, API, Community, Blog and Videos. I will now explore the 'Ambassadors' page to further explore the main features of the website.
    
        19. I have explored several main features including Docs, API, Community, Blog, Videos, and Ambassadors pages. It seems like I've exhausted most of the main navigation options. To fulfill the goal of 'verifying key elements,' I will explore the 'Learn Playwright' link, which might lead to important content and elements related to playwright learning.
    
        20. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked through multiple links in the navigation and main page. Now, I will click on the 'Search' button to explore the search functionality.
