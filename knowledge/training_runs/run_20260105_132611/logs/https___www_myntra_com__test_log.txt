💭 Thought: The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. The first step was to navigate to the site, which was successful. However, the current page displays an error message, and there are no interactive elements available. Therefore, the best course of action is to refresh the page to see if the error resolves itself. This will help in determining if the error is persistent or transient.
