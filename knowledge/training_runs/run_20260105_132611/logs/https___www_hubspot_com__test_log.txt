🚀 Explorer: Starting Strategy 2026. Goal: Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements

--- Step 1 ---
🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.hubspot.com/
📍 On Page: HubSpot
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 332 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The page context indicates that I am on the HubSpot homepage, which is a login screen. My goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I don't have any credentials, I will skip the login process and instead explore publicly available areas. I will start by accepting cookies to dismiss the cookie banner.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("button", { name: "Accept All" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=5 (Accept all)
💾 Trace saved to projects/https___www_hubspot_com__regression/outputs/trace.json
💾 Passive Collection: 332 elements saved.

--- Step 2 ---
🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.hubspot.com/
📍 On Page: HubSpot
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 323 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The goal is to perform a smoke test of the HubSpot site. I've already accepted the cookies. Now, I need to explore the main features. I am on the homepage, so I should click on one of the main navigation items like 'Products', 'Solutions', or 'Resources'. I will start with 'Products'.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("button", { name: "Products" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=32 (Products)
💾 Trace saved to projects/https___www_hubspot_com__regression/outputs/trace.json
💾 Passive Collection: 323 elements saved.

--- Step 3 ---
🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.hubspot.com/
📍 On Page: HubSpot
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 323 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The previous action clicked on the 'Products' button. Now, I will click on the 'Marketing Hub' link to explore one of the main products. Since I am on the homepage, this will take me to the marketing hub landing page.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("link", { name: "Learn more about Marketing Hub software" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=68 (Learn more about Marketing Hub software)
💾 Trace saved to projects/https___www_hubspot_com__regression/outputs/trace.json
💾 Passive Collection: 323 elements saved.

--- Step 4 ---
🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing?hubs_content=www.hubspot.com&hubs_content-cta=homepage-marketing
📍 On Page: HubSpot Marketing Hub
🤔 State: dashboard
📡 Sending 0 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to the Marketing Hub page. Since there are no interactive elements to click on in the current state, I will mark this step as complete.
✅ Goal Achieved!
