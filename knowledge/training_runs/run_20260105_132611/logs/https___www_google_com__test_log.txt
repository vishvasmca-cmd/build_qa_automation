        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I am currently on the Google Search landing page which is a login screen. Since I don't have any credentials in test_data, I will skip the login and instead explore the main features by first clicking on 'About' to navigate to the About page.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I already clicked on the 'About' link in the previous step. Now I will click on 'Store' to explore another main feature of the site.
    
        3. I am on the Google About page. The history shows I previously clicked on 'About' and then 'Store'. There are no interactive elements currently available in the JSON. Since my goal is to explore main features and verify key elements, I will navigate back to the home page using the browser's back button, since there are no forward facing actionable elements.
    
        4. I am on the Google About page. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site by navigating and exploring its main features. The history shows I've clicked 'About' and 'Store'. Now, let's explore other main navigation items such as 'Products'.
    
        5. I have already navigated to the products page. The overall goal is to perform a smoke test which entails navigating to the main features and validating elements. I will now click on the "Product support" link.
    
        6. I have already navigated to the products page, and clicked on 'Product support'. Now I want to explore more main features. I will click on 'Google Store' button to navigate to Google Store page.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked on 'About', 'Store', 'Products', 'Product support', and 'Google Store'. Now I will click on 'Google Account' to explore another main feature.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked 'About', 'Store', 'Products', 'Product Support', 'Google Store', and 'Google Account'. Now, I will click 'Accessibility support' to further explore the main features.
    
        9. I have already clicked 'About', 'Store', 'Products', 'Product support', 'Google Store', 'Google Account', and 'Accessibility support'. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I will now click on 'Download the Google app'.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked through the main elements at the top of the page. Now I will click on the products again to explore the content on the page.
    
        11. I've explored some of the product links at the top of the page and also the footer links. Now I'll click on one of the main features, 'AI Mode', to further explore the site.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate the site and explore its main features. I have already clicked on several links on the page. Now I will click on the 'About' link to explore another part of the site.
    
        13. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements on the site. I've navigated to the about page in the previous step. Now I will click on the 'Products' link to explore Google's products.
    
        14. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, exploring main features and verifying key elements. Based on the history, I have already clicked on several of the footer links and the Products link. The current page is the Google Products page. I will now click on the 'How Search Works' link to explore a different section of the site.
    
        15. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I have already clicked several links on the page. Now I will click on the LENS section to explore it.
    
        16. I have clicked on multiple elements already, and the goal is to explore main features. Since I have explored many links already, I will now click the 'Pause animation' button to interact with the page and verify key elements.
    
        17. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on several elements. Let's click on 'Company Info' to continue exploring.
    
        18. I am currently on the 'Company Info' page, according to the page title. The goal is to 'Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. I have already clicked on 'Company Info'. Now, I will click on 'News' to explore another main feature.
    
        19. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The previous action was clicking on 'News'. Now I will explore the 'Careers' section.
    
        20. I've already navigated to the page and explored a number of links. The next logical step is to explore the 'Locations' link to see where Google operates. This aligns with the goal of exploring main features of the site.
