        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since I am on the homepage, I can start by exploring the 'Personal' features of the website. Therefore, I will click on the 'Personal' button.
    
        2. The current goal is 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. The previous action clicked on the 'Personal' button. Now, I will explore another main feature by clicking on 'Send Money'.
    
        3. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements of the site. I've already clicked on 'Personal' and 'Send Money'. Now, let's explore the 'Receive' feature on the homepage.
    
        4. The goal is to explore the main features. I have already clicked on 'Personal', 'Send Money' and 'Receive'. I will now click on 'Split' to continue exploring main features.
    
        5. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, navigating the site and exploring main features. I have already clicked on 'Personal', 'Send Money', 'Receive' and 'Split'. I will now click on 'Pool'. This will allow me to explore another main feature on the page.
    
        6. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already clicked on Personal, Send Money, Receive, Split, and Pool buttons. Now, I should close the cookie consent banner to have a clearer view of the page and continue exploring the main features. The banner is obstructing the page, so I will click on the 'Close' button to dismiss it.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site, explore the main features and verify the key elements. I have already clicked through the 'Personal' button, and then explored the 'Send Money', 'Receive', 'Split', and 'Pool' buttons. It seems I need to start exploring other main features. I will click the 'Business' button to explore business features.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows that I have clicked on several features already (Personal, Send Money, Receive, Split, Pool, and Business). Now I will click on 'Help' to explore another main feature of the site.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Personal', 'Send Money', 'Receive', 'Split', 'Pool', 'Business', and 'Help'. Now I will click 'Sign Up' to explore another feature.
    
        10. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I have already clicked through the main buttons in the hero area, including Personal, Send Money, Receive, Split, Pool, Business, Help, and Sign Up. Now I will click on the PayPal logo to return to the homepage and explore the footer links.
    
        11. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the website, exploring main features and verifying key elements. I have already clicked on different buttons and links on the page. Now I will click on the 'Business' button to explore the business section of the website.
    
        12. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring its main features. I have already clicked 'Send Money', 'Receive', 'Split', 'Pool', 'Close', 'Business', 'Help', 'Sign Up', 'PayPal logo', and 'Business' again. Now I will click on 'Personal' to explore that aspect of the site.
    
        13. I have navigated back to the homepage, clicked Business, and clicked Personal. Now I will click on Developer to navigate to the developer section of the website to fulfill the goal of exploring main features.
    
        14. The current page is the PayPal Developer login screen, according to the page context. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features, but I don't have credentials. Instead of attempting to log in, I'll explore the 'Learn more' option to see publicly available information.
    
        15. The previous action failed, because the target element was not found in the DOM. Since the current goal is to do a smoke test and the page is a login screen and I do not have any credentials, I will explore publicly available documentation. Therefore, I will click on the 'Read documentation' button to navigate to the documentation page.
    
        16. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features, and the last action successfully navigated to the Fastlane resource center. The page context indicates a login screen. Since there are no credentials, I will explore the links on the page.
    
        17. The current page is the login screen for Fastlane by PayPal. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring the main features. Since `test_data` does not contain credentials, I will avoid logging in and instead explore the publically available elements. I will navigate to the 'Docs' section, to continue exploring the website.
    
        18. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements of the site. I've already navigated to a specific documentation page (PayPal Complete Payment Integration Guide). Now, I will click on the 'APIs & SDKs' link in the navigation bar to explore a different section of the site.
    
        19. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already navigated to the developer documentation, then clicked on APIs & SDKs. Now I need to pick a specific API or SDK to explore. I will choose REST APIs.
