        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I will start by clicking on 'Interview Prep' to explore that section.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The previous action was clicking on 'Interview Prep'. Now, I will click on the 'Tutorials' button to continue exploring the site.
    
        3. I have already clicked on 'Interview Prep' and 'Tutorials'. Now I will click on 'Tracks'.
    
        4. I've already clicked on 'Interview Prep', 'Tutorials', and 'Tracks'. Now I will try clicking 'Courses'.
    
        5. I am on the courses page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I am already on the courses page from the history, I will click on 'View All' to explore more courses.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on Interview Prep, Tutorials, Tracks, Courses, and View All. Now I'll click on one of the course cards to explore a course.
    
        7. I have already clicked on several elements ('Interview Prep', 'Tutorials', 'Tracks', 'Courses', 'View All', and a specific DSA course). Now, I will click on the 'Read more' button to expand the description of the course.
    
        8. I've already navigated to the course page and clicked 'Read more'. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I'll click 'Read more' again to see if more content is revealed, which helps in exploring the course page further.
    
        9. I am currently on the GeeksforGeeks DSA Self-Paced Course page. I have already clicked on 'Interview Prep', 'Tutorials', 'Tracks', 'Courses', 'View All', and the DSA self-paced course, and then 'Read More' twice. Since I have explored the main features, I will now try to verify the key elements. Since I am not logged in, I should avoid elements that require login. I will download the course brochure to continue exploring the page's main features. This action does not require login.
    
        10. I have already navigated to the DSA Self-Paced course page and explored it by clicking on 'Read more' twice and 'Course Brochure'. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features. Since I am on the course page, I will explore other options like All Courses and Self-Paced. I will now click on 'All Courses'.
    
        11. I have already navigated to the DSA Self-Paced course page. Now I will explore other main features. I will click on 'Self-Paced' link. Although I am already on this page, clicking the link again will at least verify that the link works and doesn't lead to an error.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The history shows a series of clicks on the main navigation. Since the page context indicates that the site is showing courses, I will try to go to the home page to see the main features and verify elements.
    
        13. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I will click on the 'Interview Prep' button to explore that section.
    
        14. I am on the GeeksforGeeks homepage. I have already clicked on Courses, View All, a specific course, 'Read More' twice, 'Course Brochure', 'All Courses', 'Self-Paced', and 'geeksforgeeks' and 'Interview Prep'. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I will now click on the Tutorials button to explore a different section of the website.
    
        15. I have already clicked on Interview Prep and Tutorials. Now I will explore the Tracks feature to smoke test the site and verify key elements.
    
        16. I have already clicked on 'Interview Prep', 'Tutorials', and 'Tracks'. Now, I will explore the 'DSA' link to navigate the site further as part of the autonomous smoke test.
    
        17. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already clicked through several links on the homepage including courses and tutorials. Now I will explore 'Algorithms' from the tutorials section.
    
        18. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. I have navigated to the DSA tutorial page. Now, I will click on 'Interview Prep' to explore other features.
    
        19. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I've already navigated to the page and clicked on 'Interview Prep' again. Now I will click on the 'Tutorials' element with id 9 to continue exploring the site's features.
    
        20. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which includes navigating the site and exploring main features. I have previously clicked on 'Interview Prep' and 'Tutorials'. Now I will click on any other options on the page like 'Quizzes', 'Must Do', 'Advanced DSA', 'System Design', 'Aptitude' or 'Puzzles'. I will start with 'Quizzes'.
