        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements of the Angular.dev website. I'll start by clicking the 'Get Started' button as an entry point to the documentation/tutorials.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already clicked the "Get Started" button. Now I will click on the 'Docs' link to explore documentation features.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked on 'Get Started' and 'Docs'. Now I will click on 'Tutorials' to continue exploring the main features.
    
        4. I have already clicked 'Get Started', 'Docs' and 'Tutorials'. Now I will click the playground button to explore the playground feature.
    
        5. I have already navigated to Docs, Tutorials, and Playground. Now I will click on 'Reference' to explore another main feature as per the smoke test goal.
    
        6. I have already clicked on the main navigation items (Docs, Tutorials, Playground, Reference). Now I will click on the "Learn more about how Google uses cookies" to accept the privacy policy.
    
        7. I've clicked through the main navigation and the cookie notice. Now I'll explore the API Reference page further by clicking on 'API Reference' button to see if it leads to a different section or filters the content.
    
        8. I have already navigated to the API Reference page, now I will explore the main features by clicking on the first API package, which is @angular/animations.
    
        9. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. I've already clicked through several main navigation elements. Now, I will select another angular module from the API Reference to explore more of the available features. I'll choose @angular/animations/browser to continue exploration.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows that I have navigated to the API Reference and explored the animations/browser package. Now, I will go back to the main API Reference page and choose another API.
    
        11. The smoke test involves navigating the site and exploring the main features. I've already clicked through the main navigation items and explored some API references. Now, I will click 'CLI Reference' to explore a different section of the documentation.
    
        12. I have already clicked through Docs, Tutorials, Playground, Reference and API Reference. Now I should explore the CLI Reference to fulfill the goal of exploring main features. After clicking on CLI Reference, I will explore further the site, by clicking on 'Error Encyclopedia'
    
        13. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. The history shows I've clicked several links. Now, I will click Error Encyclopedia to explore another area of the documentation.
    
        14. The goal is to smoke test the site. I've clicked through a few API and CLI references, and the Error Encyclopedia. Now I'll click on "Extended Diagnostics" to continue exploring the site.
    
        15. I am on the documentation page for AnimateChildOptions. I have already clicked on the 'Reference' link, the 'API Reference' link and then explored the sub-APIs. Now I should click on another main feature link to keep exploring the main features. I will click on 'Tutorials'.
    
        16. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I've already clicked through several links in the API reference and tutorials. Now, I'll explore the main navigation by clicking the 'Docs' link.
    
        17. The current goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have been clicking through the tutorials and docs links. Now I will click on the 'What is Angular?' link to explore more.
    
        18. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already clicked on several links and buttons. Now I will click on 'Tutorials' to explore the tutorials section.
    
        19. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and verifying key elements. The previous actions involved navigating to different sections. Now I will navigate to the 'Playground' section to explore a different feature.
    
        20. The goal is to perform a smoke test on the Angular Playground, which involves exploring main features and verifying key elements. I am currently on the Playground page, based on the title and URL. I have clicked on some links previously, and now I will click on the Docs link to explore more.
