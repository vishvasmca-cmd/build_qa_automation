📍 On Page: Medium.com Cloudflare Verification
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 1 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I am currently on a Cloudflare verification page. I need to bypass this page to continue the smoke test. Since there's only one link available, I'll click it in hopes of proceeding to the main site.

📍 On Page: Medium.com Security Check
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 1 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The current page is a Cloudflare security check, which is interrupting the autonomous smoke test.

Since there is only one element, I will click that.

📍 On Page: Medium.com Security Check
🤔 State: error
📡 Sending 1 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The current page is a Cloudflare security check page on Medium.com. This indicates that the previous action (clicking 'Meet the team' on Wealthfront's career page, which redirects to Medium) resulted in a security check. Since there are no interactive elements to solve the Cloudflare challenge, I will attempt clicking the Cloudflare link again.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("link", { name: "Cloudflare" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=1 (Cloudflare)

🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://medium.com/work-ing-at-wealthfront
📍 On Page: Medium.com - Cloudflare Check
🤔 State: error
📡 Sending 1 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I am on a Cloudflare security check page. My previous actions have led to this. It's preventing me from reaching the Medium.com domain I was navigating to via the Wealthfront careers page. Since this is an autonomous smoke test, I don't have the capability to solve the CAPTCHA. Therefore, I should navigate back to the Wealthfront homepage to continue exploring from a known good state.

I have already navigated to the landing page, clicked on 'Learn' then 'Pricing', 'Start Investing' and 'Careers', followed by multiple clicks on 'Cloudflare'. Now, I will explore other main navigation links like 'Cash', 'Bonds', 'Automated Investing', 'Stocks', and 'Borrow' to get a feel for the site. I will start with 'Cash'.

📍 On Page: Wealthfront Support - Cloudflare Verification
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 1 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I am currently on a Cloudflare verification page, likely a security measure before accessing the Wealthfront support site. Since I don't have login credentials in `test_data`, I should attempt to bypass this page by returning to the main Wealthfront website and exploring other public areas. The previous action was to click on the 'Learn more' link.

        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. I am on the landing page and the goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I don't have credentials to log in, I will explore the public areas of the site by clicking on the 'Learn more' button.
    
        2. I am on the Wealthfront Cash Account page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on the 'Learn more' button once. Since no login info is available, I will explore other parts of the website. I will click on the Wealthfront logo to return to the homepage.
    
        3. I have already clicked on 'Learn more' and then the 'Wealthfront Logo' to return to the home page. Now I will click the 'Automated Investing' link to explore that feature.
    
        4. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The previous steps involved clicking on 'Learn more' then the 'Wealthfront Logo' and 'Automated Investing'. Now I will click on 'S&P 500 Direct' to explore another feature.
    
        5. I have already navigated to the S&P 500 Direct page. I will now explore the 'How much does this cost?' section to fulfill the 'explore main features' part of the goal.
    
        6. I am on the Wealthfront S&P 500 Direct Indexing page, and I have already clicked on "How much does this cost?". Now, I will navigate back to the home page by clicking on the Wealthfront Logo. This aligns with the goal to navigate the site and explore main features.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore its main features. I've already navigated to a few pages and back to the homepage. Now, I'll navigate to the 'Learn' section to explore the resources available there.
    
        8. I am on the Wealthfront homepage (verified by URL). The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on learn more, the wealthfront logo, automated investing, s&p 500 direct, how much does this cost and learn. Now I will click on Pricing in the navigation bar.
    
        9. I have already navigated to the pricing page. Now I will click the 'Start investing' button to explore that flow.
    
        10. I am currently on the account type/goal selection page, which is part of the sign-up flow. Since the goal is to explore the site and I've already clicked 'Start Investing', I will now explore other publicly accessible links such as those in the footer. I'll start with 'Careers'.
    
        11. I am on the careers page, which is a publicly accessible page. I will explore one of the links on this page. Clicking 'Meet the team' to explore available information.
    
        12. I am currently on a Cloudflare verification page. I need to bypass this page to continue the smoke test. Since there's only one link available, I'll click it in hopes of proceeding to the main site.
    
        13. The current page is a Cloudflare security check, which is interrupting the autonomous smoke test. Clicking the 'Cloudflare' link may redirect to a page where the security check can be bypassed, or at least provide more information about the situation. Since there is only one element, I will click that.
    
        14. The current page is a Cloudflare security check page on Medium.com. This indicates that the previous action (clicking 'Meet the team' on Wealthfront's career page, which redirects to Medium) resulted in a security check. Since there are no interactive elements to solve the Cloudflare challenge, I will attempt clicking the Cloudflare link again.
    
        15. I am on a Cloudflare security check page. My previous actions have led to this. It's preventing me from reaching the Medium.com domain I was navigating to via the Wealthfront careers page. Since this is an autonomous smoke test, I don't have the capability to solve the CAPTCHA. Therefore, I should navigate back to the Wealthfront homepage to continue exploring from a known good state.
    
        16. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I'm currently on the Wealthfront landing page. I have already navigated to the landing page, clicked on 'Learn' then 'Pricing', 'Start Investing' and 'Careers', followed by multiple clicks on 'Cloudflare'. Now, I will explore other main navigation links like 'Cash', 'Bonds', 'Automated Investing', 'Stocks', and 'Borrow' to get a feel for the site. I will start with 'Cash'.
    
        17. The current page is the Wealthfront Cash Account page, which I navigated to in the last step. The goal is to explore the main features. I will click on the 'Learn more' button to further explore the cash account features.
    
        18. I am currently on a Cloudflare verification page, likely a security measure before accessing the Wealthfront support site. Since I don't have login credentials in `test_data`, I should attempt to bypass this page by returning to the main Wealthfront website and exploring other public areas. The previous action was to click on the 'Learn more' link.
    
        19. I have returned to the home page. Now I should click the 'Learn' link to explore the resources available on the website. This aligns with the goal to explore main features.
    
        20. The current page is the homepage of Wealthfront. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. The previous action was clicking on the 'Learn' tab. Now I will explore the 'Pricing' link which is a main feature and verify key elements on that page.
