        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to generally smoke test the site. I will start by clicking the 'Learn' link in the navigation bar to explore the documentation.
    
        2. I have already clicked on the 'Learn' link. Now, I will explore the main features of the page. I will click on the 'Reference' link to navigate to the API reference page.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on 'Learn' and 'Reference'. Now, I should click on 'Community' to continue exploring the main features of the site.
    
        4. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on Learn, Reference, and Community. Now I will click on Blog to continue exploring the main features. After clicking on the Blog button, the page should navigate to the Blog page.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Learn', 'Reference', 'Community' and 'Blog'. Now I will click on the 'Search' button to explore that functionality.
    
        6. I have already navigated to the Blog page and clicked on the search button. Now I need to explore the main features and verify the key elements of the Blog page, which primarily involves scrolling through the articles.
    
        7. I have already clicked through Learn, Reference, Community, and Blog in the header. I have also clicked on the search bar and scrolled down the page. Now I will toggle dark mode to explore the site's features.
    
        8. I've already clicked on the 'Learn', 'Reference', 'Community', and 'Blog' links, as well as the search button and toggled dark mode. I also scrolled down the page. Now I will click on one of the blog posts to explore the page further.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. So far, I've clicked on Learn, Reference, Community, Blog, Search, scrolled, clicked the dark mode button, and clicked on the current blog post. Now, I will go to the home page to explore.
    
        10. I have clicked on the 'Learn', 'Reference', 'Community', 'Blog' buttons. I have also clicked the search, scrolled, and used the dark mode button. Finally, I clicked a link in the blog page and then the React logo to return to the homepage. Now, I will click on 'Open on GitHub' button.
    
        11. I have explored the main navigation links (Learn, Reference, Community, Blog). I clicked on the Search button and a blog post. I clicked on the 'React' logo to return to the home page and clicked on 'Open on GitHub'. Now I will explore the 'Learn React' link to explore more features.
    
        12. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site by exploring its main features and verifying key elements. So far I have clicked on Reference, Community, Blog, Search, Dark mode, Denial of service and source code exposure, react link, Open on Github link and Learn React. I will click on tutorial Tic-Tac-Toe link to explore more.
    
        13. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already navigated to the tutorial page. Now I will explore the 'Adding Interactivity' section within the tutorial.
    
        14. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site, exploring main features, and verifying key elements. I am currently on the 'Adding Interactivity' page within the 'Learn' section. The history shows I have already navigated to the blog, performed a search, used dark mode, navigated to a specific blog post, returned to the homepage, navigated to GitHub, and then to the Learn section, followed by the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial, and lastly, to the 'Adding Interactivity' page. Since this is a smoke test, I'll navigate to the 'Responding to Events' page to explore further.
    
        15. I have already navigated through several sections of the React documentation. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I'm currently on the 'Responding to Events' page. I will now click on the 'State: A Component's Memory' link to continue exploring the documentation.
    
        16. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and verifying key elements. I've already navigated to a specific page ('State: A Component's Memory'). Now I will return to the home page to further explore.
    
        17. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already explored a few links. Now, I will click on the 'Reference' link to explore another main feature.
    
        18. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features. The history shows a sequence of clicks on various 'Learn' pages and return clicks to the homepage and 'Reference' page. Now, I will click on the 'Hooks' link in the Reference section to explore a different feature.
    
        19. I'm on the React Hooks Reference page, as indicated by the title and URL in the history. I have been navigating the site. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I'll click the 'Use Dark Mode' button to check if that feature works.
    
        20. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, navigating the site and exploring its main features. I am currently on the React Hooks Reference page. I previously toggled dark mode. Now I will click on the 'Components' link to navigate to the Components reference page.
