        16. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which includes navigating the site and exploring its main features. I have already navigated to the cart page. From the cart, I will now click the 'Place Order' button to explore the purchase process, and interact with modal elements.
    
        17. I have already clicked on several elements including Home, Sign up, Log in, Close, Contact, About us, Cart, and Place Order. Now that I am on the cart page, I will go back to the homepage to continue exploring the main features of the site.
    
        18. The goal is to navigate the site and explore its main features. The previous actions show that I have already clicked on 'Home', 'Sign up', 'Log in', 'Close', 'Contact', 'About us', 'Cart', 'Place Order', and 'PRODUCT STORE' links/buttons. Now, I will click on the 'Purchase' button to simulate a purchase.
    
        19. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on several links in the header, including 'Home', 'Sign up', 'Log in', 'Contact', 'About us', 'Cart', 'Place Order', 'PRODUCT STORE' and 'Purchase' buttons. I'll go back to the homepage to see if I can find any other features to explore. I will now click on 'Home (current)' to return to the homepage.
    
        20. The current page is the cart page. I have already clicked 'Home (current)' on the cart page, but it did not take me to the homepage, so I will click the 'PRODUCT STORE' button again to get to the homepage and continue exploring other features.
