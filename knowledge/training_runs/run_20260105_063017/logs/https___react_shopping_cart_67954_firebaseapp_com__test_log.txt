        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I am currently on the dashboard page, and a good feature to explore is adding an item to the cart. I will click the first 'Add to cart' button.
    
        2. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. I have already added an item to the cart. Now I will click another 'Add to cart' button to add another item to the cart and explore the main features.
    
        3. I have already added 2 items to the cart. Now I want to click the checkout button to explore that page.
    
        4. The goal is an autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements. The previous steps added 2 items to the cart and navigated to the checkout page. Now that I've added to the cart and gone to checkout, I'll remove an item and go back to the main page.
    
        5. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. So far, I have added two items to the cart, navigated to the checkout page, and then removed one of the items. Now, I will click the plus button to increase the quantity of the remaining item in the cart.
    
        6. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already added a few items to the cart, navigated to the checkout, removed an item and increased the quantity of an item. Now I will click the Linkedin popup to close it.
    
        7. I have already added items to the cart, navigated to checkout, removed items, incremented quantity, and removed from the cart. I need to continue exploring the main features. I will add another item to the cart.
    
        8. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already added some items to the cart, checked out, removed items, and changed the quantity. I will now close the cart by pressing the X button again, and select a size for the product, before adding it to the cart again.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already added and removed items from the cart. Now I will click one more 'add to cart' button to continue exploring the main features of the page.
    
        10. I have added to cart, checked out, removed products, incremented quantity and closed checkout modal. Now, I will add something else to the cart.
    
        11. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already added items to the cart, proceeded to checkout, removed and added items again, and closed the checkout page. Let's add another item to the cart to further explore the main features.

The final steps were to close the cart preview. I am now back on the product listing page. I will add more items to the cart to continue exploring.
    
        13. I have clicked 'Add to cart' multiple times and explored the cart features. Now I should add more items to cart, then check out again. There are many 'Add to cart' buttons, I will pick the first one.
    
        14. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site and explore its main features. I have already added multiple items to the cart. Now I will click the checkout button to see what happens.
