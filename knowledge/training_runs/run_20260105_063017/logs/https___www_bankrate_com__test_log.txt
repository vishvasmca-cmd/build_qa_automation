        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I should start by clicking on one of the main navigation links such as Banking, Mortgages, Investing, etc. I'll start with 'Banking'.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I'm currently on the banking page, so I will now explore the 'CDs' feature by clicking on the 'CDs' button to see CD rates and information.
    
        3. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test which includes exploring main features and verifying key elements. I have already navigated to the 'Banking' page and then clicked on 'CDs'. Now I will navigate to 'High-Yield Savings' to explore another main feature.
    
        4. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the website. The history shows that I have already navigated to Banking -> CDs -> High-Yield Savings. Now I should explore the main features on this page and verify key elements.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already navigated to the high-yield savings accounts page and scrolled. Now I want to click on another main navigation item to further explore the site.
    
        6. The goal is to explore main features. I have navigated to mortgages. Next, I will click on Mortgage rates to explore this feature further.
    
        7. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. The current page is the Bankrate Mortgages dashboard. I have already clicked on 'Mortgage rates' in the previous step. Now I will click on the 'Mortgage calculator' to explore another key feature.
    
        8. I am currently on the mortgage calculator page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I will now input values into the mortgage calculator to test this feature.
    
        9. I'm on the mortgage calculator page and have already filled the 'Home price'. Now I need to explore main features and verify key elements, and the next logical element to fill is 'Down payment'.
    
        10. I am on the mortgage calculator page. I have already filled in the 'Home price' and 'Down payment' fields. Now I will input the Interest rate to proceed to the next step in the autonomous smoke test.
    
        11. I am on the mortgage calculator page and have already filled out the home price, down payment, and interest rate. The next step is to fill in the zip code.
    
        12. I've already navigated to the Mortgage calculator page and filled in the 'Home price', 'Down payment', 'Interest rate', and 'ZIP code' fields. Now, I will click the 'Update' button to trigger the calculation and explore the results.
    
        13. I have already navigated to the mortgage calculator page and filled out the home price, down payment, interest rate, and ZIP code. I also clicked the update button. Now I want to explore other main features, I will explore the 'Taxes, insurance, HOA fees' button.
    
        14. I have already filled in the basic mortgage details (home price, down payment, interest, and zip code) and clicked the update button. Now I have clicked on the 'Taxes, insurance, HOA fees' button. The next step is to fill the 'Property tax per month' field to explore the main features.
    
        15. I am on the Mortgage Calculator page and I have filled the property tax field. Now, I need to fill the Homeowner's insurance per month field to complete the form.
    
        16. I am on the mortgage calculator page and have already filled in some details. I need to input PMI per month to proceed with filling out the form.
    
        17. I have already navigated to the mortgage calculator and filled out some of the fields. I still need to fill out the 'HOA fees per month' field and then click 'Update' again. Then, I will explore other main features, and verify key elements. Since there is no explicit step for verification, I will assume that after 'Update' I should explore the other main features.
    
        18. I'm on the Bankrate Mortgage Calculator page and have already filled in the initial details and the 'Taxes, insurance, HOA fees'. Now, I need to update the values and then explore other main features of the site.
    
        19. The goal is to do a smoke test of the website. I have already filled in some values in the mortgage calculator. Now I will click the 'banking' link to navigate to a different section of the website.
    
        20. The goal is to smoke test the site. The previous step successfully navigated to the banking page. Now I will explore main features by clicking the 'Checking & savings' button.
