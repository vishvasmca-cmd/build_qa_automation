        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since this is the first action, I will start by clicking the 'Get Started' link to explore the documentation.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The last action was clicking 'GET STARTED' which took us to the intro page. Now, I will explore the 'Docs' link in the header.
    
        3. The goal is to explore main features. The current page is the installation documentation. The history shows that I've already clicked on "Get Started" and "Docs", so clicking on other main navigation links such as "API", "Node.js", or "Community" would be the next logical step.
    
        4. I'm currently on the Playwright Library API Reference page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to Docs and API. Now I will explore the classes.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. The history shows that I've clicked on 'GET STARTED', 'Docs', 'API', and 'Classes'. Now I will click on a class to explore further.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked 'GET STARTED', 'Docs', 'API', 'Classes', and 'APIRequest'. Now I will go back to the 'API' page and click on 'Assertions'.
    
        7. I am on the API documentation page for Playwright. I have previously navigated to the Docs, then API, Classes, APIRequest, and Assertions. The goal is to generally explore the site. I will now click on the 'Playwright Test' link to explore that section of the documentation.
    
        8. The current goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which involves navigating the site and verifying key elements. The history shows that I have already navigated to the API documentation for Playwright Test. Now I can explore another main feature of the site which could be 'Community'.
    
        9. I have successfully navigated to the community welcome page. The next step in the smoke test is to explore the main features. I'll click on the "Docs" link to explore the documentation features.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to several pages. I will now navigate to the home page.
    
        11. I have navigated to several pages already. The goal is to navigate the site and explore key features. I will now try clicking on the GitHub link in the header to explore the GitHub repository, which is another main feature.
    
        12. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, navigating the site and exploring main features. The previous steps have navigated to different sections of the website. Now I should click the Get Started button on the landing page to see if the navigation works and the button is operational.
    
        13. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. The history shows that I have already navigated to several pages including API, Community, Docs, and the homepage. Now I will explore 'Guides' section.
    
        14. The goal is to navigate the site, explore the main features and verify key elements. The previous actions have explored the API, Community, Docs, Github and Guides pages. Now, I will click the Playwright link to return to the homepage.
    
        15. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features and verify key elements. I have already explored several links, like API, Assertions, Community, Docs, GitHub. The next logical step is to click on one of the remaining links on the page. 'Learn Videos' seems like a good option to explore.
    
        16. I have already navigated to the Learn Videos page. Now I should click on one of the videos to make sure the video player works. There are many videos on the page; I'll choose the first one.
    
        17. I am on the Playwright Learn Videos page, and I have already clicked on the first video. Now, I will click on the second video on the page to explore more features. The goal is to smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features.
    
        18. I am on the Playwright Learn Videos page. I have already clicked on a few videos. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I will now click on the 'Feature Videos' link to navigate to that section and explore those videos.
    
        19. The goal is to perform a smoke test of the site, which includes navigating the site and exploring main features. I've already navigated to the Feature Videos page. Now I will click one of the videos, to explore further.
    
        20. I am currently on the Feature Videos page and have already clicked on the first video thumbnail. The next step is to explore more main features by navigating to another video.
