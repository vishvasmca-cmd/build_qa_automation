        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to perform a smoke test, and the current page is the Google Search homepage. Since there are no credentials available, I will avoid signing in. I will start by exploring the 'About' link at the top of the page.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate and explore main features. I previously clicked the 'About' link. Now I will click the 'Store' link, as this is a major feature to explore on the Google landing page and I have not navigated to it yet.
    
        3. The user wants to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked 'About' and 'Store'. Since I'm on the Google About Page and the previous actions were successful, I will continue exploring the available links on the page. The page context mentions links like 'Products', 'Company Info', and 'News'. I'll click on 'Products' to explore Google's product offerings.
    
        4. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring its main features. I have already navigated to the Google About page and tried clicking 'Store' which failed. Now I will explore the available products by clicking the 'Products' link.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'About', 'Store' (unsuccessfully), and 'Products'. Now I will explore the 'Company Info' link.
    
        6. I have already navigated to the 'Company Info' page. Now I will explore the products page to continue exploring the site and its main features.
    
        7. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. I have clicked on About, Store (failed), Products, and Company Info. The next logical step is to click on News.
    
        8. I have navigated to the Products page a few times. Now I'll click the google account button
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. The history shows I have clicked through several navigation links: About, Products, Company Info, Products, News and Google Account. I will explore the 'Products' link again to see if it leads to a different page or section with more features.
    
        10. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features. The history shows several clicks already performed on the site including 'About', 'Store', 'Products', 'Company Info', 'News', and 'Google Account'. I will now click the 'Accessibility support' button to explore another main feature of the site.
    
        11. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features and verify key elements. I have already clicked 'About', 'Store', 'Products', 'Company Info', 'News', 'Google Account', and 'Accessibility support'. The current page is 'Google Products'. I will click on the Google Store button next to continue exploring.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Based on the history, I have already clicked on several links on the page: 'Store', 'Products', 'Company Info', 'News', 'Google Account', 'Accessibility support', and 'Google Store'. I will now click on 'About' to continue exploring the main features.
    
        13. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Products', 'Company Info', 'News', 'Google Account', 'Accessibility support', 'Google Store' and 'About'. Now I will try clicking on 'Careers'.
    
        14. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked on several links. I will click on the 'Products' link to explore Google products.
    
        15. I'm on the Google Products page, and the goal is to explore the main features. I have clicked on several links like 'Company Info', 'Products', 'News', 'Google Account', 'Accessibility support', 'Google Store', 'About', 'Careers link opens in new tab or window', 'Products'. It seems I'm repeatedly clicking on the same few elements. To diversify exploration, I will click the 'Jump to our products' button to navigate to a different part of the page.
    
        16. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on several elements. Now I should explore other main features. Let's try clicking the 'Download the Google app' link.
    
        17. I have already navigated to the Google Products page and clicked on several links. Now I will click on 'How Search Works' to explore another feature.
    
        18. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring the main features. The previous actions show that I have clicked on several links on the page already. Now I will click on company info to explore.
    
        19. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. The history shows several clicks on different links. The current page is the 'About Google - Company Information' page. To continue exploring, I will click the 'News' link to see Google's news updates.
    
        20. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, exploring main features and verifying key elements. The current page is the Google Company Info page. I have already clicked on 'News'. I will now click on 'Careers', 'Locations', and 'Contact Us' to explore the links on the current page.
