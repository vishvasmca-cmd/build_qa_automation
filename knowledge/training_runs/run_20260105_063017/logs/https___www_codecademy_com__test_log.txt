        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. I am on the login screen, and I don't have credentials. Instead of logging in, I'll explore the site. I'll start by clicking on the 'Catalog' button to explore available courses.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The last action was clicking the 'Catalog' button. Now I will click the 'Course topics' button to explore another main feature.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on 'Catalog' and then on 'Course topics'. Next, I'll click 'Live learning' to further explore the catalog.
    
        4. I am on the Codecademy homepage. The autonomous smoke test goal requires me to explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Catalog,' 'Course Topics,' and 'Live Learning.' Now I will click on 'Skill paths'.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'Catalog', 'Course topics', 'Live learning', and 'Skill paths'. The next logical step is to click on 'Career paths'.
    
        6. I am on the Codecademy homepage. The goal is to navigate and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'Catalog', 'Course topics', 'Live learning', 'Skill paths', and 'Career paths'. Next, I will click the 'Certification paths' button to continue exploring the main features.
    
        7. I am on the Codecademy homepage, which is a login screen. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring key features. I have already clicked on: Catalog, Course topics, Live learning, Skill paths, Career paths, and Certification paths. Now, I will click on the 'Resources' button to explore more site features.
    
        8. I have navigated through 'Catalog' and its sub-elements like 'Course topics', 'Live learning', 'Skill paths', 'Career paths', 'Certification paths', and 'Resources'. Now, I should explore main features by clicking on each language in the modal: 'Python', 'JavaScript', 'HTML & CSS', 'C#', 'C++', and 'C'. Starting with Python.
    
        9. I have already navigated the catalog, resources, and Python. The next step is to explore the main features and verify key elements. There are other language options in the page context, such as HTML, C++, Java, React, CSS, and Javascript. I am selecting 'HTML' to explore.
    
        10. I'm on the C++ documentation page. The goal is to explore the site. I've previously clicked 'Resources' then 'Python' and then HTML. Now I should click on 'C++' since I'm on the C++ documentation page.
    
        11. I am on the Codecademy Resources: C++ Documentation page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I will click on the 'Topics' button to explore further features.
    
        12. I am on the PHP documentation page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'Topics' button. Now I need to further explore the topics listed. I will click on 'AI' to explore this topic.
    
        13. I am on the PHP Documentation page, and the goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already clicked on several links, including Resources, Python, HTML, PHP and Topics. Now I will click on Pricing.
    
        14. The goal is to do a smoke test. I have already navigated to the PHP documentation page and clicked on Topics, AI, and Pricing. Now I will click on the Catalog button to explore the site's catalog of courses.
    
        15. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked a number of elements. Now, I will click on 'Join Pro' button to explore a main feature. I can also explore Catalog button with id 13 again.
    
        16. I am on the PHP documentation page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on several buttons. Let's try clicking on a featured learning item to explore further.
    
        17. The current page is the Codecademy login screen. Since `test_data` has no credentials, I should explore publicly available areas instead. I will navigate to the homepage to continue exploring the site's features.
    
        18. The current page is the login screen. Since the smoke test goal is to navigate the site and explore main features, and no credentials are provided, I should avoid logging in. Instead, I'll explore the available links at the bottom of the page, such as the 'More ways to sign up' link, to see publicly available content.
    
        19. I am currently on the registration page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since there are no credentials provided, I will skip the registration process and attempt to explore publicly accessible areas of the site instead. I'll navigate back to the home page to explore the main features.
    
        20. The page is at the login screen. The goal is to explore the main features. Since there are no credentials available, I will skip the login and explore publicly available areas of the website such as the 'Top subjects' links.
