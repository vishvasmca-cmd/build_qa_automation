        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. I am on the Flipkart home page. The goal is to navigate and explore main features. Since there is no login information, I will skip login and explore public features like searching. I will start by clicking the search bar to explore the search functionality.
    
        2. I am on the Flipkart home page, and the goal is to explore the main features. I have already clicked the search bar. Now, I will input a search query to explore a product listing.
    
        3. I've already clicked on the search bar and entered search query, I should now click on search to execute it. The search icon with text 'Search for Products, Brands and More' seems like the right option.
    
        4. I am on the search results page for 'headphones' on Flipkart. My goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features. Since the elements array is empty, I cannot interact with any specific element on the page. I will assume the previous steps of searching for 'headphones' were successful. To continue exploring the site, I will navigate back to the homepage using the back button, as I cannot locate a Flipkart logo to click to return to the home page.
    
        5. I have already searched for 'headphones' and navigated back to the home page. Now, I will attempt to explore one of the main categories available on the page. There are many options, such as 'Mobiles & Tablets', 'Fashion', 'Electronics', etc. I'll start with 'Mobiles & Tablets'.
    
        6. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the website by navigating the site, exploring the main features, and verifying key elements. I previously clicked on the 'Mobiles & Tablets' section. Now I will click on the 'Fashion' section to continue exploring main features.
    
        7. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the website by navigating and exploring main features. I have already navigated to the website, clicked on Mobiles & Tablets and Fashion categories. Now I will click on Electronics to continue exploring the website's main features.
    
        8. I have already navigated to the home page and clicked on Mobiles & Tablets, Fashion and Electronics. The next step is to explore the TVs & Appliances section to fulfill the goal of exploring the main features.
    
        9. I have already explored Mobiles & Tablets, Fashion, Electronics and TVs & Appliances categories. Now I will explore the Home & Furniture Category.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on several main navigation links, as per the history. The next obvious main feature to explore would be 'Flight Bookings'.
    
        11. I have already clicked several main navigation links. Now I will click on 'Grocery'. This is part of exploring the main features of the site as per the goal.
    
        12. I have clicked on the grocery button. Now the page is loading. I should wait for the loading to complete and elements to become available for interaction.
    
        13. I am on the Grocery/Supermart page, which is also a login screen. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. Because I don't have any test credentials, I will skip login and instead explore publicly accessible links such as Contact Us or About Us in the page's footer. Scrolling the page first to ensure that all such elements are visible. Scrolling has already been done, so I can proceed directly with clicking on 'Contact Us'.
    
        14. I have already navigated to the Grocery Supermart store and clicked on the Contact Us link. Now, I will explore another main feature by clicking the 'About Us' link in the footer, which is element 88.
    
        15. I've already navigated to the Flipkart grocery store and clicked on 'Contact Us' and 'About Us'. The goal is to 'explore main features and verify key elements.' I will now explore some of the grocery categories.
    
        16. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which involves navigating the site and exploring the main features. The last action was clicking on 'pulses'. Now, I will click on another grocery category to continue exploring the site. I will click on 'sooji'.
    
        17. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and exploring its main features. The current page requires a delivery location to be set, and it appears to be blocking other interactions. Therefore, I need to click on the element that allows me to set the delivery location.
    
        18. The goal is to navigate the site and explore its main features. I am currently on the Flipkart Grocery Supermart page, and the previous action was clicking the "Location not set" button. Since I don't have location data, I will just continue exploring by clicking on more items in the categories list.
    
        19. I am on the Flipkart Grocery Supermart page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on several elements like 'Home & Furniture', 'Flight Bookings', 'Grocery', 'Contact Us', 'About Us', 'pulses', 'sooji', 'Location not set Select delivery location', and 'maida'. There is a popup for location selection. I will click 'Search grocery products in Supermart' to continue exploring.
    
        20. The page is currently displaying login screen. Since no credentials are provided in the test data, I will skip login and explore the site by clicking on one of the elements.
