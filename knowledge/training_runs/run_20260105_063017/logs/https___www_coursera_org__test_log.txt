        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate and explore the site. I am on the homepage. I should explore by clicking the 'Explore our catalog' button to see available courses.
    
        2. I've already clicked 'Explore our catalog'. Now I should continue exploring the main features, so I will click 'Degrees'.
    
        3. I have already navigated to the degrees page. Now I need to explore the main features and verify key elements. Clicking on a degree program will allow further exploration. I will click on the first degree listed, 'Master of Computer Science in Data Science'.
    
        4. I have already clicked the 'Explore our catalog' button on the homepage, then I clicked the 'Degrees' button to navigate to the degree page, and then I clicked on 'Go to degree, Master of Computer Science in Data Science'. Now I need to navigate back to the degrees page to continue exploring the other degrees. I will click the back button.
    
        5. I am on the Coursera Degrees page. I have already navigated to the Degrees page and clicked on a degree, then went back to the degrees page. Now I want to explore other main features by clicking the 'Program Level' filter button.
    
        6. The current page is the Coursera Degrees Page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked 'Explore our catalog', then 'Degrees', then clicked on a specific degree, then went back to the degrees page, then clicked on program level filter button. Now I need to select a program level. Since the program level filter options are not listed as elements, I need to click on the filter button again to show options. Then explore the program level filter options.
    
        7. The goal is to perform a smoke test, involving navigation and feature exploration. I have clicked on 'Explore our catalog', then 'Degrees', then a specific degree, then 'Go to previous page', then clicked the Program Level filter twice. I should click on 'Go to page 2' to continue exploration.
    
        8. I am on the degrees page and I have clicked on the second page number. Now I want to explore the main features by clicking on one of the degree links.
    
        9. I have navigated to a degree page, and now I need to go back to the degrees page. Then I should navigate to the next page of the degrees listing. After that I will return to the degrees list and explore another degree page.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features and verify key elements. I've already clicked through several pages of degrees and individual degree options. Let's click on the next page button to continue exploring the degree options.
    
        11. I have already clicked 'Explore our catalog', 'Degrees', navigated to degree pages and back, and also clicked on 'Program Level Filter' button. Now I will navigate to the next page to continue exploring degrees.
    
        12. I have already navigated to the degrees page, clicked on a degree, gone back, applied program level filter and navigated a few pages back and forth. I will now click on Master of Engineering in Engineering Management to explore a new degree.
    
        13. I'm on the degree listing page. I've navigated back and forth between a degree page and the listing. I have also navigated to next pages. I should now explore the filters to the left of the degree listing. The next filter I will explore is the subject filter. Since I have explored the program level filter, I should explore the subject filter.
    
        14. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on a degree and then gone back to the degrees page. Now I should click on a different filter, 'Subject'.
    
        15. I'm on the degrees page and have clicked on the subject filter button twice already. Now I want to explore other parts of the page. I will click the first degree on the list.
    
        16. I am on the degrees page, and have clicked a few degrees. The goal is to navigate and explore the site. I will now click on the explore catalog button to see what happens.
    
        17. The previous action led to the catalog page. Now I will explore the catalog by clicking on the 'Artificial Intelligence' category to navigate to a subpage.
    
        18. I have explored the degree page and clicked on a few degrees. I also clicked on the Explore our catalog button and then Artificial Intelligence. Now I will navigate to the home page to continue exploration.
    
        19. I am on the Coursera landing page. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements for smoke testing. I will now explore the catalog.
    
        20. The current page is the Coursera homepage, and the goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I previously clicked 'Explore our catalog'. Now, I will click the 'Degrees' link to explore the degrees section of the website.
