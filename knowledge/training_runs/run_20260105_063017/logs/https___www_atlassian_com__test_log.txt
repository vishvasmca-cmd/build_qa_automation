        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I will start by clicking the 'Products' link in the navigation bar to explore the product offerings.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The previous action was clicking on 'Products'. Since the page context indicates a login screen and I have no credentials, I will skip any login attempts and instead attempt to navigate to other main features by selecting the 'Close' button on the login screen to dismiss the modal and explore the public content.
    
        3. The current goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which includes navigating the site and exploring main features. I have already clicked on 'Products' and 'Close' on a modal or popup. Now I will click on the Atlassian logo to navigate back to the homepage to further explore the site from a known location.
    
        4. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked on Products, closed a modal, and returned to the homepage by clicking the logo. Now, I will explore the Solutions section to further explore the site's features.
    
        5. I have already explored Products, Closed the popup, clicked the logo and explored Solutions. Now I will click on 'Why Atlassian?' to continue exploring the site.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on Products, the Atlassian Logo, Solutions and Why Atlassian?. Next, I will click on Resources.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked through Products, closed a modal, returned to the homepage, and then clicked on Solutions, Why Atlassian?, and Resources. Now I will click on 'Customers' to continue exploring main navigation items.
    
        8. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I have already clicked on the main navigation items and a link inside of the Resources menu. I will now click on the Atlassian logo to go back to the homepage, then click on the Sign in button to see the login page.
    
        9. I have already explored the main navigation links (Products, Solutions, Why Atlassian?, Resources, Customers). I will now click on the 'Enterprise' link to further explore the website. Then I will click the logo to return to the homepage.
    
        10. I have explored several main navigation links on the Atlassian website and then navigated to the Enterprise page. Since I am on the Enterprise page, I will click the 'Overview' link to further explore the features of this page.
    
        11. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The current page is the Atlassian Enterprise page. I have already clicked on several elements on the homepage, navigated to the Enterprise page. The last action failed, because the target element was not found on the page. Now I will click on the 'Overview' button to navigate to the overview page of enterprise.
    
        12. I am on the Atlassian Enterprise page. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features. I've already clicked on the 'Overview' link. Now I will click the 'Success' link to continue exploring the page. Since there are no elements available, I will assume that the link to Success is not included in the 'elements' list. Instead, I will skip this action and move to the next best action to move towards the goal.
    
        13. The current goal is to smoke test the Atlassian website. The navigation to main pages such as Products, Solutions, Why Atlassian, Resources, Enterprise, and Customers has been completed. I will now explore the Products menu to check the landing of the products page.
    
        14. The goal is to explore the main features. I have already navigated to the homepage and clicked on the 'Products' menu. Now I should click on one of the products listed on the homepage, such as Jira, to further explore the site's features.
    
        15. The current page is a promotional landing page, and the goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I previously clicked on 'Products' then 'Jira'. I will now navigate back to the homepage to continue exploring other main features. I will click on the Atlassian logo to navigate back to the homepage.
    
        16. The current page appears to be the Atlassian homepage after navigating back from the Jira page. I need to continue exploring the main features of the site, so I will click on the 'Solutions' button.
    
        17. The goal is to explore the main features. The last action was clicking the 'Solutions' button. Now I will click on the 'Why Atlassian?' link to explore more of the site's features.
    
        18. The page is the Atlassian homepage, and it's showing a login screen. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since there are no credentials provided, I will close the login screen to explore the publically available site features.
    
        19. I have already explored 'Enterprise', 'Products', 'Jira', 'Solutions', and 'Why Atlassian?'. Now I should explore 'Resources'.
    
        20. I have already clicked through several top-level nav elements ('Products', 'Solutions', 'Why Atlassian?', 'Resources') and clicked the 'Close' button. I will now click 'Sign in' button in the top navigation bar to explore this feature.
