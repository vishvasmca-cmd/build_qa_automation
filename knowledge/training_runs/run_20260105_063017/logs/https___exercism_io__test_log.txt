        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. Since I don't have login credentials, I will skip the login and signup options for now. I'll click on 'Explore languages' to navigate to the languages page, which is a main feature.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The page is the login screen at /tracks. I have already clicked on "Explore languages" which brought me here. Since there are no credentials, I will skip logging in or signing up and will explore the publicly accessible links instead. I'll click on the Exercism link in the header, to navigate to the homepage.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already clicked 'Explore languages' and 'Exercism' buttons. Now I need to choose another main feature to explore, I will click on Learn to see what the page looks like.
    
        4. I am on the login screen, but there are no login credentials available. As per the persona guidelines, I should explore publicly accessible areas instead of attempting to log in. I will navigate to the pricing page to explore a publicly accessible area.
    
        5. The current page is a 404 error. I previously navigated to the pricing page, but it resulted in an error. I'll try navigating to the homepage again by clicking the 'Exercism' link in the top left.
    
        6. The goal is to do an autonomous smoke test, which involves navigating the site and verifying key elements. I have already navigated to the pricing page. Now I will click on the 'Explore languages' button to navigate to the tracks page and explore available languages to fulfill the goal to explore main features.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already explored languages, clicked on Exercism logo to go to Homepage, clicked on Learn link, and navigated to the pricing page. Now I will go back to the Homepage and click the "Sign up for free" button. This should navigate to the sign up page and allow to explore the sign up feature. I will click the "Sign up for free" button with id 9.
    
        8. The current page is the language tracks page. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site by navigating it, exploring its main features, and verifying key elements. I have already clicked on the 'Sign up for free' button. Because there are no credentials, I should not sign up. I will go to the homepage by clicking on the Exercism link, then click the 'Learn' link.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already clicked on Explore Languages, Exercism button, and Sign up for free. Now I'll click on the 'Learn' link in the footer to explore that area.
    
        10. I have already navigated to the homepage, explored languages, and tried to sign up. Now I will explore the footer links starting with 'About Exercism'.
    
        11. I am on the login screen. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I don't have login credentials. I will click the "Exercism" link to navigate to the homepage and continue exploration from there.
    
        12. The current goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I'm currently on the landing page. I've already explored several main features by navigating to different URLs. Now I'll click on another main feature link to explore.
    
        13. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test of the website. I have navigated to several pages already. Currently, the page is at the /tracks page. Since no login information is available, I will not attempt to log in. Instead, I will navigate to the 'Contribute' page to explore other features.
    
        14. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I am currently on the 'Exercism Tracks' page, and I have already navigated to the pricing page, home page and clicked on 'Explore languages' and 'Contribute'. I will now click on a language track to explore the exercises available for that track. I'll choose 'Python' as a popular language.
    
        15. The goal is to do an autonomous smoke test. The history shows that I have already explored multiple pages. The current page is 'Exercism - Contributing', which is relevant to the goal. From here, I will click on the 'Learn' link in the header to navigate to a different part of the site to ensure basic navigation and element verification keeps occurring.
    
        16. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site by navigating and exploring key features. The history shows that I've navigated to the contributing page. I will click the 'Learn' link again to see where it navigates, as it seems to redirect back to the language tracks page.
    
        17. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The current page is the Exercism Tracks page and I see 'Sign up' and 'Log in' buttons, meaning I'm at the logged-out home page. I will click on the 'Language Tracks' link to further explore the site's features.
    
        18. I am on the Exercism Tracks page. The goal is to navigate and explore the site. I have clicked through several links already. I will click on one of the listed languages to explore that page.
    
        19. The current page is the Exercism Tracks page, where I can browse and select language tracks. I want to navigate the site and explore the main features. I will click on the 'Discover' button to explore other parts of the website.
    
        20. I have landed on the Java track page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features and verify key elements. I will click on 'Explore concepts' to navigate to the concepts page.
