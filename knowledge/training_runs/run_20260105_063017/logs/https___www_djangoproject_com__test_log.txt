🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/faq/
📍 On Page: Django FAQ
🤔 State: dashboard
📡 Sending 160 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I am currently on the Django FAQ page, which is the last step in the browsing history. Since the overall goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements, I will click on one of the main navigation links at the top of the page (e.g., OVERVIEW) to continue exploring the site.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("link", { name: "OVERVIEW" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=3 (OVERVIEW)

--- Step 7 ---
🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.djangoproject.com/community/
📍 On Page: Django Community
🤔 State: dashboard
📡 Sending 188 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I have already clicked on DOCUMENTATION, Tutorials, FAQ, OVERVIEW, DOWNLOAD, and COMMUNITY. I will now click on NEWS to explore another main feature of the site.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("link", { name: "NEWS" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=6 (NEWS)
💾 Trace saved to projects/https___www_djangoproject_com__regression/outputs/trace.json

📍 On Page: Django Software Foundation
🤔 State: dashboard
📡 Sending 114 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I have already clicked on DOCUMENTATION, Tutorials, FAQ, OVERVIEW, DOWNLOAD, COMMUNITY, NEWS, and FOUNDATION links. There aren't more obvious top-level links to click. Let's click the Django link to return to the homepage.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("link", { name: "Django" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=2 (Django)
💾 Trace saved to projects/https___www_djangoproject_com__regression/outputs/trace.json
💾 Passive Collection: 114 elements saved.

--- Step 10 ---
🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.djangoproject.com/
📍 On Page: Django - The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 86 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I have already explored the main features and the key elements. Now I need to verify the key elements, specifically the 'Django' link on the top left to ensure it redirects to the homepage, which I have done in step 8. I have already clicked most of the links on the navigation, including the 'Django' home link. So, I will click on the Django documentation again to verify.
