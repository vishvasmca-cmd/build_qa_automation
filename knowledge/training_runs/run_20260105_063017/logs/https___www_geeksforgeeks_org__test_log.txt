        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. I am on the login screen of GeeksforGeeks. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since no credentials are provided, I will skip the login and instead explore public areas. I see links to different categories like 'Tutorials' and 'Interview Prep'. I will start by clicking on 'Tutorials'.
    
        2. The goal is to explore the main features of the site. I have already clicked on 'Tutorials'. Now I will explore 'Interview Prep'.
    
        3. I have clicked on 'Tutorials' and 'Interview Prep' in the past. Now I will click on 'Tracks' to further explore the main features of the website.
    
        4. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The previous actions were to click Tutorials, Interview Prep and Tracks. Now I will explore another main feature. I will click on the DSA link.
    
        5. I have clicked Tutorials, Interview Prep, Tracks, and DSA. The current page is the DSA tutorial page. Since the goal is to navigate the site and explore main features, I should continue clicking on available options in the navbar.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. So far, I've clicked on 'Tutorials', 'Interview Prep', 'Tracks' and 'DSA'. I will now explore the 'Interview Questions' link.
    
        7. I am currently on the 'Top 100 Data Structure and Algorithms DSA Interview Questions Topic-wise - GeeksforGeeks' page. I have previously clicked on Tutorials, Interview Prep, Tracks, DSA, and Interview Questions. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I will click on 'Must Do' to explore another feature.
    
        8. I have navigated through Tutorials, Interview Prep, Tracks, DSA Tutorial, Interview Questions, and finally landed on the 'Must Do Coding Interview Questions' page. Now I will explore the search bar to search for a specific question.
    
        9. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the website, which involves navigating the site and exploring its main features. I have already clicked on 'Tutorials', 'Interview Prep', 'Tracks', 'DSA', 'Interview Questions', 'Must Do' and searched. Now I will scroll down to explore main features.
    
        10. I have navigated to the 'Must Do' page and entered a value to the search bar, then scrolled to the bottom. I will click on one of the tutorial topics to continue exploring the site.
    
        11. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows that I have already clicked on Tutorials, Interview Prep, Tracks, DSA, Interview Questions, Must Do, used the search bar, scrolled, and clicked on 'Arrays'. The next logical step is to click on another topic under 'Must Do' section to further explore the site. Let's click on 'String' to explore string related interview questions.
    
        12. I've already navigated to several pages and interacted with a search bar. Now I'm on a page with a list of coding questions. I will scroll to see more elements to fulfill the 'explore main features' part of the goal.
    
        13. I have already navigated the site, explored the main features by clicking on 'Tracks', 'DSA', 'Interview Questions', 'Must Do', filled the search bar, scrolled, clicked on 'Arrays' and 'String'. I will now scroll again to further explore the page and find more key elements. Since the goal is 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements' and no explicit element verification step is defined, I'll assume exploring the page means scrolling it.
    
        14. I have already navigated the site, explored the 'DSA', 'Interview Questions', 'Must Do' sections, searched, and explored 'Arrays' and 'String' categories. I have also scrolled multiple times. Now I will explore some of the other categories. Let's go with 'Searching'.
    
        15. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. The history shows that I have already navigated to the 'Must Do' page, filled the search bar, scrolled down, and clicked on 'Arrays', 'String', and 'Searching'. I should continue exploring the topics listed on this page to verify key elements.
    
        16. The goal is to smoke test the website. I have already navigated to the 'Must Do' section and clicked on the 'Arrays', 'String', 'Searching', and 'Sorting' categories. Now I will continue exploring the categories by clicking 'Two Pointer'.
    
        17. I've already explored several categories of coding questions. Now, I'll scroll down the page to explore more.
    
        18. The goal is to explore the main features of the site. I have already interacted with several elements. Now, let's explore another feature, 'Window Sliding'
    
        19. I have already clicked on Arrays, String, Searching, Sorting, Two Pointer, and Window Sliding. Now I will click on Hashing to further explore the main features of the site.
    
        20. I have already clicked on several categories including Arrays, String, Searching, Sorting, Two Pointer, Window Sliding, and Hashing. To further explore the site's main features, I will now click on the 'Recursion' category.
