        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since I am on the landing page, I will start by exploring the 'Learn' section to see if I can get more information about the platform.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on the 'Learn' link. Now I will click on the 'Invest' link to continue exploring the main features of the site.
    
        3. I am currently on the Robinhood homepage, which appears to be in a login state. My goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements, without logging in. I will try navigating to the 'Learn' section of the website as it's a publicly accessible resource. I have already visited the Learn and Invest pages, so I will now attempt to visit the Trading page to further explore the site's features.
    
        4. I am on the Robinhood homepage, which is a login screen. I have already clicked on the Learn, Invest and Trading links. I will now click on Crypto to further explore the site's main features.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. The history shows that I have clicked on Learn, Invest, Trading, and Crypto links. Now I will click on Retirement.
    
        6. I have explored the main navigation. I will now click on Banking to explore that page. It is part of my autonomous smoke test to navigate and explore main features.
    
        7. I have already clicked through the main navigation items: Learn, Invest, Trading, Crypto, Retirement, Banking. Now I will click Credit Card link to explore a different feature.
    
        8. I am on the login screen. The goal is to smoke test the website. I have already clicked on the Invest, Trading, Crypto, Retirement, Banking and Credit Card links on the home page. Since I am on the login screen and there are no credentials, I should not try to log in. Instead, I should look for other public links on the page. The 'Learn' link in the footer seems like a good option. I have identified the 'Learn' link with id 70. I will click this link to explore the 'Learn' section of the website.
    
        9. I have already clicked through many of the top level naviation items. Now I will start to select the footer links. I'll start with 'Fee Schedule'
    
        10. I have already explored main navigation features. Now I will scroll down and select a footer link.
    
        11. I have explored main features like Invest, Trading, Crypto, Retirement, Banking, Credit Card, Learn, Fee Schedule, and Support. I've reached a login screen. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features, so I will now click on About us to continue exploring.
    
        12. I have already clicked through a series of navigation links and footer links based on prior steps. Now that I am on the login screen, I should continue exploring publicly accessible links in the footer. I will click on the 'Terms & Conditions' link in the footer.
    
        13. I have already clicked on several links on the home page: 'Trading', 'Crypto', 'Retirement', 'Banking', 'Credit Card', 'Learn', 'Fee Schedule', 'Support', 'About us', and 'Terms & Conditions'. Now, I will click on 'Disclosures' to further explore the site as part of the autonomous smoke test.
    
        14. I have clicked on a variety of links from the homepage footer. The current page is the login screen. The goal is to perform a smoke test and explore main features. I will now click on 'Learn more' to explore public parts of the website. There are multiple 'Learn more' links, starting with id 3.
    
        15. I have already explored many elements on the page. Now I will click on the "Sign up" button to see where it leads.
    
        16. I have navigated to the Robinhood trading page and clicked on the 'Sign up' button. Since the goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. Given the nature of smoke tests, I will navigate back to the homepage to further explore by clicking on the logo.
    
        17. I've landed back on the homepage after navigating to different pages, as part of the autonomous smoke test to navigate the site and explore the main features. I should now explore some more links in the main navigation, like Invest. This will continue exploring the site's features.
    
        18. I am on the Robinhood homepage and the goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on Learn, Fee Schedule, Support, About us, Terms & Conditions, Disclosures, Learn more, Sign up and Invest. Now, let's explore the 'Predict' section.
    
        19. I have already clicked on 'Invest' and 'Predict' buttons. Now I will click on 'Strategies' to explore another main feature, as instructed by the goal.
    
        20. I am on the Robinhood login screen. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. Since I am on the login screen and I don't have credentials, I should explore publicly accessible areas of the website. I will click on the 'Learn' link in the navigation bar, as this is a main feature.
