        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which includes navigating the site and exploring main features. Since there is no login information, I will start by exploring the main navigation and click on the 'Product' button to explore the product features.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The previous action was clicking on the "Product" button, which likely opened a dropdown menu. Now, I should select an item from the dropdown menu to explore a specific feature. "Product overview" sounds like a good starting point.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already navigated to the 'Product Overview' page. Now I will click on the 'Solutions' button.
    
        4. The goal is to perform a smoke test, which involves navigating the site and exploring main features. I've already clicked on Product and Solutions. I should now click Learning & support to continue exploring the main navigation. This will expose more site features.
    
        5. I have already clicked on Product, Product overview, Solution and Learning & support. Now, let's click on Pricing to explore more features.
    
        6. I have already navigated to the pricing page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since I am already on the pricing page, I will click on a button to navigate to a different page to explore other features. I will choose the Asana Home button.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already clicked 'Product', 'Product overview', 'Solutions', 'Learning & support', 'Pricing', and 'Asana Home'. Now, I will check Pricing page to find main features. On the home page, there's a 'Pricing' link, which I've already clicked in a previous step. Since the current page context indicates a login screen, and I have no login credentials, I will explore publicly accessible areas. I will explore the 'Product' button again, followed by 'Product overview'.
    
        8. I have already clicked on several elements on the page: 'Product', 'Product overview', 'Solutions', 'Learning & support', 'Pricing', 'Asana Home', and 'Product' again. Now I will explore the 'Product overview' link under the 'Product' menu to further explore the main features of the site.
    
        9. I have already navigated to the product page twice, clicked on solutions, learning and support, pricing and home page. Now I will click on the "All features" link under the product menu to explore more features. This aligns with the goal of exploring the main features.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I'm currently on the 'Asana Features' page, and I've navigated to it previously. I should now explore the elements on this page to fulfill the goal. I will scroll down to view more content on the page.
