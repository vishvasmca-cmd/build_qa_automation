        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which includes navigating the site and exploring main features. I am currently on the landing page, which appears to be a login screen. Since I don't have any login credentials, I will skip the login process and explore publicly accessible areas. I'll start by clicking on the 'Kata Library' link to explore the challenges.
    
        2. The goal is to smoke test the site. I previously clicked on the 'Kata Library' link. Now I will navigate back to the home page by clicking the 'home' link in the header.
    
        3. I'm on the login screen, but I don't have any credentials to log in. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Instead of logging in, I will explore other publicly available links such as the 'Blog' link in the footer. I've already clicked 'Kata Library' and navigated 'home', so I will click 'Blog' to further explore the site.
    
        4. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I've already navigated to the Kata Library, Home page, and Blog. Now I should explore another main feature of the website. I will navigate to the 'For Educators' page.
    
        5. I am currently on the Partnerships page, which seems to be a login screen. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I don't have login credentials, I will explore other publicly available pages. I've already explored Blog and For Educators. I'll try clicking on 'For Companies'.
    
        6. I am on the Codewars Partnerships page, which appears to be a login screen as well. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on Kata Library, Home, Blog, For Educators, and For Companies. I should now click on 'Log in' to proceed further, but since I don't have any credentials, I will skip login for now and instead click on other links to explore publicly accessible areas. I will proceed to click on Privacy Policy at the bottom of the page.
    
        7. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. I have already navigated to the Kata Library, Home, Blog, For Educators, For Companies and Privacy Policy pages. I am currently on the partnerships page which is a login screen. I will explore public facing elements by clicking on the Terms of Service link in the footer.
    
        8. I am currently on the Terms of Service page. I have already explored several links in the footer, including Kata Library, Blog, For Educators, For Companies, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Service. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site and explore the main features. Since I don't have login credentials and I've navigated to a login screen, I will explore other publicly available links such as 'About'.
    
        9. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and exploring the main features. I have already clicked through several links in the footer. Now I will go back to the home page and click the Log in button to see what happens next.
    
        10. I'm on the login page. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test. I don't have any credentials. Therefore, I should explore publicly accessible links instead of attempting to log in. I will click on the 'About' link.
    
        11. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the website, which includes navigating the site and exploring the main features. Currently, I am on the 'About' page. Since I'm on the About page, which I reached in step 9, I'll try clicking on the 'API' link in the footer to further explore the site's features and content.
    
        12. I am currently on the user's profile page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked several links in the footer. Now, I will click on the 'Practice' link on the left-hand side navigation to explore the Kata section.
    
        13. I have already explored several links in the footer and the 'Practice' link. Now I will click on the 'Leaders' link to explore another main feature of the site as part of the smoke test.
    
        14. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on a few links including 'For Educators', 'For Companies', 'Privacy Policy', 'Terms of Service', 'About', 'Log In', 'API', 'Practice' and 'Leaders'. Now I will click on the 'Kata' link in the navigation bar to explore that section.
    
        15. I am on the Leaderboard page, the previous action was clicking the 'Kata' link, but since I'm on the Leaderboard page already, it did not navigate anywhere. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I've explored several links in the footer and header. Now I will explore some of the links for users on the leaderboard. I will choose the first user's link, 'g964'.
    
        16. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on several links. Now I will click on 'Ranks' to see the user's ranks.
    
        17. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, which includes exploring main features and verifying key elements. I've already navigated to a user profile. Now, I will click the 'Kata' link to see the Kata section. This continues the exploration of main features.
    
        18. I am on the Codewars Profile Page of user g964. I have previously clicked on 'Kata' in the profile. Now I will click on the 'Collections' link to explore another feature of the site as part of the smoke test.
    
        19. I have already navigated to the 'Collections' page for the user 'g964'. Now I will click the 'Kata' link on this page to navigate to the kata list.
    
        20. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I am currently on a user profile page. I will now click on the 'Social' link to explore that section of the site.
