        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I'll start by clicking on the 'About' link to learn more about Node.js.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore its main features. I previously clicked on the 'About' link. Now, I will explore the 'Download' section by clicking on the 'Download' link to learn about available downloads. This will help fulfill the goal of exploring main features.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked 'About' and 'Download'. Now I will click on 'Blog' to continue exploring the site's features.
    
        4. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'About', 'Download', and 'Blog'. Next, I will click on 'Docs' to explore another main feature.
    
        5. I am on the Node.js blog page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked 'About', 'Download', 'Blog', and 'Docs' in the past actions. Now I will click on 'API' to explore more.
    
        6. I have already navigated to the docs page. Now I will click on a random element to explore the features. I will click on the "HTTP" element.
    
        7. I've already navigated to the HTTP documentation page. Now I will click on a different link to further explore the documentation. I will click on the 'Usage and example' link to see more about the HTTP module.
    
        8. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I am currently on the documentation page for Node.js API synopsis, specifically the Usage and Example section. I have already clicked the 'Docs' link on the homepage, then 'HTTP', then 'Usage and example'. Now I will click on 'Assertion testing' to explore another feature.
    
        9. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, navigating the site, exploring features, and verifying key elements. I am currently on the 'Node.js v25.2.1 documentation' page, specifically the documentation for the 'assert' module. I have already navigated to the 'assert' documentation page. Now, let's explore some of the elements on this page.
    
        10. The goal is to smoke test the site by navigating and exploring main features. The current page is the Node.js assert documentation page. I have already navigated to the assert documentation and clicked on the Assert link. I will now explore some other links on the page, for example the Table of Contents.
    
        11. I have successfully navigated to the assert documentation and opened the table of contents. The goal is to generally navigate the site and explore key features. Clicking on other entries in the table of contents will help fulfill that goal.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I'm currently on the Node.js documentation page, specifically the test runner documentation. The history shows that I have already clicked on several links, including 'Test runner'. Now I'll click on another link within the 'Test runner' section of the documentation to further explore its features. I'll choose the 'Subtests' link.
    
        13. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I'm currently on the Subtests documentation page. I will explore other features related to the test runner to fulfill the 'explore main features' part of the goal. Clicking on 'Skipping tests' seems like a reasonable next step.
    
        14. I am currently on the 'Skipping Tests' documentation page of the Node.js test runner. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site by navigating and exploring main features. Since I have already navigated to the Test Runner documentation and then to the Skipping tests documentation, let me navigate to the 'Rerunning failed tests' documentation page to continue exploring the Test Runner documentation.
    
        15. I am currently on the 'Rerunning failed tests' documentation page. I've already navigated to the site, explored HTTP, Assertion testing, and the Test runner, including subtests, skipping tests, and rerunning failed tests sections. The goal is to continue exploring main features. I will now explore 'TODO tests' under the Test runner documentation.
    
        16. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Based on the history, I have already explored HTTP, Assert, and Test Runner APIs. I am currently on the Test Runner TODO Tests page. Now I will navigate back to the home page.
    
        17. I am on the Node.js home page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already navigated to several pages. Now, I will click on the 'Download' link to explore the download options.
    
        18. The goal is to do a smoke test of the website, and based on the history, I am currently on the download page. I will click on the 'Blog' link to explore another main feature.
    
        19. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, exploring main features. I have previously navigated to the Blog page. Now, I will explore the 'Releases' section to continue exploring the site's main features.
    
        20. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features of the Node.js website. The previous action was to click on 'Releases' in the blog section. Now, I will navigate to another main feature, 'Docs'.
