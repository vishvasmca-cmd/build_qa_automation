💭 Thought: The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I've already navigated to Google's landing page and clicked on Gmail, which led to a sign-in page, and navigated back to the google homepage. Since I don't have any credentials in `test_data` to log in, I will explore publicly accessible features. Clicking the 'About' link seems like a good next step to explore a static page.

I have already navigated to the main Google page, then clicked on Gmail, About, Store and then on Search for Images. I am now on the Google Images page. Since there are no elements listed, I should use the navigation bar to continue testing other features of Google Images. Since there are no elements listed in 'elements', I will have to explore by navigating. I will navigate back to the regular google search page.
