        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. I am on the login page, and I don't have any credentials to log in. Instead of logging in, I should explore publicly accessible areas of the site. The 'Sign in' button is present, but I can't use it without credentials. I will explore links on the page instead. I will click on the first available link with id 1.
    
        2. I am on the login page and I don't have any login credentials. I will skip the login for now and try to explore publicly available areas to satisfy the 'Autonomous smoke test' goal. I'll start by navigating back to the homepage.
    
        3. I am on the login page, and I don't have credentials. I will skip login for now and explore other parts of the site. I will click the 'Sign in' button, because, without credentials, it may take me back to the homepage or provide helpful options.
    
        4. I'm on the ACME Dashboard page. The goal is to navigate the site, explore the main features, and verify key elements. I will start by clicking on one of the main links in the page, such as 'Credit cards' to further navigate the website.
    
        5. I have already navigated to the app and clicked on 'Credit cards'. Now I will explore 'Debit cards'.
    
        6. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site and explore main features. The history shows I've clicked through 'Credit cards' and 'Debit cards'. Now I'll click on 'Loans' to continue exploring.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'Credit cards', 'Debit cards', and 'Loans'. Next, I should click on 'Mortgages'.
    
        8. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which involves exploring main features and verifying key elements. So far, I've clicked through the Credit cards, Debit cards, Loans, and Mortgages links. Next, I will click the 'Add Account' link to explore another feature on the dashboard.
    
        9. I am on the ACME Dashboard page. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already clicked through Credit cards, Debit cards, Loans, Mortgages and Add Account. Next I will click 'Make Payment'.
    
        10. I am on the ACME Dashboard page. I have already clicked on 'Credit cards', 'Debit cards', 'Loans', 'Mortgages', 'Add Account', and 'Make Payment'. Now I will click on the 'View Statement' button to explore another main feature.
    
        11. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the website. I have already clicked on the main features 'Credit cards', 'Debit cards', 'Loans', 'Mortgages', 'Add Account', 'Make Payment', and 'View Statement'.

        12. I have already navigated to the site, signed in, and clicked on 'Credit cards', 'Debit cards', 'Loans', 'Mortgages', 'Add Account', 'Make Payment', 'View Statement', and 'Request Increase'. Now I will click on Pay Now to further explore the main features of the site.
    
        13. I have already clicked on 'Credit cards', 'Debit cards', 'Loans', 'Mortgages', 'Add Account', 'Make Payment', 'View Statement', 'Request Increase', and 'Pay Now'. Since the goal is to explore main features and verify key elements, and there are other clickable elements available, I will click on 'Restaurant / Cafe'.
    
        14. I am on the ACME Banking App page, and I have already clicked several main navigation buttons. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements, so now I will click on the 'Finance' link to navigate to a different section of the app.
    
        15. I am on the ACME Dashboard page. I have clicked on Debit cards, Loans, Mortgages, Add Account, Make Payment, View Statement, Request Increase, Pay Now, Restaurant / Cafe, and Finance in the past. I will click Software button.
