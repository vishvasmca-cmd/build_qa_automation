        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I am currently on the PayPal US homepage. I will explore the 'Personal' section of the site to begin exploring the main features.
    
        2. The goal is to perform a smoke test, and I've already clicked on 'Personal'. Now I'll click on 'Shopping & Rewards' to explore another main feature.
    
        3. I am currently on the PayPal US | Digital Wallet | Ways to Pay page. I have already clicked on 'Personal' and 'Shopping & Rewards'. Now I will explore the footer links to further navigate the site.
    
        4. I have already clicked on Personal, then Shopping & Rewards, and then scrolled. Now I will click on one of the FAQ buttons to explore the main features and verify key elements as per the goal. I'll choose 'Where can I shop using PayPal?'
    
        5. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. The previous steps involved navigating to the 'Ways to Pay' page and clicking on 'Where can I shop using PayPal?'. Now I will click on 'What are the different ways to pay with PayPal?' to continue exploring main features.
    
        6. I have already clicked on 'Where can I shop using PayPal?' and 'What are the different ways to pay with PayPal?'. Now I will explore 'Is PayPal a secure payment method?' to continue exploring the main features and verify key elements as per the goal.
    
        7. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test of the site. I've already clicked a few of the frequently asked question accordions on the page. Now, I will click the last available FAQ accordion to continue exploring main features. Then scroll to the bottom.
    
        8. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, navigating the site and exploring main features. The history shows I've clicked the first four accordion buttons. The next step is to click the fifth accordion button.
    
        9. I have already clicked the 4 expand buttons. Now I should try some other links on the page. I will click on 'Add Cards and Banks'
    
        10. I'm currently on the 'Add Payment Method' page. My goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. Since I'm already on a page related to adding payment methods, I'll explore adding a card as a key feature.
    
        11. The current page indicates that the IP has been blocked from accessing the PayPal login page. Since the goal is to navigate the site and explore main features, and the login is blocked, I should submit feedback to report the issue, and mark the goal as unachieved as the system is blocked.
