        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since there are no credentials, I will skip signing in or getting a free trial. Instead, I'll start by clicking the 'Platform' button to explore that section of the site.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked the 'Platform' button. Now I will click the 'Product' button to further explore the site's features.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on 'Platform' and 'Product' buttons. Now, I will click on the 'Pricing' button to explore the pricing options.
    
        4. I am on the GitLab homepage which is a login screen, and the goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on Platform, Product, and Pricing. I should now click on 'Sign in' to see what the options are.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows I've already clicked on 'Platform', 'Product', and 'Pricing'. The current page is the 'GitLab Pricing' page. Now I will explore the 'Resources' button.
    
        6. I am on the Pricing page and the 'Resources' menu is open. The goal is to explore main features. I will explore the 'View all resources' link inside the opened 'Resources' menu.
    
        7. I have already navigated to the Resources page. Now, I will explore one of the resources listed on this page, such as the Knowledge Base. This will help fulfill the goal of exploring main features and verifying key elements.
    
        8. I am currently on a Cloudflare verification page. I don't have credentials to bypass it. I will click the 'Cloudflare' link, which might lead to a public page or more information about Cloudflare's protection.
