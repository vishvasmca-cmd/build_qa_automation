        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The current page is the Flask documentation. I will start by clicking on the 'Quickstart' link to explore one of the main features.
    
        2. The goal is to explore the main features of the Flask documentation site after navigating to it. I've already clicked the 'Quickstart' link. Now I will explore the links on the left side of the page to explore more main features. I see many such links. I'll just pick one to click.
    
        3. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. The last action was navigating to the installation page. Now I will explore the 'Dependencies' link to explore the main features.
    
        4. The goal is to navigate the site, explore the main features and verify the key elements. I have already clicked on the Quickstart, navigated to the Installation page and clicked on the Dependencies link. Now, I'll click on the 'Virtual environments' link to continue exploring the main features.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on Quickstart, navigated to Installation, and clicked on Dependencies and Virtual environments. Now, I will click on 'Python Version' link to continue exploring different sections of the installation page.
    
        6. I'm currently on the 'Installation' page of the Flask documentation, and I've already clicked on several sub-sections within this page. The goal is to explore the site and verify key elements. Now I'll go to the next section on the installation page.
    
        7. I have already navigated to the installation page and clicked several links within it. Now I will click the 'Documentation Overview' link to further explore the site's features.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked through several installation-related pages. Now, I will go to the 'tutorial' section to explore another key feature of Flask documentation.
    
        9. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. The current page is the Flask tutorial. I will click on 'Project Layout' to explore another main feature. This should navigate to the project layout section of the tutorial.
