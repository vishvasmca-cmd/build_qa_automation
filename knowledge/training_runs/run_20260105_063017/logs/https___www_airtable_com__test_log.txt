💭 Thought: The current page is the Airtable homepage, but it's showing the login screen because there are no interactive elements to explore the main features. Since I don't have login credentials, I'll skip logging in and instead look for publicly accessible links in the footer or other navigation areas to continue exploring the site and fulfilling the smoke test goal.

        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The first step is to close the promo banner if it exists, then explore the 'AI Plays' section as a primary feature.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already closed the promo banner. Since I don't have login credentials, I'll explore publicly available features. I'll start by clicking the 'Platform' button to explore its features.
    
        3. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Platform' in the navigation bar. Now, let's click on 'Solutions' to explore another main feature.
    
        4. I have already clicked 'Platform' and 'Solutions'. The next button to click is 'Resources' to continue exploring the main navigation. This aligns with the goal to 'Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'.
    
        5. I've already clicked 'Platform', 'Solutions', and 'Resources'. Now I will click on the 'Pricing' button to explore another main feature.
    
        6. I have already clicked through the main navigation items (Platform, Solutions, Resources, Pricing). Since I have no credentials, I will not attempt to log in. Instead, I'll explore publicly accessible links in the footer of the page to explore main features further.
    
        7. The goal is to smoke test the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already clicked 'Platform', 'Solutions', 'Resources', and 'Pricing'. Now I will scroll to the bottom of the page to see key elements at the bottom of the page.
    
        8. I've already navigated to the pricing page and scrolled down. The next step in the goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements, which I can do by clicking on the 'Platform', 'Solutions', and 'Resources' buttons in the navigation bar, and generally exploring the page. I'll start by clicking the 'Platform' button again to re-explore that menu.
    
        9. The goal is 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. I have already navigated to the pricing page, clicked on Platform, Solutions and Resources in the header. There are no credentials so I will avoid logging in. I can explore the pricing page by scrolling again.
    
        10. The goal is to smoke test the site by navigating and exploring main features. I have already navigated to the pricing page and clicked the Platform button. Next, I will explore platform features.
    
        11. I have navigated to the pricing page and explored Platform Features. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements on the site. Next I will explore Integrations.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'Platform', 'Solutions', 'Resources', and 'Pricing'. I also clicked on Platform Features and Integrations. Now I should scroll to explore the page. Since I am at the pricing page and have explored some of the features, I will now scroll to see more content.
    
        13. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I have already navigated to the pricing page, clicked Platform, Platform Features, and Integrations. I'll now navigate to the home page using the element with text "Airtable home or view your bases".
