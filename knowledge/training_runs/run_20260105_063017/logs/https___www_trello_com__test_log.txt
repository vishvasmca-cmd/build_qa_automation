        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to explore the main features of the Trello website. Since the current page is the login screen, I should explore publicly accessible links instead of logging in since I have no credentials. I will start by clicking on the 'Features' button.
    
        2. The goal is to explore the main features of the Trello site. The previous action was to click the 'Features' button. Now I will click the 'Solutions' button to continue exploring.
    
        3. I am on the Trello landing page and my goal is to smoke test the site. I have already clicked the 'Features' and 'Solutions' buttons. Next, I should click the 'Plans' button to explore that section of the website.
    
        4. I am on the Trello landing page. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features of the site. I have already clicked on 'Features', 'Solutions', and 'Plans'. Next, I should click on 'Pricing' to continue exploring the main navigation links.
    
        5. The page context indicates I am on the Trello Pricing page. I have already clicked 'Features', 'Solutions', 'Plans', and 'Pricing' in the navigation. Since the goal is to explore main features, I will click on the 'About Trello' link in the footer to explore another part of the website.
    
        6. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, navigating the site and exploring main features. Based on the history, I've clicked through the main navigation items (Features, Solutions, Plans, Pricing) and the 'About Trello' link. Since I am on the 'About Trello' page, and the goal is to explore the site, I will navigate back to the homepage by clicking the Trello Logo in the header.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'Features', 'Solutions', 'Plans', 'Pricing', 'About Trello', and 'Atlassian Trello' (navigating back to home). There are still elements on the homepage to explore. Next, I will click on 'Resources'.
    
        8. I have already clicked on Features, Solutions, Plans, Pricing, About Trello, Atlassian Trello, and Resources. Now, I will click on Log in to explore the login feature.
    
        9. I have reached the login screen. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, but I don't have credentials. Therefore, I will skip the login attempt and explore publicly available areas instead. I will navigate back to the homepage to start exploring other available links.
    
        10. The goal is to smoke test the site by navigating and exploring. The last action returned to the home page. Now, I will click on the 'Features' button to explore the features section.
    
        11. The goal is to explore the main features of the Trello website. The history shows that I have already clicked on 'Features', 'Solutions', 'Plans', 'Pricing', 'About Trello', 'Atlassian Trello', 'Resources', 'Log in' and 'Features' again. Now I will click on the 'Templates' to continue exploring main features and verify key elements.
