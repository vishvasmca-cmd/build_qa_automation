        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I am currently on the GitHub landing page. I will start by clicking the 'Pricing' link to explore the pricing page. There are two 'Pricing' links (id=19 and id=20), and I'll select the first one (id=19) as it is an anchor tag (<a>) which usually represents a navigable link.
    
        2. I am currently on the pricing page, and the goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I'm already on the pricing page, I will go to the homepage next to explore more features from there.
    
        3. I have already navigated to the pricing page and then back to the homepage. Now, I want to explore one of the main features. I'll start with 'Platform'.
    
        4. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features of the site. I am currently on the GitHub homepage, and I have already clicked on 'Pricing' and 'Platform'. Next, I will click on 'Solutions' to explore another main feature.
    
        5. I have already navigated to the Pricing page, then back to the Homepage, clicked 'Platform' and then 'Solutions'. The next step is to click 'Resources'.
    
        6. I have already navigated to the homepage and clicked on Platform, Solutions, and Resources. Now, I will proceed to click on Pricing to explore another main feature of the site as per the user's goal. I am back on the homepage because I previously clicked 'Homepage'.
    
        7. I am on the Github homepage, which is also the login screen. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features and verify key elements. I have already clicked on pricing, homepage, platform, solutions, resources and pricing again in the previous steps. I should continue exploring by clicking on more elements on the page, such as 'Sign in' to verify key elements or explore other available options. However, since I do not have any login credentials, I will skip the login attempt and just click on the 'Start a free trial' button.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on several buttons, including 'Pricing', 'Homepage', 'Platform', 'Solutions', 'Resources', and 'Pricing' again. Now I will click on the 'Open Source' button to further explore the site. The previous attempt to click on the element with empty text failed because the element may no longer be present on the page.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'Homepage', 'Platform', 'Solutions', 'Resources', 'Pricing', and 'Open Source' buttons. Now, I will explore the 'Enterprise' button.
    
        10. The goal is to smoke test the site. I have already clicked a few buttons. Let's return to the homepage to restart exploring the main features. The current page is the pricing page. I will click the 'Homepage' link.
    
        11. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have clicked on multiple main buttons. I will now click on the Pricing button to further explore the site. I have already tried clicking on the pricing button once. It may have changed the URL.
    
        12. I have clicked on the Homepage, Platform, Solutions, Resources, Open Source, and Enterprise pages. I am currently on the Pricing page. I will now attempt to explore the footer element.
    
        13. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features. Based on the history, I have already clicked on Platform, Solutions, Resources, Pricing, Open Source, Enterprise, then Homepage, then Pricing again, and scrolled. The current page is the Pricing page. I'll now click on a few of the 'details' elements to expand and verify they work. I will start with the first one, 'Unlimited public/private repositories'.
    
        14. I have navigated to the pricing page, explored Open Source and Enterprise options, clicked 'Homepage', and then went back to the pricing page. I've also scrolled and clicked on 'Unlimited public/private repositories'. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I will continue exploring the features on the current page by clicking on 'Dependabot security and version updates'.
    
        15. I've already clicked 'Unlimited public/private repositories' and 'Dependabot security and version updates' on the Pricing page. Now, I'll click '2,000 CI/CD minutes/month Free for public repositories' to explore another feature on the pricing page as part of the smoke test.
    
        16. The goal is to smoke test the site. I'm currently on the Pricing page and have already clicked on several elements. I will now navigate to the homepage using the 'Homepage' link.
    
        17. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore its main features and verify key elements. I have already navigated to the homepage and the pricing page, and clicked a few links on the pricing page, then returned to the homepage. Now I will click on some of the other main navigation buttons to explore the site's features. I will start with the 'Platform' button.
    
        18. The goal is to explore the main features of the site. I am currently on the homepage, and the previous action was to click on the 'Platform' button. Now, I should select one of the options available under the 'Platform' dropdown menu, which is not listed as an element. I will instead click another button on the header, like 'Solutions'.
    
        19. The goal is to navigate the site and explore key features. I have already clicked on "Platform" and "Solutions" buttons on the homepage. Next, I will click on the "Resources" button to explore more main features.
    
        20. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'Homepage', 'Pricing', and then some elements on the pricing page, and then returned to the homepage and clicked 'Platform', 'Solutions', and 'Resources'. Now, I will click on the 'Open Source' button to explore that feature.
