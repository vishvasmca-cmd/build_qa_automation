        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to do a smoke test of the website. A good first step is to explore the main navigation by clicking on the 'Docs' button.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked the "Docs" button. Now, I will click on the "Ecosystem" button to further explore the site's features.
    
        3. I have already clicked on Docs and Ecosystem. Now I will click on the 'About' button to continue exploring main features.
    
        4. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test of the Vue.js site. The history shows I have already clicked the 'Docs', 'Ecosystem', and 'About' buttons. Next, I will click the 'Partners' button under the 'Ecosystem' menu to further explore the main features.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features of the site. I have already clicked on 'Docs', 'Ecosystem', 'About', and 'Partners'. Now I will click on the 'Search' button to explore the search functionality.
    
        6. I have already clicked on Docs, Ecosystem, About, Partners, and Search button. Now I will click on Sponsor button for autonomous smoke test and to explore main features and verify key elements
    
        7. I have already clicked through several main navigation buttons. The current page is the partners page. Now I will click on the Vue.js logo to return to the homepage.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked on Docs, Ecosystem, About, Partners, Search, Sponsor, and Vue.js (the logo). I will now click on 'Why Vue' to continue exploring.
    
        9. I have already clicked on the Docs, Ecosystem, About, Partners, Search, Sponsor, Vue.js (logo), and Why Vue links. There are other main features to explore on the homepage. I will click on 'Get Started' to navigate to the getting started page.
    
        10. I have clicked on the main navigation items including Docs, Ecosystem, About, Search, Sponsor, Vue.js, Why Vue, and Get Started. Now I will attempt to click on the 'Install' link to explore another part of the site.
    
        11. I am on the homepage, where I've clicked several navigation links already. The page context indicates that the page has an error obscuring the main content. Since the goal is to explore the main features, I will attempt to use the 'Skip to content' link to bypass the security error.
    
        12. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring the main features. I have already clicked on a few links. Now I will click on the 'Docs' button to explore documentation.
    
        13. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on several links. Now I will click on Ecosystem to explore more of the site.
    
        14. The goal is to smoke test the site. I have already clicked several buttons, including Docs and Ecosystem. Now I will explore the API documentation by clicking the 'API' link.
    
        15. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on several links. The current page is the Vue.js API Reference. I will click on the 'Ecosystem' button again to explore its sub-menus.
    
        16. I have navigated to several pages and clicked on several elements already. Now, I will click on the About button to explore another feature.
    
        17. I am on the Vue.js API Reference page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on the 'About' button. Now I will click on the 'Sponsor' button to further explore.
    
        18. The goal is to navigate and explore main features. I've already clicked through a few top-level navigation items. I will now click on a specific API element, 'createApp()', to see where it leads.
    
        19. I have already navigated to the Vue.js API documentation page for `createApp`. Now I will explore the 'Ecosystem' button to navigate to a different part of the site as part of exploring main features.
    
        20. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already navigated to the createApp documentation page and clicked on Ecosystem twice. Now I will try clicking on 'Partners' to explore the ecosystem further.
