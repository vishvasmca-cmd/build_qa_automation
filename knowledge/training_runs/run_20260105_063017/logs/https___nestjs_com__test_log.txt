        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The current page is the landing page. The next logical step is to click on the 'Documentation' button to learn about the framework.
    
        2. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, and I've already clicked on the 'Documentation' link. Now I need to further explore the main features and verify key elements within the documentation site. Since no interactive elements are visible, I'll scroll to see if more content appears.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already navigated to the main page and scrolled. Now, I will click on one of the main navigation links to explore a feature. I will click on 'First steps' as it's likely a core part of the documentation.
    
        4. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, exploring main features and verifying key elements. The history shows I have already navigated to the documentation, scrolled, and clicked on 'First steps'. Now, I should explore other main features such as 'Controllers', 'Providers' and 'Modules'. I will click 'Controllers' to navigate to the controllers documentation page.
    
        5. I am currently on the NestJS documentation page for controllers. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to the 'Controllers' page. Next, I will click on 'Providers' to explore another main feature.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to the documentation page, scrolled, and clicked on 'First steps', 'Controllers', and 'Providers'. Now, I will click on 'Modules' to continue exploring the main features.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already navigated to Modules page. Now I will navigate to the Middleware page. This will help me explore the site further.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already navigated to Documentation, First steps, Controllers, Providers, Modules, and Middleware pages. Now I'll navigate to the next item in the sidebar, 'Exception filters'.
    
        9. I have already navigated to the 'Exception filters' page. Now, I will explore another main feature, 'Pipes'.
    
        10. I have navigated to several documentation pages, according to the history. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. Let's continue exploring the sidebar navigation. I will click on 'Guards' next.
    
        11. I have already navigated to multiple pages including 'First steps', 'Controllers', 'Providers', 'Modules', 'Middleware', 'Exception filters', 'Pipes', and 'Guards'. Now I need to click on 'Interceptors' to continue exploring the main features.
    
        12. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site by navigating and exploring its main features and verifying key elements. So far, I have navigated to several pages under the 'Fundamentals' section of the documentation. I will now continue exploring other links in the sidebar by clicking 'Custom decorators'.
    
        13. I've already navigated through all the 'FUNDAMENTALS' links. Now, I need to explore other main features. I will start with 'CLI' under the 'STANDALONE APPS' section.
    
        14. I have already clicked through many of the links on the page. The goal is to explore the main features. The next main section to explore on the page after Custom decorators and CLI is OPENAPI, so I will click that.
    
        15. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Based on the history, I have already clicked through several of the Fundamentals and CLI, OPENAPI links. I will now click on the 'RECIPES' link to continue exploring the main features.
    
        16. I have already clicked through several elements on the page. Now I will click 'Enterprise' to explore another part of the site.
    
        17. The goal is to navigate and explore main features and verify key elements. I have already clicked on many of the main navigation links and then 'Enterprise' at the bottom. Now, I will navigate to the 'Deploy Nest' link in the footer.
    
        18. I have already clicked on several elements on the page, including navigation items and footer links. I will now click the Github repository link to navigate to the project's Github page and further explore the site.
    
        19. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The previous actions have clicked on several elements. It's time to explore the "First steps" link to continue exploring the site's main features.
    
        20. I have navigated to several pages already. My goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. Let me explore the 'Controllers' link in the left navigation. Since I've already navigated to First steps, Guards, Interceptors, Custom decorators, CLI, OPENAPI, RECIPES, Enterprise, Deploy Nest, and Github repository, Controllers seems like a good next choice from the sidebar. The current page is 'First steps' from the sidebar, according to the title.
