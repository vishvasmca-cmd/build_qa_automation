        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I will start by clicking the 'Features' link in the navigation bar.
    
        2. I am on the Features page. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I will click on the 'Learn' link to explore the learning resources.
    
        3. I have already navigated to the Features page and the Learn page, as per the history. Now I will explore the main navigation bar at the top, clicking on 'Reference'.
    
        4. I have already clicked on 'Features', 'Learn', and 'Reference'. The next element in the navigation is 'FastAPI People'. I will click on that next.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already clicked on 'Features', 'Learn', 'Reference', and 'FastAPI People'. Now I should click on 'Resources' to continue exploring the site's main features.
    
        6. I am on the 'FastAPI Resources' page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked 'Features', 'Learn', 'Reference', 'FastAPI People', and 'Resources' links. Now I will click on 'About' to explore another main feature.
    
        7. The goal is to smoke test the FastAPI website, which includes navigating to key pages. I've already navigated to Features, Learn, Reference, FastAPI People, Resources, and About. I will now navigate to Release Notes to continue exploring the main features.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Based on the history, I have already clicked all the top-level navigation links. To further explore, I will click on the "Alternatives, Inspiration and Comparisons" link at the bottom of the page. I will click the link with id 50.
    
        9. I've navigated to the Release Notes page. Now I should explore some elements on this page to verify key elements. I will click on the 'Latest Changes' link to explore a specific release.
    
        10. I have already explored main navigation options and landed on the release notes page and clicked on 'latest changes' anchor link. Now I need to explore more links on the current page. I will now click the 'Translations' link under the release notes.
    
        11. I have already explored main features, and verified key elements. Now I will click on Internal to explore further.
    
        12. I have navigated to the Release Notes page and clicked on several links within that page. I should now click on the "Select language" button to explore the available languages and then choose a language. Then I will search for a specific term.
    
        13. I have navigated the site and explored some main features. Now, I will select a language to test the functionality. Since I've already clicked 'Select language', I will now select 'en - English'.
    
        14. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site by navigating and exploring main features. I've already clicked through a few links. I will now click the 'Features' link in the navigation bar to explore that section.
    
        15. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which involves navigating the site, exploring its main features, and verifying key elements. I'm currently on the Features page, so I will explore the main navigation links to continue exploring main features.
    
        16. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I've already navigated to the Learn section. Now I'll explore the 'Tutorial - User Guide' under the 'Learn' section. This will help explore a main feature of the site.
    
        17. I have navigated to the Tutorial - User Guide page. Now I will explore some of the tutorial content. The next logical step is to click on 'First Steps'.
    
        18. The current page is 'FastAPI Tutorial - First Steps'. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features and verify key elements. I am currently on the 'First Steps' tutorial page. A logical next step is to navigate to the next tutorial page, 'Path Parameters'.
    
        19. I am currently on the 'Path Parameters' tutorial page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I will now navigate to the 'Query Parameters' page in the tutorial.
