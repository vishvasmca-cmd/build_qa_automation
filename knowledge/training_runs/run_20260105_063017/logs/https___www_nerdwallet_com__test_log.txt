        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I see several main navigation options at the top of the page (Credit cards, Banking, Home, etc.). I will start by clicking on 'Credit Cards'.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The previous action was clicking on 'Credit cards'. Now I will click on 'Best credit cards' to further explore the credit card section.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate and explore the site. I've already clicked on 'Credit cards' and 'Best credit cards'. Now, I'll click on 'Compare credit cards' to continue exploring the credit card section.
    
        4. I have already clicked on 'Credit cards', 'Best credit cards' and 'Compare credit cards'. Now I will click on 'Get a card recommendation' to explore another main feature as described in the goal.
    
        5. I have already navigated to the Credit Card Comparison page as per the history. Now I want to explore main features. Since there are many buttons related to card types, I will click on the 'REWARDS' button to see the rewards credit cards.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked through several credit card related links. Now I will click on the Banking link to explore another main feature.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows that I clicked on Credit Cards, then 'Best Credit Cards', then 'Compare Credit Cards' and 'Get a card recommendation' and then 'Rewards' and 'Banking'. Now that I'm on a page with credit card comparison, I will click on Home in the header to navigate back to the home page to explore other sections. The header contains the main navigation for the site.
    
        8. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which involves navigating the site, exploring main features, and verifying key elements. The history shows I've clicked on 'Credit Cards', 'Best credit cards', 'Compare credit cards', 'Get a card recommendation', 'REWARDS', 'Banking', and 'Home'. I'm currently on the credit card comparison page, according to the page context. The next logical step is to click through other main navigation items like 'Loans'.
    
        9. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and exploring the main features. The page context indicates that I'm on a credit card comparison page, and the history shows a series of navigation actions have been performed. Now, I should click on another section 'Insurance' to further explore the site's main features.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already explored the Credit Cards, Rewards, Banking, Home, Loans, and Insurance sections. Now I will click on 'Personal finance' to further explore the site.
    
        11. I have already clicked on several buttons. Now I will click on the Investing button to explore another main feature as per the smoke test goal.
    
        12. I have already clicked on several elements on the page, including 'Investing'. Now I'll try clicking on 'Small business' to explore another main feature.
    
        13. I have already clicked through most of the main navigation items on the page. I will now click on Taxes to continue exploring the main features. The goal is to navigate and verify elements.
    
        14. I have already clicked through several of the top navigation options. Now I will attempt to use the search bar to search for a specific card.
    
        15. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on many of the navigation options in the header, and filled the 'Search card name' input field. Since the search bar has been filled (but no search terms were provided in test_data), I will click the Credit Cards Hub link to explore the general credit card landing page.
