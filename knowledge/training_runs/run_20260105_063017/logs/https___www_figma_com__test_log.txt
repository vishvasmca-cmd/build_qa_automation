        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I am currently on the homepage in what appears to be a login state. I will start by exploring the 'Products' menu to demonstrate navigation and feature discovery.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The previous action was clicking the 'Products' button. Now I will click on 'Solutions' to continue exploring the main features.
    
        3. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site by navigating and exploring main features. I have already clicked on the 'Products' and 'Solutions' buttons. Now, I will click on the 'Community' button to continue exploring the main navigation features.
    
        4. I am on the Figma homepage. I have clicked on Products, Solutions, and Community. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Next, I will click on the 'Resources' button.
    
        5. I am on the Figma homepage. I have clicked on the Products, Solutions, Community, and Resources buttons in the header. The next step in the goal is to explore the main features of the site. I will click on the 'Pricing' link in the header to explore the pricing page.
    
        6. I am on the Figma homepage, and I have already clicked on Products, Solutions, Community, Resources, and Pricing. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I will now click on the 'Log in' button to navigate to the login page and verify elements there, as it is a major part of the site.
    
        7. I am on the Figma Pricing page, which is also the login screen. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked through the main navigation links: 'Products', 'Solutions', 'Community', 'Resources', and 'Pricing'. I have also attempted to log in, but I don't have credentials, so I will skip that part. Instead of logging in, I will go to the homepage to explore the main features from there.
    
        8. I've navigated to the pricing page, then the Login page, then back to the Homepage. Now I will attempt to explore the main features, by navigating to the products page.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I was on the pricing page but I was clicking around top buttons and got lost. I will go back to the homepage and start from there again. There are no login credentials, so I will avoid logging in and explore the site as a guest.
    
        10. The goal is 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. The previous actions in history show that I clicked through main navigation buttons. Now I'm back on the homepage. Next, I will click the 'Products' button to explore it's elements.
    
        11. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on multiple elements in the header. Now I will click on some of the elements in the product section of the page.
    
        12. I have navigated to the Figma Design page, clicked on 'Solutions', 'Community', 'Resources', 'Pricing', 'Log in', 'Homepage' and 'Products'. Then I clicked on 'Figma Design Design and prototype in one place'. Now I will click on 'Dev Mode Translate designs into code' to explore the main features of the website.
    
        13. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The previous steps clicked on several options under products and now I am on the Dev Mode page. I will now click on the FigJam to continue exploring main features.
    
        14. I have already navigated to the Figma Design, Dev Mode, and FigJam pages. Next, I will navigate to Figma Slides page to continue exploring the main features as part of the autonomous smoke test.
    
        15. I have already navigated to Figma Design, Dev Mode, FigJam, and Figma Slides. Now I will complete the navigation by clicking Figma Draw. The goal is to explore main features.
    
        16. I've already navigated through several products. Now I'll explore Solutions to further explore main features as requested in the goal.
    
        17. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, which involves navigating the site and exploring main features. I'm currently on the Figma Draw landing page, and have clicked through products. Next, I will explore Solutions.
    
        18. I have clicked on 'Solutions' twice already. The next logical step in exploring the main features would be to click on 'Community'.
    
        19. I have already explored 'Products', 'Solutions' and 'Community'. Now, I will explore 'Resources' to continue smoke testing the website and explore the main features.
    
        20. I have already navigated through the 'Products', 'Solutions', 'Community', and 'Resources' buttons. Now, I will navigate to the 'Pricing' page to explore the pricing options as part of the autonomous smoke test.
