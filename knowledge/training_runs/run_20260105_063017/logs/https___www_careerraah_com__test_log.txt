        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The page appears to be a login screen. Since `test_data` is empty, I will skip login and instead click the CareerRaah Home link to navigate to the public home page.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on 'CareerRaah Home'. Now, I will click on the 'Blog' link to explore another main feature of the site.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I'm currently on the home page, after having visited the Blog page. Now, I will click on 'Contact Us' to explore another main feature of the website.
    
        4. The current page is the login screen, and the goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. Since there are no credentials available, I will skip the login and instead explore publicly available content. I will start by exploring the first available blog article.
    
        5. I have navigated to the contact page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I am on the contact page and the page context indicates it is a contact form, I will go back to the home page to explore other main features.
    
        6. The goal is to perform a smoke test of the site, exploring main features and verifying key elements. The bot has already navigated to the homepage, blog and contact us page and also one blog article and again back to the home page. Now, I will click on the 'QA Playground' link to explore the QA automation features.
    
        7. I have already clicked on Home, Blog, Contact Us, another blog post, Home again and QA Playground. There are other courses listed on the homepage. I will click on one of them to continue exploring the main features as per the goal description.
    
        8. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which includes navigating the site, exploring main features, and verifying key elements. The history shows that I have already clicked on 'CareerRaah Home', 'Blog', 'Contact Us', 'How to Join the NDA After Class 12th: A Complete Guide', 'CareerRaah Home', 'QA Playground', and '📚 Basic AI Course'. Now I will click on the 'Login' button since I haven't logged in and I don't have credentials, so I'll skip this step.
    
        9. The user's goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I am currently on a login screen. The history shows that the user clicked the Login button on this page. Because I don't have any credentials in test_data, I will explore other parts of the site. I will navigate to the 'Home' page from the footer to explore other features and elements on the website.
    
        10. I am on the login screen, and the goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I don't have any login credentials, I will skip logging in and instead navigate back to the home page to explore publicly available content.
    
        11. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already navigated to different parts of the website and also clicked on some courses. Since the page is a login screen and I don't have any login credentials in the test data. I will skip the login and explore some publicly accessible areas like the footer links. Clicking on the Privacy Policy link in the footer.
    
        12. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. The last action was clicking 'Privacy Policy', and now the page is on the privacy policy page. Since there are no credentials, I'll skip the login functionality for now and continue exploring the site. The next logical step is to return to the homepage and then explore the main features listed as elements.
    
        13. The current goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features. The history shows I've already navigated to the blog, contact page, QA playground, a basic AI course, the login page, home page, and privacy policy. Since the current page is the login screen, and there are no credentials provided, I will skip login and instead click on another main feature, such as the 'AI Tutor' link to explore further.
    
        14. I am currently on the landing page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features, then verify key elements. I have already clicked on several elements including a course and the AI Tutor link. There are other courses listed on the home page. I should click on one of them.
    
        15. I am currently on the login screen after attempting to access the Advanced AI Course. I don't have credentials to log in. Instead of logging in, I will click on the CareerRaah Home link to navigate back to the homepage and explore other features.
    
        16. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have clicked on several links already including QA Playground, Basic AI Course, Login, Home, Privacy Policy, AI Tutor, and Advanced AI Course. I'll click on another course, Prompt Mastery, to continue exploring.
    
        17. I have navigated to multiple pages already. Now I will click on Module 1 to explore the main features and verify the key elements
    
        18. I have already clicked on the first module. I will now click on the second module to continue exploring the course.
    
        19. I am currently on the Prompt Engineering Fundamentals page, and I have already clicked on the 'Module 2 Best Practices' link in the previous step. The goal is to explore the main features of the website. Since I am now on the Module 1 page, I should click on the 'Next: Best Practices' button to proceed to the next module.
    
        20. I am currently on the 'Prompt Mastery - Module 1' page. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I have already clicked 'Next: Best Practices' in the previous step, so it is time to click the next button to continue through the modules. The next button will navigate us to the next module page.
