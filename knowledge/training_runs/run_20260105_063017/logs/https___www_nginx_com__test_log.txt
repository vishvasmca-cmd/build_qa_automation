        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I will start by clicking on the 'Products' button in the navigation bar. This should navigate to a page listing the products.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows that I have already clicked the 'PRODUCTS' button. Now, I will click on one of the products listed, for example, 'NGINX One', to explore its features.
    
        3. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. The previous step clicked on 'NGINX One'. I'll now click on 'F5 WAF for NGINX and F5 DoS for NGINX (Open)' to continue exploring the product features.
    
        4. I am on the F5 NGINX product page. I have already clicked on PRODUCTS, NGINX One, and F5 WAF for NGINX and F5 DoS for NGINX. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements. I will click on 'Try NGINX Free'.
    
        5. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features. The previous action failed because the element was not found, so I'll try a different approach. Since the previous action attempted to open an element without a text label, I will click on the 'SOLUTIONS' button to explore that section of the website.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've clicked on PRODUCTS and SOLUTIONS previously. Let's explore the 'RESOURCES' button next.
    
        7. The goal is to perform a smoke test by exploring the main features of the F5 site. I have already clicked on PRODUCTS, NGINX One, F5 WAF for NGINX and F5 DoS for NGINX, SOLUTIONS, and RESOURCES. Now, I will click on the 'SUPPORT' button to explore this section.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on PRODUCTS, SOLUTIONS, RESOURCES, and SUPPORT. Now I will click on the COMPANY button to continue exploring the site's main features.
    
        9. I have already clicked SOLUTIONS, RESOURCES, SUPPORT and COMPANY buttons. Now I will explore the PRODUCTS menu.
    
        10. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, exploring main features and verifying key elements. I've already clicked on multiple menu options at the top of the page. Now I will explore the PRODUCTS section in the navigation bar.
    
        11. I have already navigated to the Products page several times and clicked on several nav items. I will now click the Free Trials link in the header to explore that functionality. The goal is to smoke test the site, so exploring the main features like free trials is a reasonable action.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features of the site. I've already clicked through several top-level navigation items (SOLUTIONS, RESOURCES, SUPPORT, COMPANY, PRODUCTS) based on the history. I am currently on the product page. I will now click the 'Free Trials' button to explore another area of the site.
    
        13. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test which includes navigating the site and exploring the main features. I have already clicked on a few options like 'FREE TRIALS'. Now I will click the 'SOLUTIONS' button to explore that section.
    
        14. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on several top-level navigation items. Now I will click on one of the product links to explore product offerings.
    
        15. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I previously clicked on 'Content delivery network (CDN) (Open)'. Now I will click on 'Enterprise DNS (Open)' to explore another feature.
    
        16. I have successfully navigated through the PRODUCTS menu and explored several sub-elements like 'Content delivery network (CDN)' and 'Enterprise DNS'. Now I will further explore the SOLUTIONS menu to accomplish the goal of exploring the main features of the site and verifying key elements.
    
        17. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've clicked through several top-level nav items. Now I'll try clicking the 'RESOURCES' button.
    
        18. I am on the 'Resources' dropdown menu, according to the page context. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features and verify key elements. I have already clicked on several navigation items. I will now click on 'Contact F5'.
    
        19. The current goal is a smoke test, which involves navigating the site and verifying key elements. Based on the history, I've interacted with several navigation elements. The current page is the landing page, and I've already explored 'PRODUCTS', 'FREE TRIALS', 'SOLUTIONS', and 'RESOURCES', and 'Contact F5'. I'll now explore the 'PARTNERS' section by clicking the 'PARTNERS' button. The goal is to ensure all key navigation elements are functional.
    
        20. I am on the F5 Hybrid Multicloud Application Delivery page. The goal is to explore the main features and verify key elements of the site. The last action was to click on the 'Partners' menu item, which is currently displaying a dropdown. Now I will click on the 'SOLUTIONS' menu item to explore different solutions.
