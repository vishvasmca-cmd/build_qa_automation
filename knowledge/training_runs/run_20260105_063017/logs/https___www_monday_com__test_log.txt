        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I am on the landing page, and I should start by exploring the main navigation links such as 'Products', 'Solutions', 'Resources', and 'Pricing'. I will start with 'Products'.
    
        2. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The last action was clicking on the 'Products' menu. Now I will click on 'Platform overview' under the 'Products' menu to explore it. This will allow me to navigate further into the website and explore another main feature.
    
        3. I am on the monday.com platform page, which is a login screen. Since there are no credentials available in test_data, I will skip login and try to explore publicly accessible areas. Since there are no interactive elements available, I will explore the footer links.
    
        4. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I have already navigated to the platform overview page and scrolled down. Now I will click the 'Solutions' button in the header to navigate to the solutions page.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate and explore main features. The last action was clicking 'Solutions'. Now, I should explore one of the listed solutions, for example, 'Enterprise'.
    
        6. I am on the monday.com for Enterprise page, which appears to be a specific landing page. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already navigated to the 'Platform overview' page via the 'Products' menu, then scrolled, then navigated to the 'Enterprise' solutions page from the 'Solutions' menu. Now I will click on the 'AI' button in the menu bar to explore a new feature.
    
        7. I am on the monday.com Enterprise page, and I have already clicked on 'AI'. Now I will explore other main features of the site. Since the page context indicates that this page is for enterprise clients, I'll click on the 'Contact sales' button to explore that area.
    
        8. I am currently on the Contact Sales page, which contains a form. Since the smoke test involves navigating the site and exploring main features, filling out this form is not required, especially because no test data is available. Instead, I should navigate to other pages to explore the site. I will go to the 'Pricing' page next.
    
        9. I have navigated to the Contact Us page, clicked Pricing, and now I will click on Get Started to explore the sign-up flow. Since the goal is to navigate and explore, I should try and trigger a sign-up or demo request flow.
    
        10. I am on the pricing page. The goal is to navigate the site, explore the main features, and verify key elements. I have already explored Products, Solutions, AI, Contact Sales and attempted to click Pricing. I need to re-click the Pricing link since the previous click failed. The Pricing link will allow me to see the different pricing options available.
    
        11. I am on the pricing page. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to the pricing page. I will click on 'Try for free' to explore the features of the website.
    
        12. I am on the Pricing page. The goal is to navigate and explore main features. I have already tried to access the pricing page but had an issue initially. I will try clicking the 'Products' button to navigate to different product offerings as part of exploring the site. I am skipping the login, since test data is empty.
    
        13. The current page is the monday.com Pricing page, and the goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history indicates I have already navigated to the pricing page and clicked the 'Try for free' button, which seemed to lead back to the pricing page. I'll click on the Products menu to navigate the site, as clicking the products button again will not hurt.
    
        14. I'm currently on the monday.com pricing page. I have previously clicked on 'Products' twice. Now I will click on the monday.com logo in the top left corner of the page to return to the homepage, to explore the main features.
    
        15. I am on the homepage. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I am on the homepage, I will explore the 'Solutions' menu item.
    
        16. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Solutions'. Next, I will explore the 'Products' menu.
    
        17. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, exploring main features and verifying key elements. I have already navigated back to the homepage, but I am currently on a login screen. Since I do not have credentials I will proceed to the menu to continue exploring the site. I have already explored the Solutions and Products tabs. I will now explore the 'AI' tab.
    
        18. I have successfully navigated to the AI page. Now, I should explore main features. Since I am on the AI page, I will click on the first 'AI' button to explore that feature.
    
        19. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Currently, I am on the AI page. I have already clicked on the AI button and am on the correct page. I will explore the AI button again.
    
        20. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I am currently on the AI landing page. I will click on the 'Products' button to navigate to the products page and explore the different products offered by monday.com.
