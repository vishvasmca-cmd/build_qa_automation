        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. I am on the Bitbucket landing page. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. Since I am on the login screen and have no credentials, I should skip login and explore publicly accessible areas. I will start by clicking on the 'Why Bitbucket' button to learn more about the product.
    
        2. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. The last action clicked 'Why Bitbucket'. Now, I will click the 'Pricing' link to explore another main feature.
    
        3. I am on the pricing page as intended. Since I have no login credentials, I will skip the login part and instead explore the public areas such as navigation or footer links to continue with the smoke test.
    
        4. I am currently on the pricing page, and I have already scrolled down. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements. I will now click on the 'Why Bitbucket' link in the header to navigate to a different section of the site.
    
        5. I am currently on the pricing page, as confirmed by the page title and URL in the history. My goal is to explore the main features of the site and verify key elements for smoke testing. I have already clicked 'Why Bitbucket' and 'Pricing' and scrolled the pricing page. Since I'm already on the Pricing page, I will click one of the feature buttons to explore.
    
        6. The current goal is to perform a smoke test, which involves exploring main features and verifying key elements. The previous steps have navigated to the pricing page and clicked on 'Why Bitbucket' and 'User limit per instance'. Now, let's click on another button to explore the page further. I'll click on 'Build minutes'.
    
        7. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I've already clicked 'Why Bitbucket' and 'Pricing', and also I explored some features by clicking on 'User limit per instance' and 'Build minutes' on the pricing page. Now I will click on the 'Sign in' button to check login screen.
    
        8. I am on the Bitbucket Pricing page, and I have already clicked on several elements. The previous click was on the 'Sign in' button. I don't have any credentials, so I will explore other public areas instead of logging in. I will navigate back to the home page by clicking on 'Why Bitbucket'.
    
        9. The last action failed because the target element was not found. The current page is a login page, and the goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test which doesn't require logging in. I will skip the login and instead explore the 'Create an account' link to continue exploring the website.
    
        10. I am currently on the Atlassian Account signup page. I have no credentials to create an account, and my goal is to explore the main features. Since I cannot sign up, I will navigate back to the Bitbucket homepage to continue exploring public areas of the site.
    
        11. The goal is to explore the main features of the Bitbucket site. Since I'm back on the homepage after the last navigation, I'll explore the 'Why Bitbucket' button again to see where it leads, since it appeared to work the first time, but led to a dead end.
    
        12. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I previously clicked on "Why Bitbucket". I will click on the 'Pricing' link next to explore another main feature.
    
        13. I have already navigated to the pricing page and explored some of the interactive elements. My current goal is 'Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements'. I will explore more key features on the pricing page, specifically the 'Learn more' links.
    
        14. The user's goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. The current page is the Bitbucket Pricing page. I have already clicked on 'Why Bitbucket', 'User limit per instance', 'Build minutes', 'Sign in', 'Create an account', navigated to the homepage, and clicked on 'Pricing' and 'Learn more'. Now, I will attempt to click another 'Learn more' button to explore further.
    
        15. I've clicked on a couple of 'Learn more' links already. Let's click on another 'Learn more' link to further explore the pricing page and satisfy the goal to explore main features and verify key elements. I will choose the 'Learn More' associated with Code insights.
    
        16. I am on the Bitbucket Pricing page. I have already clicked several 'Learn more' buttons. The goal is to do autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements. I will click on the Atlassian logo to navigate back to the home page.
    
        17. I have returned to the Atlassian homepage. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I will now click on the 'Products' link to explore the available products.
    
        18. The previous step was clicking on the 'Products' menu. Now, I'll navigate through some of the products listed to fulfil the goal of exploring the main features. I will click the 'Jira' link in the products section.
    
        19. I've navigated to the Atlassian homepage and clicked on 'Products' then 'Jira'. Now I will click on Confluence to explore another main product as the goal is to explore main features.
    
        20. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already navigated to the site, clicked on Products, Jira, and Confluence. Next, I will click on Solutions to explore the site further.
