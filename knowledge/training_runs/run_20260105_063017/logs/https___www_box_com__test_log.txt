        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I am on the homepage, which is also a login screen. I will explore the 'Products' menu. This will allow exploration of main features.
    
        2. I have already clicked on the 'Products' menu item. Now I will explore the 'Solutions' dropdown menu to further explore the site's features, which is a part of the smoke test goal.
    
        3. I have already clicked on 'Products' and 'Solutions'. Now I will click on 'Industries' button to navigate to industries page.
    
        4. The page is a security check before accessing the Box.com website. I will skip the security check by clicking the available link, as there are no credentials to bypass this check.
    
        5. I am currently on a Cloudflare security check page. The previous action was clicking on a 'Cloudflare' link, which led to this page. There are no credentials in test_data for me to attempt a login. My goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I cannot proceed past the security check, I will navigate back to the homepage to find public links to explore.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I've already clicked on 'Products', 'Solutions', and 'Industries'. The last action was to navigate back to the home page. Now I'll explore the Products menu again to see a different set of options.
    
        7. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site. I've already clicked on 'Products' and 'Solutions' and 'Industries'. Now, I will explore the 'Financial Services' link under the 'Industries' menu to further explore main features.
    
        8. The current page is a Cloudflare security check page, and the page context indicates no buttons are visible. My history shows multiple clicks and navigations. Since there are no interactive elements on the page, I will attempt to navigate back to the main Box.com site to bypass this security check. This might allow me to explore the main features as intended by the smoke test.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to the homepage and clicked on 'Products' and 'Financial Services'. Now I should click on another main feature. Let's try 'Solutions'.
    
        10. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked on 'Products' and 'Solutions' buttons and also navigated back to the home page a couple of times. I should now click on Get Started button to explore another feature.
    
        11. I've navigated to the homepage and clicked the 'Solutions' button and 'Close' button. Now I will explore main features by clicking the 'Products' button again.
    
        12. I'm currently on the Box.com homepage and need to continue exploring main features. The goal is to navigate site and explore main features. Since I clicked 'Products' button already in the last turn, I will scroll to the end of the page.
    
        13. I have already navigated the page, clicked on 'Products', and 'Solutions', and scrolled. Now, I will click on 'See all products & features' to explore the available products.
    
        14. The current page is a security check page, likely presented by Cloudflare. This indicates a problem with the previous action. To move past this, I'll click on the available Cloudflare link. This might refresh the page or direct us to a page explaining the security measures. After this, I can attempt to navigate to the main site again.
    
        15. I am on a Cloudflare security check page after clicking a link on Box.com. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features. Since I don't have credentials to bypass the check, I should navigate back to the main page and explore public links instead.
    
        16. I have explored some products and features. Now I will click on Solutions to explore solutions provided by Box. Then, I'll explore more products and features.
    
        17. I've already explored Solutions and Products menus, clicked on 'See all products & features' and ended up in a Cloudflare error page. I should go back to the home page and click Products again and click on one of the options in the drop-down menu. I will click on 'Overview Intelligent Content Management'.
    
        18. I am currently on a security check page before accessing the box.com website. The history shows that I have previously navigated to the site and clicked on various elements. Since I am now presented with a security check page, I will attempt to navigate to box.com again to see if I can bypass this page. There are no other options presented to bypass the check and no credentials provided.
    
        19. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. The last action navigated back to the homepage. Let's click on a different solution to explore the site further. I will click on 'Industries'.
    
        20. The goal is to explore main features and verify key elements of the Box website. I have already clicked on 'Industries'. Now I will click on 'Financial Services' to explore the industries page.
