--- Step 1 ---
🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/
📍 On Page: Tutorials Point
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 524 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The current page is the login screen. Since no credentials are provided in `test_data`, I will skip the login and try to navigate to the home page to explore the main features. Clicking on the 'Home' link should navigate to the home page.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("link", { name: "Home" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=1 (Home)
💾 Trace saved to projects/https___www_tutorialspoint_com__regression/outputs/trace.json
💾 Passive Collection: 524 elements saved.

--- Step 2 ---
🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm
📍 On Page: TutorialsPoint
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 470 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The goal is to navigate and explore the site. I've already clicked the 'Home' button. Now, I will click on the 'Categories' button to explore available categories.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("button", { name: "Categories" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=55 (Categories)
💾 Trace saved to projects/https___www_tutorialspoint_com__regression/outputs/trace.json
💾 Passive Collection: 470 elements saved.

--- Step 3 ---
🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/top-categories.htm
📍 On Page: Top Categories - Tutorials Point
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 0 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The page context indicates a login screen, but there are no credentials in `test_data`. As per the instructions, I will skip login. Since I've already navigated to the categories page, I'll navigate to the home page to continue exploring the site.

🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm
📍 On Page: TutorialsPoint - Home
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 470 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already navigated to the home page, clicked on categories and then navigated back to the home page. Now I will explore main features by clicking on a course.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("link", { name: "Courses" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=62 (Courses)

🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://market.tutorialspoint.com/index.asp
📍 On Page: TutorialsPoint
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 0 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I am on the login screen, and I don't have any login credentials in the test_data. I should explore publicly accessible areas. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. Since I don't have credentials and the last action was to click on courses, I will navigate to the home page to explore other features.

🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm
📍 On Page: Tutorials Point
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 470 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows I've already navigated to the home page and clicked on Categories and Courses, navigating back to the home page after each click. Next, I should click on 'Library' to explore another main feature.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("link", { name: "Library" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=61 (Library)

🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tutorialslibrary.htm
📍 On Page: TutorialsPoint Library
🤔 State: login_screen
📡 Sending 1335 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I am currently on the TutorialsPoint Library page, which is a login screen. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since there are no credentials provided in test_data, I will explore publicly accessible areas. I will click on the 'Tutorials and Articles' link, as it is a main feature.
   ✨ Refined: page.get_by_role("link", { name: "Articles" })
🖱️ Clicking ID=5 (Tutorials And Articles)
💾 Trace saved to projects/https___www_tutorialspoint_com__regression/outputs/trace.json
💾 Passive Collection: 1335 elements saved.

--- Step 8 ---
🔍 Mining Page (2026 Strategy): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/articles/index.php
📍 On Page: TutorialsPoint Articles
🤔 State: dashboard
📡 Sending 0 elements to the Planner...
💭 Thought: I have navigated to multiple sections of the website already. I am now on the Tutorials and Articles page. Since the elements list is empty I cannot click any further links. I will mark this as completed.
