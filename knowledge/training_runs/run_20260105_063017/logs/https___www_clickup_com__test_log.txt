        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Since I'm on the homepage, I'll start by exploring the 'Product' menu to see the available features.
    
        2. The goal is to perform an autonomous smoke test, which includes exploring main features. I have already clicked on 'Product'. Now I will click on 'Solutions' to further explore the site's main features.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I've already clicked 'Product' and 'Solutions'. Now I will click 'Learn'.
    
        4. The page is the ClickUp Home page and the goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows I have already clicked the 'Product', 'Solutions', and 'Learn' buttons. Now I will click the 'Pricing' button to explore the pricing page.
    
        5. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore the main features, and verify key elements. I've already clicked on Product, Solutions, Learn, and Pricing. Now I can explore the 'Brain AI' button.
    
        6. I am currently on the pricing page. I have already clicked on the Product, Solutions, Learn, Pricing, and Brain AI buttons. Next, I will click on the Contact Sales button in the navigation bar to explore another main feature of the site, as directed by the goal.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. Based on the history, I've already clicked on 'Product', 'Solutions', 'Learn', 'Pricing', 'Brain AI', and 'Contact Sales'. Now I will click on the 'Sign Up' button.
    
        8. I have already navigated to the pricing page and explored the 'Product', 'Solutions', 'Learn', 'Brain AI', 'Contact Sales', and 'Sign Up' buttons. Now I will explore other areas of the pricing page to verify key elements. I will start by toggling the pricing display between monthly and yearly.
    
        9. The current page is the ClickUp Pricing page. I have already explored the main navigation, clicked on several buttons. Now I will explore the available 'Get Started' buttons to explore the features further.
