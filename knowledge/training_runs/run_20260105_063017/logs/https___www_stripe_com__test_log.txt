        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The current page is the Stripe homepage. There are no credentials available, so I will skip the login. I will start by exploring the 'Products' menu to see the available products.
    
        2. I am on the homepage of Stripe. I previously clicked the 'Products' button. The next step is to explore other main features. I will click on 'Solutions' button to explore the solutions provided by stripe.
    
        3. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked 'Products' and 'Solutions'. Next, I will click on 'Developers'.
    
        4. I have already clicked 'Products', 'Solutions', and 'Developers'. Now I will click on 'Resources' to continue exploring the main features of the site as requested in the goal.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on 'Products', 'Solutions', 'Developers', and 'Resources'. Next, I will click on the 'Pricing' button to explore another main feature of the site.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I've already clicked Products, Solutions, Developers, Resources, and Pricing. The page context indicates I'm currently on the Pricing page. I should now click on one of the payment options to explore its features, since the goal includes verifying key elements.
    
        7. The goal is to navigate and explore the main features of the Stripe site. I've already clicked through Products, Solutions, Developers, Resources, Pricing, and Payments. Next, I will continue exploring the features on the Pricing page by clicking 'Payment Links No-code payments'.
    
        8. I have already clicked on Products, Solutions, Developers, Resources, Pricing, Payments and Payment links. Now, I will click on the 'Checkout' link to continue exploring the main features as per the goal.
    
        9. I've already navigated to the pricing page and clicked on 'Payments', 'Payment Links' and 'Checkout'. The next step is to click on 'Elements' to explore another main feature as requested by the user's goal to autonomously smoke test and explore main features.
    
        10. I have navigated to the pricing page and clicked a number of the options displayed there including Payments, Payment Links, Checkout, and Elements. I'll continue exploring the pricing page by clicking the Terminal pricing option.
    
        11. I have already clicked through all the available menu items, and am on the pricing page. Now I will click on the Radar link. I will click on 'Radar Fraud prevention'
    
        12. I am on the Pricing page. I have explored the main navigation ('Solutions', 'Developers', 'Resources', 'Pricing'), and then several links on the page ('Payments', 'Payment Links', 'Checkout', 'Elements', 'Terminal', 'Radar'). There are still several links on the page. I will click Authorization to explore another part of the site.
    
        13. I've clicked most of the elements. I am going to explore 'Support'.
