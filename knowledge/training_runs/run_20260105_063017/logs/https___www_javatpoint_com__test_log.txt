💭 Thought: I have navigated to the Google About page. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. Based on the history, I first navigated to Google, then clicked on 'About'. However, in the last step, I mistakenly clicked 'Store' (which wasn't part of the main navigation). I should correct this and navigate back to the main 'About' page links. Since the provided 'elements' is empty and does not reflect the correct page layout (missing navigation links), I will use the previous 'About' link target text to try and navigate back to the main navigation.
