        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I'm on the Zoom home page. I should start by exploring the 'Products' menu to see what is offered. No login data is available, so I will avoid login.
    
        2. The goal is to autonomously smoke test the Zoom website, exploring main features and verifying key elements. I have already clicked on the 'Products' button. Now I will click on the 'Solutions' button to navigate to that section of the website.
    
        3. I have already clicked on 'Products' and 'Solutions'. Now I will click on 'Pricing' to explore another main feature as per the goal.
    
        4. I've successfully navigated to the pricing page. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. Since I'm on the pricing page, I should now look for elements to interact with on this page to further explore the site. Since the element list is empty, I will scroll to see if this reveals additional elements.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows that I clicked on 'Products', 'Solutions' and 'Pricing'. The current page is the Zoom Pricing page. I will now click on AI to explore another main feature.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. I have already clicked on Products, Solutions, Pricing, and AI. Now I will scroll again to ensure the whole page is loaded.
    
        7. I have already navigated to the pricing page and explored AI features and scrolled to the bottom of the page. Now, I will click the 'Meet' button to explore another main feature of the website. Since there is no specific order, this action will help fulfill the goal of exploring main features.
    
        8. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. I have already clicked on 'Products', 'Solutions', 'Pricing', 'AI', and 'Meet'. Now I will scroll again, to check for other features and elements.
    
        9. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. So far, I have clicked on 'Products', 'Solutions', 'Pricing', 'AI', and 'Meet'. I will now click on 'Sign Up Free'.
    
        10. The page context indicates that I am on the Zoom Pricing Plans page. The previous actions were clicks and scrolls on the pricing page, and I have already clicked 'Sign Up Free' on the pricing page, which should have navigated me to another page. Currently, there are no interactive elements on the page, so I should try navigating to the homepage to continue exploring other main features. Therefore, I will navigate to the Zoom homepage.
    
        11. The goal is to do a smoke test by exploring main features and verifying key elements. I have already clicked through several navigation buttons. Now I will scroll to the bottom of the page and click on some of the footer links.
    
        12. The goal is an autonomous smoke test including exploring the main features and verifying key elements. I have already clicked Solutions, Pricing, AI, Meet, Sign Up Free, and scrolled a few times. I will continue exploring main features by clicking on the Products button.
    
        13. The user's goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I have already clicked on pricing, scrolled, clicked on AI, Meet, signed up free, navigated back to the home page, and clicked on products. Now I need to explore the products menu that has been opened. I will click on Meetings.
    
        14. I have successfully navigated to the Zoom virtual meeting product page after clicking on 'Products' and then 'Meetings'. Now I should scroll to explore the main features and verify key elements of the page. Since the 'elements' list is empty, I will scroll to the bottom of the page.
    
        15. I have already navigated to the main features by clicking on products and scrolling. Now I will explore more of the site by clicking on the Solutions button.
    
        16. I have already navigated to the Zoom Virtual Meetings page and clicked on the Solutions button. Now I should try to click on the 'Meet' button to explore that section. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features.
    
        17. The goal is to explore the main features of the website. I've already clicked on 'Products', 'Meetings', and 'Solutions'. Next, I will try to click on 'Pricing' to explore the pricing page.
    
        18. The current page is the Zoom pricing page. I have already navigated to this page in step 16. Since there are no elements available and the page context shows 'login_screen', it seems the page is not loading properly. I will try to refresh the page by navigating to the homepage.
    
        19. The goal is to navigate the site and explore the main features. So far, I have navigated to the zoom homepage, scrolled, clicked Products, Meetings, Solutions, Meet and Pricing. Next I will explore the Support page.
    
        20. I have already navigated to the site, scrolled, clicked on Products, Meetings, Solutions, Meet, Pricing, navigated to the homepage again, and clicked Support. I should now explore the AI feature to explore another main feature. It seems like I'm on the support page now. I'll click AI.
