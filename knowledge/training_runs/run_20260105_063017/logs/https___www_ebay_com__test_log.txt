        Autonomous smoke test: Navigate site, explore main features, verify key elements
    
        Test Steps:
    
        1. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. Since I'm on the homepage, I will start by clicking on 'Shop by category' to explore the available categories. I am skipping login as there is no test_data.
    
        2. I have clicked on the 'Shop by category' button. Now I should explore one of the presented main categories like 'Motors'.
    
        3. I have already clicked 'Shop by category' and 'Motors'. Now I will click on 'Car and truck parts' to explore one of the main categories. This continues exploring main features as per the goal.
    
        4. The goal is to perform a smoke test by navigating the site and exploring main features. I have already clicked 'Shop by category', 'Motors', and 'Car and truck parts'. Now I will click on another major category 'Vehicles' to continue exploring the site.
    
        5. The goal is to navigate the site, explore main features, and verify key elements. I am currently on the eBay Motors page, which appears to be a login screen. I need to click on one of the main buttons to explore the features. I will click on the 'Car and truck parts' button.
    
        6. The goal is to navigate the site and explore main features. The history shows that I've already clicked on 'Shop by category', 'Motors', 'Car and truck parts', 'Vehicles', and 'Car and truck parts' again. The current page is the eBay Motors homepage. I will now click on 'Wheels and tires' to further explore the site's features.
    
        7. I have clicked on 'Shop by category' then navigated to 'Motors' and clicked 'Car and truck parts', 'Vehicles', 'Car and truck parts' and 'Wheels and tires' to explore the main features. Now I will click on 'Motorcycle parts' to continue exploring.
    
        8. I have already clicked on multiple categories on the page. Now I will click on "ATV, UTV, and side-by-side parts" to continue exploring main features.
    
        9. I have clicked through several categories, including Vehicles, Car and Truck Parts, Wheels and Tires, Motorcycle Parts, and ATV, UTV, and Side-by-Side parts. Now I will click on 'Boat parts' to further explore main features.
    
        10. I have already clicked through several main categories on the auto parts and vehicles page. I will now click through the links available in the Boat parts sections, such as Accessories and gear.
    
        11. I am on the Boat Accessories & Gear page on eBay. I have already navigated to this page through the following steps: Home > Shop by category > Motors > Boat parts > Accessories and gear. Now, I will explore the page by clicking the first category available, which is 'Covers'.
