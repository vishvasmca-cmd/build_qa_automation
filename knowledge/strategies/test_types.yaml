  smoke:
    definition: "A minimal set of 'Happy Path' tests that verify the system's most critical functions are working. If these fail, the build is rejected."
    scope:
      - "Critical Paths (e.g., Login, Checkout, Patient Registration)"
      - "Core Business Logic (Primary Revenue/Operation Flows)"
      - "No negative testing (unless critical security)"
      - "No complex edge cases"
    examples:
      - "User can login with valid credentials"
      - "User can add item to cart and proceed to checkout"
      - "Patient can book an appointment successfully"
      
  regression:
    definition: "A comprehensive suite of tests ensuring that recent changes have not broken existing functionality. Covers variations, edge cases, and error handling."
    scope:
      - "Alternative Flows (e.g., Payment with PayPal vs Credit Card)"
      - "Negative Scenarios (e.g., Invalid Login, Out of Stock)"
      - "Boundary Analysis (e.g., Min/Max quantities)"
      - "Cross-Module Interactions (e.g., Cart update reflects in Header)"
      - "Validation Messages (e.g., 'Email is required')"
    examples:
      - "User cannot login with invalid password"
      - "User sees error when checking out with empty cart"
      - "System handles 100+ items in cart gracefully"
