- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume the page is fully loaded immediately after navigation; ALWAYS wait for a specific element or condition to be met before interacting with the page.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement explicit waits for critical elements to appear or for specific network requests to complete, instead of relying solely on load state events.
