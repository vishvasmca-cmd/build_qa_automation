- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T use generic locators like 'button' without specifying additional attributes (e.g., id, class, text) to ensure uniqueness.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO use more specific locators, such as 'get_by_role' or 'get_by_text', to target the desired element accurately. Leverage the element's unique attributes like ID or text content.
