- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement robust error handling for network-related errors like `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR` when navigating to a page, including retries or alternative navigation strategies.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for `page.goto()` calls, especially for critical pages like the homepage.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume that the target website (dyson.in) will always correctly handle HTTP/2 protocol negotiation; implement retry mechanisms or fallback strategies.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement retry logic with exponential backoff for page navigation, especially when encountering network-related errors like `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume a website is reachable without proper error handling for network-related exceptions during `page.goto()` calls.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for `page.goto()` calls, especially when dealing with external websites, to handle transient network errors.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement robust error handling for network-related exceptions, especially when using `page.goto()`, and consider retrying with a different protocol version or browser context if HTTP/2 errors are encountered.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for `page.goto()` calls, especially for initial page loads. Also, consider adding a check for basic network connectivity before attempting to navigate.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume that HTTP/2 protocol is stable; implement retry logic with fallback to HTTP/1.1 if HTTP/2 fails during initial page load.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement robust error handling for network-related errors during page navigation, including retries and logging of detailed error information.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume that the target website's HTTP/2 configuration is always stable and compatible with Playwright's default settings.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for initial page navigation, especially when dealing with HTTP/2.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for `page.goto()` calls, especially when dealing with external websites, to handle transient network or server errors.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume the website is always reachable and correctly configured for HTTP/2. Implement robust error handling for page navigation failures.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for initial page load, especially when dealing with external websites. Also, DO add a check for network connectivity before attempting to navigate.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume that HTTP/2 protocol errors are client-side issues; investigate server-side configurations and network stability first.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement robust error handling for network-related issues, including HTTP/2 protocol errors, and consider adding retry mechanisms or falling back to HTTP/1.1 if HTTP/2 fails.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement robust error handling for page navigation, including catching network errors and potentially retrying with a different protocol or after a delay.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume the website is always reachable and stable; implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for navigation.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for `page.goto()` calls, especially for initial page loads.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement robust error handling around `page.goto()` calls, including catching network errors and potentially retrying with HTTP/1.1 if HTTP/2 fails.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume that the target website (dyson.in) will always reliably support HTTP/2 without potential protocol negotiation errors.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms when navigating to a page, especially when dealing with HTTP/2.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume that HTTP/2 protocol errors are solely client-side issues; investigate server-side configurations and network stability.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement retry logic with exponential backoff for `page.goto()` calls, especially for initial page loads, to handle transient network or server-side issues.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume that HTTP/2 protocol errors are solely client-side issues; ALWAYS investigate potential server-side problems or network configurations.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume that the target website (dyson.in) will always reliably support HTTP/2. Implement retry mechanisms and consider handling potential protocol errors gracefully.

- ✅ PREFERRED: DO implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms when navigating to external websites, especially when dealing with HTTP/2, to mitigate potential network or server-side issues.

- ⚠️ PROHIBITED: DON'T assume a website will always successfully load on the first attempt; network errors and server issues can occur.
