learned_rules:
- When specifying Windows file paths in Python strings, always use raw strings (r'path')
  or escape backslashes ('\\') to avoid UnicodeDecodeError exceptions.
- When clicking navigation links (like 'Playwright' or elements that navigate to 'Home
  page'), implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff due to potential loading
  delays or animations.
