learned_rules:
- When targeting elements within a 'sticky' header, confirm the header is fully loaded
  and stable before attempting to locate child elements. Avoid chaining `get_by_role`
  directly if the initial locator might not return a single, predictable element.
  Consider using more robust selectors that target specific IDs or classes within
  the header.
- Before pushing code, always validate the correctness of regular expressions using
  a linter or online regex tester to avoid syntax errors that prevent test execution.
- Ensure all string literals (single or double quotes) are properly terminated within
  test files to avoid SyntaxError during test collection.
- When navigating to the homepage, prioritize using a more specific and resilient
  locator than `a[href='/']`. The root element may not be reliably available, or may
  be obscured by a loading screen or other dynamic content. Consider `img[alt='Career
  Raah']` or `div#logo a` instead, or waiting for networkidle.
- Verify code for indentation errors after defining functions or control statements.
  Use a linter to automatically check for indentation consistency.
- Verify code for syntax errors before executing, particularly indentation in Python.
- Ensure proper indentation in Python test files. Specifically, verify that code blocks
  within functions and control structures are correctly indented to avoid IndentationError.
- All variables used within test functions must be properly defined and initialized
  before use.
- Ensure consistent indentation in Python test files, particularly when using `page.locator().click()`
  or other Playwright methods within test functions.
- When defining Windows file paths in Python strings, always use raw strings (r'...')
  or escape backslashes ('\\') to avoid Unicode escape sequence errors.
