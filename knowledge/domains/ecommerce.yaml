learned_rules:
- Ensure pytest-playwright is installed and configured correctly in the test environment.
  Verify the 'page' fixture is available and correctly scoped for the tests.
- Ensure Playwright's `page` fixture is correctly configured and accessible in Pytest
  environments before running tests. Verify installation, configuration files (e.g.,
  pytest.ini or conftest.py), and fixture definitions.
- Ensure Playwright is correctly configured as a pytest plugin and that the 'page'
  fixture is properly injected into tests. Verify playwright.ini or pytest.ini configuration.
- Ensure all triple-quoted strings (docstrings and multiline comments) are properly
  terminated with a matching set of triple quotes (''' or """) within each module;
  validate code formatting through linting.
- When specifying file paths in Python, especially on Windows, use raw strings (r'path')
  or escape backslashes ('\\') to prevent them from being interpreted as escape sequences.
- If an action (like 'About Us') opens a modal/overlay, you MUST close it (click 'Close'
  button or press Esc) before interacting with other elements to prevent interception
  errors.
- When printing messages to the console, especially error messages that might be logged,
  ensure that the encoding is set to UTF-8 to support a wider range of characters,
  including emojis.
- When generating screenshot filenames or paths, avoid using Unicode characters, especially
  emojis, to prevent encoding errors in environments with limited character set support.
- Before interacting with sort options, ensure the dropdown is fully expanded and
  the options are visible. Check the display attribute.
- Before interacting with the product sorting dropdown, ensure that the dropdown is
  fully loaded and that all options are present in the DOM. Implement a retry mechanism
  with exponential backoff for cases where the dropdown options are not immediately
  available.
- When interacting with sort options, ensure the dropdown or list containing the options
  is fully loaded and visible before attempting to click a specific option. Implement
  a retry mechanism or increase the timeout if necessary.
- When interacting with dropdown menus, ensure the dropdown is fully expanded and
  visible before attempting to click on any option within it.
- Ensure that the `core` module (containing templates and helper functions) is correctly
  included in the Python path or project structure before running tests in the `projects/demo_complex`
  directory.
workflow_rules:
- Always search for a cart icon after adding an item.
- If login fails, check for error-message-container.
