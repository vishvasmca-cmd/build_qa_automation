- Before interacting with the search input on YouTube, ensure the page is fully loaded
  and stable. Consider using a longer timeout or explicitly waiting for a specific
  element related to page load completion.
- When searching on YouTube, implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  for handling cases where the search results page doesn't load within the initial
  timeout. Also, verify the presence of a 'No results found' element before retrying
  to avoid infinite loops if the search term yields no results.
- When navigating to a new section (e.g., 'sport' tab), increase the timeout for `wait_for_url`
  to accommodate potential delays in page loading or server response. Consider implementing
  a retry mechanism with incremental backoff for navigation events.
- After clicking the 'Cookie Settings' button on applovin.com, always wait for the
  cookie confirmation modal to appear before proceeding. If the modal does not appear
  within 10 seconds, the test should fail.
- When navigating to NIC.ru, anticipate a modal or advertisement with a close button.
  Implement a strategy to handle it before proceeding with the main test flow. Consider
  waiting for a shorter duration initially, or checking for the element's existence
  before attempting to click.
- Before attempting to click the 'Sign in' button, ensure that any overlaying elements
  (e.g., cookie banners, modals) are dismissed or that the button is fully visible
  and enabled. Consider adding an explicit wait for the button to be visible and stable.
- When clicking navigation elements on Yandex, especially those with localized text,
  implement retry logic with exponential backoff and consider using more robust locators
  like role-based selectors or data attributes if available. Account for potential
  A/B testing variations that might alter the text or presence of elements.
- Before attempting to interact with the search input field on nist.gov, ensure the
  page has fully loaded and the element is visible. Consider adding a wait_for_selector
  or wait_for_load_state before attempting to fill the field.
- Before attempting to click the 'Log in' button on Reddit, check for and dismiss
  any overlaying elements (e.g., modals, banners) that might obscure the button or
  intercept the click.
- Before clicking the 'Store' link, ensure the page is fully loaded and any overlaying
  elements (e.g., modals, banners) are dismissed. Consider adding a short wait or
  using `locator.wait_for()` with `state='visible'` or `state='stable'` before attempting
  to click.
- Before attempting to click the 'Sign in' link, ensure the page is fully loaded and
  the element is visible. Consider using a longer timeout or explicitly waiting for
  the element to be present.
- Ensure that the project's `core` module is correctly structured and accessible within
  the Python environment's import path before running tests.
- When interacting with elements that may load dynamically or be part of a carousel,
  increase the timeout or implement retry logic to account for potential delays in
  element visibility.
- Ensure all test files have access to necessary utility modules by verifying the
  correct relative or absolute import paths are used.
- Before asserting the visibility of the 'Download Teams' button, check for and dismiss
  any overlaying elements (e.g., cookie banners, promotional modals) that might obscure
  the button or prevent it from rendering correctly.
- Before asserting the visibility of the 'Contact Us' button, check for and dismiss
  any overlaying elements (e.g., cookie banners or modals) that might obscure it.
  Also, consider that the button text might be dynamic or localized.
- Ensure that the `core` directory containing `utils.py` is in the Python path or
  that relative imports are correctly configured within the project.
- When asserting the visibility of a button, especially on documentation pages, consider
  that the button might be dynamically loaded or part of a carousel/slider that is
  not immediately visible.  Increase the timeout or wait for a specific state before
  asserting visibility.
- Ensure that the 'core' directory and its modules are correctly placed within the
  project structure and that the Python path is configured to include the project's
  root directory.
- Before asserting the visibility of the 'Join now' button on the LinkedIn homepage,
  wait for the page to fully load and consider potential A/B testing variations or
  dynamic content loading.
- When navigating to cloudflare.com, anticipate a potentially slow 'networkidle' event.
  Increase the timeout or switch to 'domcontentloaded' if full network activity is
  not critical for the test.
- When navigating to x.com, anticipate potential delays in reaching the 'networkidle'
  state due to the dynamic nature of the content and third-party resources. Implement
  a more robust loading strategy.
- Ensure the `core` directory and its modules are correctly placed within the project
  structure and that the Python interpreter can resolve the import statement `from
  core.utils`.
- Before interacting with elements on the Google homepage, implement a retry mechanism
  with exponential backoff to handle potential loading delays or A/B testing variations.
  Also, consider using more robust locators that are less susceptible to UI changes,
  such as data attributes or ARIA labels.
- Before interacting with elements on the WhatsApp homepage, ensure the page is fully
  loaded and the target element is present in the DOM. Consider using a more robust
  locator strategy that is less prone to changes.
- When navigating to cloudflare.net, anticipate a potentially long initial load time
  due to numerous network requests. Consider increasing the default timeout or using
  a more specific load state (e.g., 'domcontentloaded') if the test doesn't require
  all network resources to be fully loaded.
- Verify the correct project structure and import paths before running tests. Ensure
  all necessary utility modules are accessible within the test environment.
- Ensure that all project dependencies and modules are correctly installed and accessible
  in the Python environment before running tests. Verify the project's directory structure
  and update Python import paths if necessary.
- Ensure the `core` directory (containing `utils.py`) is in the Python path or that
  relative imports are correctly configured within the project.
- When needing to scroll to a specific element using Playwright, ensure the correct
  method is used.  `Locator` objects do not have a `scroll()` method.  Consider using
  `page.evaluate` with `scrollIntoView` or `page.locator(<locator>).scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()`.
- Ensure that all module dependencies are correctly specified and accessible within
  the project's directory structure. Verify that the PYTHONPATH environment variable
  is correctly set if the module is located outside the project's root directory.
- When waiting for navigation to a login page, check for common redirect loops or
  intermediate pages that might be delaying or preventing the final navigation. Implement
  checks for these scenarios and adjust the wait conditions accordingly.
- Ensure the `core` directory and its modules are correctly included in the Python
  path or project structure before running tests.
- When navigating to the 'about' page on x.com, implement a retry mechanism with exponential
  backoff to handle potential slow server responses or intermittent network issues.
  Also, verify the 'about' link is present and enabled before clicking.
