- Before interacting with the search input on YouTube, ensure the page is fully loaded
  and stable. Consider using a longer timeout or explicitly waiting for a specific
  element related to page load completion.
- When searching on YouTube, implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  for handling cases where the search results page doesn't load within the initial
  timeout. Also, verify the presence of a 'No results found' element before retrying
  to avoid infinite loops if the search term yields no results.
- When navigating to a new section (e.g., 'sport' tab), increase the timeout for `wait_for_url`
  to accommodate potential delays in page loading or server response. Consider implementing
  a retry mechanism with incremental backoff for navigation events.
- After clicking the 'Cookie Settings' button on applovin.com, always wait for the
  cookie confirmation modal to appear before proceeding. If the modal does not appear
  within 10 seconds, the test should fail.
- When navigating to NIC.ru, anticipate a modal or advertisement with a close button.
  Implement a strategy to handle it before proceeding with the main test flow. Consider
  waiting for a shorter duration initially, or checking for the element's existence
  before attempting to click.
