- Before interacting with the search input on YouTube, ensure the page is fully loaded
  and stable. Consider using a longer timeout or explicitly waiting for a specific
  element related to page load completion.
- When searching on YouTube, implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  for handling cases where the search results page doesn't load within the initial
  timeout. Also, verify the presence of a 'No results found' element before retrying
  to avoid infinite loops if the search term yields no results.
