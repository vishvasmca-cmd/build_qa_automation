learned_rules:
- Before interacting with any element critical for the main workflow (e.g., after
  login), ensure the page is fully loaded and the expected URL is reached. Implement
  explicit waiting strategies and URL validation to handle potential navigation issues.
- When asserting the URL using Playwright's `expect` function, ensure that it's being
  called on the `page` object (e.g., `expect(page).to_have_url(...)`).
- After navigating to the login page, always wait for the element containing the 'Login
  Form' header to be visible before proceeding with any assertions or actions.
- When targeting elements with common text like 'Book Store', ensure the locator is
  specific enough to target the desired element. Use exact match or refine with additional
  attributes if necessary. Consider get_by_role or get_by_title.
- Before clicking 'All in One' link, ensure the page is fully loaded and all dynamic
  content has rendered. Consider adding an explicit wait for a specific element on
  the page to ensure stability before proceeding.
- Verify the application does not redirect from the intended URL (e.g., with versioning)
  to the base URL.
- After clicking the 'Sign up' link, verify a successful navigation away from the
  home page before proceeding with subsequent actions. Add wait_for_url() with a specific
  target URL.
- Before interacting with the customer registration form, ensure the form is fully
  loaded and visible.  Consider adding a conditional check for the presence of a parent
  element or an explicit wait for the form to be attached to the DOM.
- After clicking the login button on the demo app, always check for an error message
  or a redirect to the expected logged-in state (e.g., account dashboard) instead
  of just the logout button.
- When using page object model, always use `self.page` to refer current page instance
  within a page object class method.
- After searching for a book in the bookstore, verify that the search results are
  filtered correctly to return only the expected book and no extraneous results.
