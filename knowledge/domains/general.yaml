learned_rules:
- Before interacting with any element critical for the main workflow (e.g., after
  login), ensure the page is fully loaded and the expected URL is reached. Implement
  explicit waiting strategies and URL validation to handle potential navigation issues.
- When asserting the URL using Playwright's `expect` function, ensure that it's being
  called on the `page` object (e.g., `expect(page).to_have_url(...)`).
- After navigating to the login page, always wait for the element containing the 'Login
  Form' header to be visible before proceeding with any assertions or actions.
- When targeting elements with common text like 'Book Store', ensure the locator is
  specific enough to target the desired element. Use exact match or refine with additional
  attributes if necessary. Consider get_by_role or get_by_title.
- Before clicking 'All in One' link, ensure the page is fully loaded and all dynamic
  content has rendered. Consider adding an explicit wait for a specific element on
  the page to ensure stability before proceeding.
- Verify the application does not redirect from the intended URL (e.g., with versioning)
  to the base URL.
