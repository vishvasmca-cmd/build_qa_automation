learned_rules:
- Always ensure locator strings are properly defined and assigned a value before being
  used in page interactions.
- Before pushing code to the repository, always use a linter or IDE to ensure correct
  Python syntax and indentation to prevent collection errors.
- Ensure all variables used in conditional statements or function calls are properly
  defined and initialized before being referenced.
- Ensure consistent indentation within Python test files.  Specifically, check indentation
  after control flow statements (if, for, while) and function/class definitions.
- Ensure proper indentation in Python test files.  Verify indentation after any code
  modifications, especially within loops or conditional statements.
- Ensure consistent and correct indentation in Python test files, especially when
  using `page.locator().click()` or other Playwright methods within functions or control
  flow structures. Use an IDE or linter to enforce consistent indentation.
- Ensure all triple-quoted strings (docstrings, multiline strings) are properly terminated
  in Python test files before execution. Lint code before committing.
- When using regular expressions within test code to parse strings, ensure that special
  characters like parentheses, brackets, and quotes are properly escaped to avoid
  syntax errors.
