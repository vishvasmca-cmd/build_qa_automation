learned_rules:
- When asserting URL changes after navigation, ensure the correct Playwright assertion
  method is used. If asserting that the URL *contains* a specific string, utilize
  `expect(page).to_have_url(/.*register.htm/)` with a regex.  Validate navigation
  success with explicit waits and locator checks on the target page.
- All regular expressions within test code must be syntactically correct to ensure
  proper parsing and execution. Use a linter or code checker to validate regex patterns
  before running tests.
- Before clicking the 'Log In' button, ensure that no modal dialogs or overlays are
  present that might obscure or prevent interaction with the button. Consider using
  a broader or more robust locator strategy that accounts for potential dynamic content.
