learned_rules:
- Ensure consistent indentation throughout Python test files to avoid syntax errors
  during test collection and execution. Utilize a linter to automatically check for
  and correct indentation issues before running tests.
- Ensure all Python code adheres to proper indentation rules before running tests.
- When using Playwright's `fill` method, ensure that the selector provided is a valid
  CSS selector, or use other Playwright locator strategies. Avoid embedding Playwright's
  `get_by_role` inside a CSS selector.
- Verify Playwright API method names before using them. Consult the official Playwright
  documentation for correct method names and usage.
- When using Playwright, ensure that the correct methods are called on Locator objects.
  Refer to the Playwright documentation for available methods (e.g., `fill`, `type`).
- Verify Playwright API usage for filling input fields. Use `fill()` or `type()` methods
  for entering text into input fields obtained through locators.
- When targeting elements with the text 'Billing', use more specific locators such
  as role=button or ID selectors to avoid ambiguity and strict mode violations.
- When using Playwright, always verify that the method called on a Locator object
  exists in the current version of the Playwright API. Use `fill` method instead of
  `smart_fill`.
