# ISP/Telecommunications Domain Patterns

## Common Workflows
1. **Account Login** → View Bill → Pay Bill
2. **Service Management** → Upgrade/Downgrade Plan
3. **Support** → Troubleshoot Connection → Create Ticket
4. **Usage Monitoring** → Check Data Usage → View Speed Test

## Critical Elements to Test

### Account Management

- Equipment rentals

### Support & Troubleshooting

### Compliance

## Locator Patterns

- `.plan-details`, `.service-tier`
